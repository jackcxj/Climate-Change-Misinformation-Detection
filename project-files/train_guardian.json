{"webpage":[{"title":"Imagine the UK getting rid of road rage, congestion and exhaust fumes for ever","paragraph":"I\nt was a grim irony that the best transport news in ages was buried in the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. On 26 March, the government published a document, Decarbonising Transport, which went further in facing up to the problem of emissions from air and vehicle traffic than most campaigners had dared to hope for.\nThe challenge is enormous. In 2016, transport overtook energy to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions. Motor vehicles on their own are responsible for around a fifth of the total. On aviation, the UK is the world’s third-worst polluter, behind China and the US.\nBut here was the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, declaring that “public transport and active travel will be the natural first choice”, adding “we will use our cars less” for anyone who missed the point. Transport was to be a centrepiece of the UK’s preparations for the postponed Cop26 climate talks. Finally, it appeared we were on the way to grasping the nettle of our polluting driving and flying habits.\nSix weeks on, we are in a different world. Travel of all sorts has collapsed: there were 90% fewer flights from European airports in April compared with a year ago. In the UK there are just 5% of the normal number of rail journeys, while road traffic has fallen to levels last seen in 1955. In the short-term, this means steep drops in emissions: one estimate says the UK’s have fallen by 36%. But already experts are warning that unless strong action is taken, any temporary benefits could be quickly erased.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nProbably the biggest risk is that governments will take their eye off the climate emergency, bailing out airlines and car manufacturers as they have already bailed out oil companies. But while some observers have pointed to the collapse in vehicle sales as the beginning of the end for petrol and diesel, other voices warn of the even greater risk to public transport due to worries over being able to maintain social distancing. Last month Milan’s leaders declared their determination to avoid a surge in car use, even if residents were reluctant to return to trains, trams and buses. “If everybody drives, there is no space for people, there is no space to move,” said the city’s deputy mayor Marco Granelli.\nMilan’s authorities are among the leaders of a group of mayors working together worldwide on plans for a green recovery. At the heart of schemes announced so far is a radical reorientation of street space in favour of walking and cycling – a goal that is made all the more urgent given the tentative links being made by researchers between air pollution and coronavirus. Milan has announced that 35km (22 miles) of road will be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor is spending €300m (£262m) on a new cycle network. New York, Mexico City, Bogotá and Barcelona are among other cities with schemes ranging from new car-free days to the temporary reclassification of streets as recreation areas.\nAdvertisement\nSo what of the UK? While it is only fair to point out that the country has been a leader on decarbonisation (after doing so much to carbonise the planet in the first place), when it comes to transport we are a laggard. For a mixture of reasons (powerful oil companies; successful car manufacturers; an unhealthy identification, nourished by popular culture, with the car-mad US), we have been painfully slow to take even obvious steps. Hence our illegally dirty air, astronomical rail fares and irrational hostility to cyclists – who are routinely pilloried for the kinds of selfish, careless behaviour that goes unremarked when the culprits are drivers.\nAll is not lost, as March’s draft decarbonisation document showed. This week Boris Johnson – who, when he was London mayor, shrank the capital’s congestion zone – suggested that a “golden age of cycling” could be about to dawn. Having started slowly, British cities are putting in place pandemic measures such as temporary cycle lanes in London, and a Safe Streets Save Lives scheme in Greater Manchester. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government, has told ministers that green policies such as an accelerated transition to electric vehicles would be the strongest basis for an economic recovery.\nThe UK’s chronic overcentralisation remains a brake on progress. Properly accountable and resourced regional government is needed to engineer, both politically and practically, the modal shifts that are needed. But politics is not all top down, and the shift in behaviour during the lockdown, as millions of people have spent far more time on two wheels or feet, is also important. On a recent walk through my London neighbourhood I saw rollerbladers, sunbathers, neighbours playing darts against a gate and a game of badminton between parked cars. It’s almost 40 years since Donald Appleyard showed in his book Livable Streets that less busy roads lead to stronger communities. Could the pandemic see the start of a broader movement to reclaim our town and cities from cars?\n• Susanna Rustin is a Guardian leader writer\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening.\nWith the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared “essential” services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions. To ensure they could do so safely, the organisation did what some commentators long thought impossible and began to transition its employees into working from home.\n“There were a couple of us older ones in the office who said it all sounds too hard, really,” Blazey says. “And then we were reluctant to work from home. My home is my home. I don’t particularly want to do my work from there.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe road to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\nAdvertisement\nAs the country went through a collective tech upgrade, millions of workers like Blazey retreated from office blocks and entire cities emptied out. It was a pattern that would be replicated worldwide. Streets devoid of cars and pavements free of people were so haunting that photographs of cities including New York, Paris and Sydney were shared across social media.\nWork after coronavirus: how will it change when the lockdown is over?\nRead more\nWithin Australia, the scale of this change was captured in data obtained by the Grattan Institute. Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people’s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th.\nThose like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world.\nPlanes, trains and cars\nAlready transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor’s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea – which has been around since the 1980s – as a “game changer” for regions along its route.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLabor’s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, calls high-speed rail a ‘game changer’. Photograph: James Ross/AAP\n“High-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,” King said.\nAs an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for “shovel-ready” projects.\nMarion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years – if not longer – before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSydney’s WestConnex tunnel. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify such projects. Photograph: Jenny Evans/Getty Images\nAdvertisement\n“The thing about fast rail is it plays to our dreams,” Terrill says. “We love fast rail. It’s something people respond to emotionally. It’s all things to all people: it’s going to create jobs, take the pressure off cities, help regions, or serve as stimulus.”\n“When we looked at it, most of the benefits go to business travellers going between Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.”\nTerrill says this applies not only to future projects, but extends to existing ones which should now come under review. With no vaccine expected for at least 18 months – if ever – it is possible social distancing regulations may remain even as restrictions on social movement are lifted. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify many existing projects, including the $18.6bn WestConnex underground roadway and a second airport for Sydney.\n'Our income vanished': Australia's galleries and museums buckle in Covid-19 storm\nRead more\nThese decisions may raise questions about the future of mass transit itself, especially among austerity-minded governments concerned about their debt burdens. Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial.\nThe risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what’s needed is a massive expansion.\n“The virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,” Dovey says. “One of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting. This, in my view, is what makes cities work.\n“If people want to stay two metres apart from each other into the future, that will kill cities.”\nThought of in this way, Covid-19 is the sociological equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack – where a swarm of computers repeatedly attempt to access the same system all at once, eventually overloading it with demand. If at the start of the pandemic the main concern was the ability of health systems to cope, now the worry is that secondary systems like transport will buckle.\nWe should be out there turning streets into walkways. All you need is a bit of authority and paint on the road\nKim Dovey\nThe consequences are profound. If density and walkability combine to make cities vibrant places to live, public transport is the sinew that makes it possible. Cars may have dominated cities over the last century but in the last decade patronage of public transport has slowly grown once more. Should this trend be broken, Dovey says, the result would be “tragic”.\n“Reducing public transport to 30% will kill cities,” he says. “We really need to go the other way.”\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nThese concerns go beyond trains, trams and buses to the “microspatiality” of cities and efforts to green them. The more room provided for cars, the less there is for footpaths. Lifts in high-rises built to handle eight to 10 people become unworkable when they are limited to one or two.\n“Right now a lot of people will avoid public transport for a while, which means they’ll get in their cars,” Dovey says. “And that will produce demand for more roads, as it always does.\n“People still believe building roads can ease congestion but that is not true. All it does is stimulate demand for cars. This is going to set back major moves for cities that have been going on for a long time, particularly in trying to claw back space for usage from cars.”\nA fork in the road\nIn January 2019 the Australian car fleet numbered 19.5m, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With millions now out of work or working from home, many of these vehicles have remained off the road. What comes next depends on what happens when restrictions are eased and those people go back to work – particularly as global oil prices remain low.\nThe cause was simple enough. As whole national economies were put on ice at the start of the pandemic, the world’s oil producers kept pumping even as demand fell off a cliff. When they ran out of storage the mismatch between supply and demand grew so chronic oil producers in Russia found it easier to burn their excess, marking a disaster for efforts to combat climate change.\n“Oil fields are not like wine bottles, where you can put in a cork and return to it later,” Jeff Colgan says. “Shutting an oil field down can damage it, which reduces or even eliminates the field’s future production.”\nColgan is the Richard Holbrooke associate professor of political science at Brown University and expert on the global oil industry, who says low fuel prices will last for some time.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA tram on the near-empty Bourke Street mall in central Melbourne. Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images\nAdvertisement\n“Nothing lasts forever in the oil business but low oil prices are probably here to stay for at least the rest of the year and perhaps much longer,” he says. “Even when consumer demand increases after lockdowns end, there is an awful lot of inventory build-up that will keep prices from rising too quickly.”\nAgainst this global backdrop, Australia – which boasts the highest sulphur content fuel in the OECD and rising road transport emissions – finds itself caught between two competing futures.\nOn the one hand, persistent low oil prices will make petrol cars cheaper to run, frustrating any attempt to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles as part of a transition to a zero-carbon economy.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Electric vehicles are improving all the time. Their take-up comes with anything that pauses the growth of the car fleet.’ Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nThe alternative scenario is exemplified by China. When Australia’s largest trading partner lifted restrictions and moved to reopen its factories early this month, its people stayed home. Should this pattern be repeated the world over, the cumulative fall in demand would destabilise oil-producing economies, while making it harder to decarbonise transport at home.\nSome like John Quiggin lean more to this second scenario. While he acknowledges incentives created in the post-pandemic world may lead to less public transport and more cars on the road, the University of Queensland economist says “most forces are going the other way”. If historically the opposition to working from home by business was a meta-conversation about their ability to trust their workforce, the focus could shift to basic costs as social distancing regulations remain and the capacity of a working office falls.\n“Offices are going to be under pressure to keep a lot of space and the very low-cost way of doing that is to give people a choice about whether they come in or not,” Quiggin says. “Meanwhile, electric vehicles are improving all the time. Their take-up comes with anything that pauses the growth of the car fleet which gives EVs a chance.”\nWhat is true for the average employee will also be true for the boardroom. Even if Australia has avoided the worst of the virus, other countries have not. Many will remain in a state of lockdown for some time, forcing individual countries or regions to become more self-reliant. Freight may continue to move across borders into the future but people will not. Anyone looking to travel for business faces the prospect of a mandatory five- to 14-day quarantine each time a border is crossed. In the end, it will be easier – and cheaper – to do deals by video conference.\nThe same could also be said for Australia’s tourism, education and aviation sectors. Education-related travel services and personal travel services respectively ranked as Australia’s fourth and fifth largest exports in 2018-19. After the pandemic, tour operators, universities and airlines will no longer be able to rely on a steady stream of international travellers and students – a reality that is already forcing a restructure.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA grounded Virgin Australia aircraft at Brisbane airport. Photograph: Darren England/AAP\nAdvertisement\nSince Quiggin became among the first to publicly call time on the airlines in late March, Virgin Australia has fallen into administration. Early on the government described Qantas and Virgin as “too essential to fail”, but it has so for allowed the weaker of the two companies to collapse. What happens next, Quiggin says, should be watched carefully.\n“What happens to the airlines will be a signal for what it plans for the rest of the country,” Quiggin says. “There are three possibilities. One is [Virgin] will bounce back in the way the government hopes. One is it won’t bounce back and they’ll let it fall in a heap. The third is they’ll have to intervene or maybe they’ll be forced to do things they currently do not want to do.”\nPubs pivot to digital: 'We hope that people feel that the world outside is still there'\nRead more\nIt is this that underlines the significance of the moment. In deciding the minutiae of how Australians get around, the country’s political leadership finds itself with enormous power to reshape society. Should they reach into the past to direct the future, the result could be a missed opportunity at best, or a grim new reality. Some projects, after all, lend themselves to the moment. Fixing the national broadband network – a $36bn international embarrassment – may eliminate the daily commute for millions while providing stimulus.\nThe most radical may be even more simple.\n“One of the advantages is that right now the streets are empty of cars and we’re going to need more pedestrian space if we’re going to continue social distancing,” Dovey says. “We should be out there turning streets into walkways.\n“All you need is a bit of authority and paint on the road.

Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been observed since the late 1950s, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world’s leaders.\nAt the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the Montreal protocol, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet’s protective atmospheric layer.\nWhen scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO2 emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), a body of the world’s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nJohn Houghton, right, during his time as director general of the Meteorological Office, with Adam Butler, the minister of state for defence procurement, at the official opening of the London weather radar in 1985. Photograph: PA\nUnfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton.\nAdvertisement\nHoughton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role. Chief executive (formerly director general) of the Met Office since 1983, he won numerous prizes and accolades, including the Chree medal and prize in 1979 and election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1976 to 1978.\nWhile the IPCC’s warnings did not result in the swift remedial action that some hoped for, the body continued to refine and expand its knowledge, producing regular comprehensive assessments and forecasts of the climate crisis. In 2007, the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with the former US vice-president Al Gore, with Houghton among those accepting the award in Oslo on behalf of the hundreds of scientists involved.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHoughton remained as co-chair of the IPCC’s scientific assessment working group until 2002, and in that time also fostered a world-leading research effort at the Met Office and its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. The UK still occupies a place at the top table of global climate science today, with the Hadley Centre operating as one of the world’s top climate research hubs. On 1 May, the IPCC announced it would dedicate a key part of its forthcoming report next year to Houghton’s memory.\nKnighted in 1991, Houghton went on from the Met Office to chair, from 1992 to 1998, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, another landmark institution that had an influence on environmental science and policy before it was closed down in 2011 under the government’s austerity cuts.\nHoughton discovered his interest in science at a young age, while studying at Rhyl grammar school in north Wales. He was born in Dyserth, Denbighshire, to strongly evangelical Christian parents, Miriam (nee Yarwood) and Sidney Houghton, the second of three sons of whom the eldest, David, became a meteorologist and the youngest, Paul, a lecturer in engineering. The family moved to nearby Rhyl when John was two, and a statue of him was erected in the town in 2013.\nHe went on to Jesus College in Oxford – sometimes known as the Welsh college for its strong links with Wales – and completed his BA in 1951 and DPhil in 1955. He soon became fascinated by Russia’s Sputnik missions, which he said “transformed” his thinking as they opened new vistas for atmospheric research through satellites. He developed these interests further as a professor of atmospheric physics at Oxford from 1972 to 1983 and deputy director of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory from 1981 to 1983.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nJohn Houghton with the environment minister Virginia Bottomley and a weather computer, 1989. Photograph: Clive Postlethwaite/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock\nAdvertisement\nThroughout his scientific career, Houghton remained true to his devout evangelical Christian upbringing, and worked on combining the two as president of the John Ray Initiative, which aims to connect the environment, science and Christianity, and as a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion. He said of his Christian faith: “The most important choice I have made is to accept Jesus as my saviour and lord. I was brought up that way, but there was a point when I realised it was an important decision that I had to make.”\nAs the UK takes on the presidency of the UN’s crunch climate conference this year, known as Cop26 and set to take place next spring in Glasgow, after being postponed owing to the coronavirus crisis, Britain’s climate science community will play a key role in providing world leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on rescuing the planet from climate breakdown – an effort that owes a lot to the work Houghton began more than three decades ago at the IPCC and Met Office.\nHoughton married Margaret Broughton in 1962 and they had two children and seven grandchildren. Margaret died of breast cancer in 1986, after which he set up the Margaret Houghton memorial fund, a research unit on medical nursing. In 1988 he married Sheila Thompson. Houghton published his autobiography, In the Eye of the Storm, in 2013, and retired to Aberdovey in west Wales where his final years were clouded by dementia.\n• John Theodore Houghton, atmospheric physicist, born 30 December 1931; died 15 April 2020\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.\nThe speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain’s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain’s future role in this changed world.\nIndeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson’s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground.\nCovid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a “watershed moment for humanity”, and a chance for “a world reset”.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nMinisters have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK’s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain’s strategic posture.\nThe question of the UK’s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, “a flagship for dysfunction” can be set aside until the US elections.\nFor most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder.\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for “a deep dive” into the role of China, adding vaguely: “We cannot have business as usual.” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry.\nThe mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that the Huawei deal will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question.\n“We are all paying the price for Beijing’s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade – and put the rest of the world’s health at risk,” says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It’s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk.\nNick Timothy, Theresa May’s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted “David Cameron’s Operation Kowtow” and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: “Just as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America’s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.”\nEchoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: “It is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi – setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage – is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSoldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.

The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: “We can’t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can’t be dependent on China, but we can’t be without a framework of cooperation with China.”\nMcDonald agrees: “There is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.”\nMiliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. “It is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered – through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.”\nBut that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. “We need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.”\nChina is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now delayed until the middle of next year, is to be a success.\nEven now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. “Build back better” has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages.\nBut there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has also been postponed, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation.\nAbove all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain’s diplomats. He argues that: “Any tension that undermines the existing international architecture – whether it is WTO, WHO, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] – anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets.\nAdvertisement\n“You can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.”\nEconomic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a no-deal Brexit on to a £300bn coronavirus hit to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable.\nRobin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. “If you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival – the survival of businesses and the economy – then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.”\nMiliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated.\nEither way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. “The budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,” Niblett says.\nIn the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between 13% and 34%. Covid’s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing.\nIn this deglobalising world, Johnson’s promise in Greenwich to be “a superhero champion” of free trade looks incongruous. The US – with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal – is in free fall.\nYet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important.\nAt the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened.\nThe army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system.\nAdvertisement\nIn a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests.\nBeatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials “will have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP”.\nThere is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK’s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus.\nBill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently near the bottom of the class, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on “herd immunity” and then abandoning the policy.\nNiblett argues that “Brexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBoris Johnson visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March. The UK’s strong medical research base gives him a platform from which to engage. Photograph: WPA/Getty\n“On global health we will have taken a knock. Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo–US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.”\nAdvertisement\nMiliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be “brutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance”.\nHe sees one cause of optimism. “This may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.”\nThe Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled “health is global”. The paper argued that health should be seen as “an agent for good in foreign policy” so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy.\nThe UK may have been trounced in the election to head the WHO in 2017, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK’s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide.\nGreenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river “in the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London”.\nThe nation’s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth.

Today, after years of irrelevance, the climate science deniers are triumphant. Long after their last, desperate claims had collapsed, when they had traction only on “alt-right” conspiracy sites, a hero of the left turns up and gives them more than they could have dreamed of.\nPlanet of the Humans, whose executive producer and chief promoter is Michael Moore, now has more than 6 million views on YouTube. The film does not deny climate science. But it promotes the discredited myths that deniers have used for years to justify their position. It claims that environmentalism is a self-seeking scam, doing immense harm to the living world while enriching a group of con artists. This has long been the most effective means by which denial – most of which has been funded by the fossil fuel industry – has been spread. Everyone hates a scammer.\nGermany has an unholy new alliance: climate denial and the far right\nBernhard Pötter\nRead more\nAnd yes, there are scammers. There are real issues and real conflicts to be explored in seeking to prevent the collapse of our life support systems. But they are handled so clumsily and incoherently by this film that watching it is like seeing someone start a drunken brawl over a spilled pint, then lamping his friends when they try to restrain him. It stumbles so blindly into toxic issues that Moore, former champion of the underdog, unwittingly aligns himself with white supremacists and the extreme right.\nAdvertisement\nOccasionally, the film lands a punch on the right nose. It is right to attack the burning of trees to make electricity. But when the film’s presenter and director, Jeff Gibbs, claims, “I found only one environmental leader willing to reject biomass and biofuels”, he can’t have been looking very far. Some people have been speaking out against them ever since they became a serious proposition (since 2004 in my case). Almost every environmental leader I know opposes the burning of fresh materials to generate power.\nThere are also some genuine and difficult problems with renewable energy, particularly the mining of the necessary materials. But the film’s attacks on solar and wind power rely on a series of blatant falsehoods. It claims that, in producing electricity from renewables, “You use more fossil fuels to do this than you’re getting benefit from it. You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels in the first place”. This is flat wrong. On average, a solar panel generates 26 units of solar energy for every unit of fossil energy required to build and install it. For wind turbines the ratio is 44 to one.\nPlanet of the Humans also claims that you can’t reduce fossil fuel use through renewable energy: coal is instead being replaced by gas. Well, in the third quarter of 2019, renewables in the UK generated more electricity than coal, oil and gas plants put together. As a result of the switch to renewables in this country, the amount of fossil fuel used for power generation has halved since 2010. By 2025, the government forecasts, roughly half our electricity will come from renewables, while gas burning will drop by a further 40%. To hammer home its point, the film shows footage of a “large terminal to import natural gas from the United States” that “Germany just built”. Germany has no such terminal. The footage was shot in Turkey.\nThere is also a real story to be told about the co-option and capture of some environmental groups by the industries they should hold to account. A remarkable number of large conservation organisations take money from fossil fuel companies. This is a disgrace. But rather than pinning the blame where it lies, Planet of the Humans concentrates its attacks on Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, who takes no money from any of his campaigning work. It’s an almost comic exercise in misdirection, but unfortunately it has horrible, real-world consequences, as McKibben now faces even more threats and attacks than he confronted before.\nOnce again Michael Moore stirs the environmental pot – but conservationists turn up the heat on him\nRead more\nBut this is by no means the worst of it. The film offers only one concrete solution to our predicament: the most toxic of all possible answers. “We really have got to start dealing with the issue of population … without seeing some sort of major die-off in population, there’s no turning back.”\nAdvertisement\nYes, population growth does contribute to the pressures on the natural world. But while the global population is rising by 1% a year, consumption, until the pandemic, was rising at a steady 3%. High consumption is concentrated in countries where population growth is low. Where population growth is highest, consumption tends to be extremely low. Almost all the growth in numbers is in poor countries largely inhabited by black and brown people. When wealthy people, such as Moore and Gibbs, point to this issue without the necessary caveats, they are saying, in effect, “it’s not Us consuming, it’s Them breeding.” It’s not hard to see why the far right loves this film.\nPopulation is where you go when you haven’t thought your argument through. Population is where you go when you don’t have the guts to face the structural, systemic causes of our predicament: inequality, oligarchic power, capitalism. Population is where you go when you want to kick down.\nWe have been here many times before. Dozens of films have spread falsehoods about environmental activists and ripped into green technologies, while letting fossil fuels off the hook. But never before have these attacks come from a famous campaigner for social justice, rubbing our faces in the dirt.\n• George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand. This resonated with so many readers around the world. We promise to update you on the steps we take to hold ourselves accountable at this defining point in our lifetimes. With climate misinformation rife, and never more dangerous than now, the Guardian's accurate, authoritative reporting is vital – and we will not stay quiet.\nYou've read 5 articles in the last six months.

We don't have a paywall because we believe everyone deserves access to factual information, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.\nOur editorial independence means we are free to investigate and challenge inaction by those in power. We will inform our readers about threats to the environment based on scientific facts, not driven by commercial or political interests. And we have made several important changes to our style guide to ensure the language we use accurately reflects the environmental emergency.\nThe Guardian believes that the problems we face on the climate crisis are systemic and that fundamental societal change is needed.

With £5m of funding from the mayor, local authorities are planning a range of measures from extending pavements to creating one-way streets, removing through-traffic from residential neighbourhoods and building extra cycle lanes.\nLast week, mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks as part of a newly formed C40 economic task force. They agreed to coordinate efforts to map out plans to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis.\nMark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. “There is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,” he said.\n“We are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into, which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings … C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.”\nThe statement of principles has so far been signed by mayors representing 33 world cities from Los Angeles to Lisbon, São Paulo to Seoul, Melbourne to Mexico City.\nThe statement warns that the recovery from Covid-19 “should not be a return to ‘business as usual’ – because that is a world on track for 3C or more of overheating.”\nIt also states that immediate action on the climate will “accelerate economic recovery and enhance social equity, through the use of new technologies and the creation of new industries and new jobs”.\nMike Bloomberg, the C40 board president and a former mayor of New York City, said: “This taskforce is committed to helping city leaders as they work on economic recovery in ways that lead us forward into the future, not back into the past. The principles we’ve outlined will guide our efforts to develop a new normal – one that is greener, healthier, and more prosperous for everyone.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Now the acute shock of the Covid-19 pandemic has also taken lives and left many more living in fear, while throwing hundreds of thousands out of paid work, shattering businesses and leaving us facing an unstable new world.\nThe impact of both continues and will ultimately leave scars on our nation. But we can be proud that as our 2020 challenges have mounted we have seen a remarkable and growing willingness across our community to drop old grievances, listen to the science, experts and evidence, and look after each other, including people most at risk, with united purpose.\nAustralian businesses call for climate crisis and virus economic recovery to be tackled together\nRead more\nAnd we should take some confidence that we can meet other significant challenges for our economy, people and the environment, in particular the systemic threat of climate change, if we build on this momentum and common purpose.\nThese crises have demonstrated the importance of trusting expert advice and scientific evidence.

We started physical distancing and quarantining while caseloads were low, rather than waiting until our health system was overrun.\nWe built stronger, albeit still imperfect, safety nets for people without paid work and businesses facing dire circumstances. We gave targeted financial support by lifting the jobseeker payment and providing a wage backstop for hundreds of thousands of people who would have otherwise been thrown out of work.\nWe criticise ourselves and our institutions a lot. That is not without cause and is part of how we get better. But our society and our institutions have been tested this year and have shown great underlying strengths.\nWe are an educated society, with a strong democratic foundation and robust public institutions such as our healthcare system and public service.

At the same time climate change remains an enormous and growing threat to our wellbeing and prosperity.\nIt is frustrating that after decades of trying we still don’t have political consensus on durable energy and climate change policies that look after workers and people experiencing disadvantage, support investment and drive down emissions. Partly as a result, we have an increasingly desperate need to protect lives and livelihoods with greater resilience to the impacts of global heating already locked in.\nBut, as with our emergency responses to the bushfires and Covid-19, we have a solid foundation to establish an effective climate change response that will create a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.\nBodies such as the Australian Climate Roundtable are continuing to bring different groups like ours into forums where we are finding common ground on the path forward. Many actors in our community – businesses, investors, civil society and unions – have consulted with the scientists and experts, and are together advocating for stronger action and coalescing around science-based targets such as reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThat is an arduous ascent, but we also have guides on hand with the expert advice to help us get there. Australian climate scientists are globally recognised; strong public institutions are in place, such as the Climate Change Authority, financial regulators and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to help guide the private sector and community through the transition; and we have considerable policy expertise in the development of effective measures to reduce emissions while supporting trade exposed industries and their employees.

In a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday, the committee said combining the recovery from the lockdown with actions to cut emissions would be beneficial in the short and long term.\n“Actions towards net-zero emissions and to limit the damages from climate change will help rebuild the UK with a stronger economy and increased resilience,” wrote the committee chair, Lord Deben, and the chair of the sub-committee on adaptation, Lady Brown.\nMore measures were needed to help people continue to walk, cycle and work remotely after the lockdown eases, the committee said. Increased cycling and walking would reduce the strain on public transport while keeping down air pollution, which people have become more aware of because of reduced road traffic.\nAirlines and oil giants are on the brink. No government should offer them a lifeline\nGeorge Monbiot\nRead more\nThe advisers also called for retraining programmes to equip people with skills such as installing low-carbon heating, energy and water efficiency, and flood protection for homes.\nThey said rescue packages for carbon-intensive sectors “should be contingent on them taking real and lasting action on climate change”, to avoid locking in high emissions for the future.\nFairness should be a “core principle” of any recovery, they advised. “The crisis has exacerbated existing inequalities and … the response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change,” the chairs wrote.\n“The benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay, or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes. It is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new resilient economy.”\nThe committee’s advice bolsters calls from other experts to “green” the economic recovery. On Tuesday, a group of leading economists, including the Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, set out evidence that government spending on low-carbon and other environmentally beneficial activities would provide a bigger boost to the economy, in both the short and long term, than pursuing a traditional recovery that poured money into fossil fuels and ignored the climate crisis.\nQuick guide\nUK government support for workers and businesses during the coronavirus crisis\nShow\nIncome subsidies\nDirect cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month.

Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.\nOther\nLocal authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.\nMortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nGreen campaigners urged the government to heed the advice. Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Improving people’s lives and saving the climate needs to be central to recovery, not rebuilding the profits of damaging industries. The right post-pandemic investment can push a big, positive, reset button on our carbon-guzzling and unsustainable economy and build a clean, healthy and fair world.”\nRichard George, head of oil for Greenpeace UK, said: “When you have both the economy and the environment on the same side of the scales, the debate is over. The only question now is whether the government will listen to the experts and support a recovery package that protects our jobs, our health and our climate.”\nChris Venables, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said the coronavirus crisis was changing the public’s understanding of what is possible in terms of combating climate change, and changing people’s expectations of the government’s role in improving society.\n“The recovery can change the way we think about public health and the health of the planet, whether that is preferring online connectivity to carbon-intensive travel, or making greater efforts to conserve forests and improve access to green spaces. In response to coronavirus, the government has taken decisive measures. Similar courage can lead us to a healthier world in recovery.”\nIn the letter, the committee reminded the prime minister of Britain’s role on the world stage. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for November but now postponed to next year. Johnson and the Cop26 president, the business secretary Alok Sharma, will be urging other countries to come forward with national plans to curb carbon.\nDeben and Brown said the UK must show leadership by linking the economic recovery and the climate crisis.“Our credibility as an international leader rests on taking action at home,” they said.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

They said the three countries were all failing to cut their emissions in line with the Paris agreement.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nIn response to the objections raised by Brazil, France and Germany, the children said they had been “directly and foreseeably injured” by the greenhouse gas emissions that those governments had allowed to change the climate.\nThey have submitted new scientific research on how the countries are failing in their obligations, and said it would be “futile” to argue their case in separate domestic lawsuits in each country, as that “would not provide the type of far-reaching international relief needed to reverse climate change”.\nAlthough 140 countries, excluding the US, have ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child, only 46 governments have adopted a protocol that allows for this kind of legal action. Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey – are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld.\nAdvertisement\nThere has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint.\nThe lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the Netherlands, in the Urgenda case, in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis.\nIn the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement. The ruling will have implications for other government plans likely to raise emissions, such as road-building schemes.\nMore than 1,300 legal actions have been brought around the world to try to force governments to confront the climate crisis. More than 1,000 are in the US; the highest profile case there, the Juliana case, was dismissed by judges earlier this year. There are similar cases ongoing in 28 countries including Ireland, Australia, Spain and New Zealand.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Even in the most optimistic outlook, 1.2 billion people will fall outside the comfortable “climate niche” in which humans have thrived for at least 6,000 years.\nThe authors of the study said they were “floored” and “blown away” by the findings because they had not expected our species to be so vulnerable.\n“The numbers are flabbergasting. I literally did a double take when I first saw them, ” Tim Lenton, of Exeter University, said. “I’ve previously studied climate tipping points, which are usually considered apocalyptic. But this hit home harder. This puts the threat in very human terms.”\nThere will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years\nInstead of looking at climate change as a problem of physics or economics, the paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines how it affects the human habitat.\nThe vast majority of humanity has always lived in regions where the average annual temperatures are around 6C (43F) to 28C (82F), which is ideal for human health and food production. But this sweet spot is shifting and shrinking as a result of manmade global heating, which drops more people into what the authors describe as “near unliveable” extremes.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHumanity is particularly sensitive because we are concentrated on land – which is warming faster than the oceans – and because most future population growth will be in already hot regions of Africa and Asia. As a result of these demographic factors, the average human will experience a temperature increase of 7.5C when global temperatures reach 3C, which is forecast towards the end of this century.\nAt that level, about 30% of the world’s population would live in extreme heat – defined as an average temperature of 29C (84F). These conditions are extremely rare outside the most scorched parts of the Sahara, but with global heating of 3C they are projected to envelop 1.2 billion people in India, 485 million in Nigeria and more than 100 million in each of Pakistan, Indonesia and Sudan.\nThis would add enormously to migration pressures and pose challenges to food production systems.\nAdvertisement\n“I think it is fair to say that average temperatures over 29C are unliveable. You’d have to move or adapt. But there are limits to adaptation. If you have enough money and energy, you can use air conditioning and fly in food and then you might be OK. But that is not the case for most people,” said one of the lead authors of the study, Prof Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University.\nAn ecologist by training, Scheffer said the study started as a thought-experiment. He had previously studied the climate distribution of rainforests and savanna and wondered what the result would be if he applied the same methodology to humans. “We know that most creatures’ habitats are limited by temperature. For example, penguins are only found in cold water and corals only in warm water. But we did not expect humans to be so sensitive. We think of ourselves as very adaptable because we use clothes, heating and air conditioning. But, in fact, the vast majority of people live – and have always lived – inside a climate niche that is now moving as never before.”\nWe were blown away by the magnitude,” he said. “There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years.”\nThe authors said their findings should spur policymakers to accelerate emission cuts and work together to cope with migration because each degree of warming that can be avoided will save a billion people from falling out of humanity’s climate niche.\n“Clearly we will need a global approach to safeguard our children against the potentially enormous social tensions the projected change could invoke,” another of the authors, Xu Chi of Nanjing University, said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force.\nYet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.\n'It sounded evil': inside the eerie moment California’s deadliest wildfire began\nRead more\nCovid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets.\n“Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great diversity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”.\nThe risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization.\nWe know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability\nWildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the Guardian and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state.\nWildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier.\nParadise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.”\nEven so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG&E transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nParadise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world.\nWe’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the Guardian only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks.\nYet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight.\nOn our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise.\nAlastair Gee and Dani Anguiano are the authors of Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy, available from WW Norton on 5 May.

Covid-19 and climate are bigger than any economic challenge we’ve faced in the last century.”\nAustralia’s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps\nRead more\nWillox is among a band of community leaders and industry groups urging governments to back climate solutions in the pandemic recovery rather than projects that entrench or increase emissions.\nThey include the Investor Agenda, a global group of institutional investors and managers with members responsible for more than $55tn worth of assets. In a statement released on Monday, it said governments should avoid prioritising “risky, short-term emissions intensive projects”, and that accelerating the shift to net-zero emissions could create significant employment and economic growth while improving energy security and clean air.\n“The path we choose in the coming months will have significant ramifications for our global economy and generations to come,” the group, which includes Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said.\nIn Australia, visions for a “clean recovery” or “renewables stimulus” will be the focus of two online industry summits this week. Speakers include the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and energy ministers from four states.\nThe emphasis of the summits differs from that of the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has backed gas, a fossil fuel, as key to driving the recovery after a slump in global oil and gas prices.\nTrouble with gas: the Coalition is betting on the fossil fuel for recovery – but the sums don't add up\nRead more\nJohn Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, which is hosting a summit on Wednesday, said the country needed to tackle the current economic crisis and the climate crisis at the same time or it would “lurch from one major problem to another”.\n“This is Australia’s moment to modernise and grow the economy, create hundreds of thousands of new future-proof jobs and position Australia as a global renewable energy superpower,” Grimes said.\nWillox planned to tell a separate forum hosted by the Clean Energy Council on Tuesday that last summer’s bushfires had been a preview of what lay ahead due to climate change. His speech notes said a successful energy transition must leave no-one behind and extend beyond electricity generation to include heavy industry, transport, agriculture, buildings “and more”.\n“There is immense scope for reform and investment to support that transition, and getting started during the crisis will contribute to faster recovery,” he said.\nHe said the industry group had consulted widely on “the most constructive directions for recovery and transition”. Opportunities raised included: improving energy management in homes and buildings by plugging drafts, modernising equipment and backing local electricity generation and storage; boosting electricity networks by rolling out smart meters and moving edge-of-grid customers on to mini-grids; helping shift heavy industry to run on clean electricity and hydrogen; and supporting large and small energy storage.\nOn transport, Willox said it was an excellent time to prepare cities and major corridors for mass take up of electric vehicles by installing or preparing for charging points at service stations, in public and government car parks, and at apartment blocks.\nHe said governments would have different preferences on whether to use regulatory reform, tax incentives, grants or other approaches. Giving the example of electricity, he said settling on a sound long-term design for market rules and climate policy could do as much to boost investment as direct public financial support.\nA report by the Clean Energy Council, also released on Tuesday, estimated that 50,000 construction and 4,000 ongoing jobs could be created, and $50bn worth of renewable electricity and storage projects built, if governments backed green policies and regulatory reform to “jumpstart” the economy.\nTackling climate change is vital for the strongest economic recovery after coronavirus\nPatrick Suckling\nRead more\nIt said it would require help to overcome policy and grid transmission roadblocks that led to large-scale wind and solar investments falling 50% last year, changes to electricity market rules so the full benefits of energy storage were reflected and support for renewable hydrogen.\nOn a smaller scale, it would mean governments removing barriers for renters, low-income households and community groups installing solar and supporting home batteries by either reducing costs or offering low-interest loans.\nKane Thornton, the Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, said there were hundreds of large-scale wind and solar projects with planning approval that could proceed quickly, create jobs and bring down prices.\nAdvertisement\n“This isn’t about a handout for industry when government is directing scarce taxpayer funding to other essential services and areas,” Thornton said.\n“There is an enormous appetite for private investment in clean energy that can be unlocked through smart regulatory reform, sensible energy policy and investment in the grid and energy storage.”\nThe International Energy Agency last week reported a “staggering” plunge in global demand for coal, oil and gas during the pandemic, with only renewable electricity proving resilient.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Less was known about the global pandemic; the data and scientific research showing how the two global crises are linked was not as clear is it is today. But the connections quickly became obvious to Atkin, founder of the climate newsletter and podcast Heated. “Both are global crises which threaten millions of lives with clear science on how to solve them which governments have been too slow to act on; the same people who promote climate denial are refusing to accept the science of coronavirus, too.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nEmily Atkin, a former reporter at New Republic, launched Heated, a climate-focused newsletter and podcast\n“Coronavirus makes climate change worse, and vice versa,” Atkin says from isolation in her apartment. “We can’t do our research on climate because of it, we’ve had to cancel the UN climate summit for international negotiations.” Meanwhile, Donald Trump has loosened existing emission regulations during the pandemic, yet studies are already finding that death rates are “significantly higher” in areas with worse air pollution levels. The destruction of biodiversity makes pandemics more likely. And just like with the impact of global heating, , the coronavirus is hitting black, brown and poor people the worst.\nThe two things are so connected, Atkin repeats, that it’s stupid to say they’re not.\nRaised in New York and based in Washington DC, Atkin started reporting on the climate in 2013 after graduating in journalism from SUNY (the State University of New York) but three years in she was burnt out. “I was forced to write in this really straight way with no emotion, just fact,” she says of her time spent at the now closed liberal news site ThinkProgress and then a more conservative TV network. “We ran stories which focused on ‘balance’ in a bid not to alienate audiences.” When facts were presented, it was to be done without emotion: the science shows we’ll kill people if we don’t do anything, we’re not doing anything, end report.\nClimate-change deniers were also being given airtime on TV segments she was producing. She recalls being asked to rerecord a voiceover because she sounded “too judgmental” when stating what had been said by an interviewee wasn’t scientifically correct. And, with editors regularly giving science and opinion equal value, all too often Atkin felt she was doing a disservice to her beat.\n“I thought back to my journalism classes and how we were taught the first rule in the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics is to seek truth and report it.” Atkin came to the realisation that when it comes to the climate crisis, showing what is true requires more than facts alone.\n“The truth is full of emotions, money and power,” she says. “It’s about people dying while others profit, the impact on lives and culture and jobs.” Atkin had told the climate story again and again but felt she was making little impact. “It seemed so irresponsible for me to be working as a journalist… without being explicit about what will happen if we don’t lower carbon emissions, and fast.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAnd so in September last year she left her reporting job at New Republic and launched Heated: a climate-focused newsletter which aimed at speaking directly to an ever-growing, but under-served, environmentally-conscious audience. Atkin quickly found launching her own platform didn’t just offer her editorial freedom, but her more emotive and in-depth output was giving her subscribers more confidence to talk all things climate in their daily lives.\n“I’ve had so many emails from readers telling me how before Heated the idea of speaking abut climate change to friends, family and colleagues made them anxious,” says Atkin. “Social science shows the best thing we can do as individuals on climate change is to speak about it, but it’s so controversial in the US that many people felt if difficult questions were asked they wouldn’t be prepared.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA boarded-up bar on the Upper East Side of New York City. Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Getty\nHer paying subscribers have an expectation of regularly delivered content, and when the pandemic worsened she was struggling to write about the relationship between coronavirus and the climate crisis in a coherent and digestible way. “If I do a podcast, I thought, I could work it out as we go along by talking to really smart people,” she says. The moment matched the medium, and the Heated podcast was quickly launched.\nAdvertisement\nShe has interviewed the veteran US environmentalist Bill McKibben, Harvard’s interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment Dr Aaron Bernstein, and a host of her fellow climate journalists. Her response to Planet of the Humans, Michael Moore’s controversial climate documentary (“a bad faith insult to all the work climate and energy scholars, journalists and activists have done in the last ten years”) makes compelling listening.\nThe first episode, however, opens with Atkin offering her own realisation: that living through the coronavirus has changed her thinking on whether individual action on climate, rather than only big business, politicians and the world’s most powerful, has a significant role to play.\n“Every day now I take an individual action to help protect people: staying at home, wearing a mask, sanitising my hands, avoiding my friends and family,” says Atkin. “And that’s not just to protect people physically, but to show everyone around me that I care about this problem too.”\nShare your story\nShare your stories\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

Public pressure on governments has forced swifter action, and communities have proven that they’re willing to make major changes both to help themselves but also for a greater good. Maybe, thinks Atkin, the “we’re all in it together” attitude could help to progress the climate cause too.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPart of an Extinction Rebellion protest in the Hague, Netherlands, last month.

When the newsletter started there was momentum behind a Green New Deal, a host of candidates with different climate policies fighting it out in the democratic primary, and climate change forums being broadcast on network TV.\n“Focus has always been climate change’s number one problem,” says Atkin. “Journalists aren’t willing to cover it properly, people don’t want to to talk about, politicians with vested interests can’t be bothered.” It’s a crisis in prioritisation, and the coronavirus has certainly sapped momentum from the movement.\nThe relative speed at which states have moved on the coronavirus compared to inaction on the long-running climate catastrophe front has also confirmed one of Atkin’s greatest fears: that we live in societies so focused on the short-term that we wait to see the worst happening with our own eyes before we act on it. She isn’t optimistic about that changing any time soon, so that’s where Heated fits into her thinking.\n”I see my responsibility as documenting the short-term effects of climate change more aggressively so people understand, just like coronavirus, climate change is killing people right now,” she says. Some, Atkin says, might think this make her an activist. “But I think it simply makes me someone who cares about human life, which is a basic tenet of journalism.”\nFar from being irresponsible to talk about the climate during the coronavirus crisis, as Atkin puts it: it’s irresponsible not to.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

A court case brought by environmental groups in 2014 and upheld by the supreme court last year forced the government to act to reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020 at the latest. It is climate action under extreme duress.\nAdvertisement\nThere are more than 1,500 climate lawsuits either complete or ongoing in the world, including similar cases in Ireland and Norway, but this is by far the most successful to date. Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, says the Dutch case is the “strongest climate change decision ever issued by a court” and the only one that has forced government policy.\nIt has big implications not only for climate law but also for governments, most of whose climate policies are years behind their ambitious pledges. Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN framework convention on climate change, called it “a test case for very rapid emission reductions” that other nations should watch closely.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe Dutch government has opted for a crash programme, choosing policies that should mean it hits the target in the eight months remaining in 2020. But it didn’t have to be this way.\nMarjan Minnesma, the head of the Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge, says the policies are “a great victory for the rule of law” but points out that Urgenda won its initial case in a district court in The Hague in June 2015.\nThe 2020 target was set at that time and could have been reached gradually, but the government twice tied the case up in appeals, eventually losing in the supreme court in December last year. “It took a long time to step up – five years of not embracing the judgment,” says Matt Siennot, an MP with Democrats 66.\nAn adviser to the Dutch government says the ruling coalition at the time of the original ruling – between the centrist People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the centre-left Labour party – was split on whether to take action and afraid that accepting the decision would open the way to further legal challenges. So they let it languish. “They would say they worked on it, but little was done” he said.\nTheir fears about the courts were ultimately correct: the Netherlands is now a proving ground for environmental lawsuits. A similar case to cap nitrogen pollution was won in 2018, and one of the lawyers from the Urgenda case has partnered with Friends of the Earth to sue Shell, which is headquartered in The Hague.\nAfter the supreme court decision, Minnesma was invited to meet government ministers to present potential carbon reduction policies, and she found their reticence had melted away. “A year ago they wouldn’t have listened to any of that, but suddenly they were all writing it down,” she says.\nWhat she presented was a green wishlist sourced from more than 800 NGOs and institutions – everything from housing associations with ambitious retrofitting strategies to animal rights groups pushing a meat tax and a national meat-free day.\n“We are bringing these ideas from a wide range of Dutch society. We would say: if you want a broad group to accept it, these are the right things. I got the sense they were willing to listen.”\nPaul van der Zanden, a spokesperson for the economics and climate ministry, says: “Finding social support was important for these 2020 climate goals. Urgenda gave a great help in the search for climate measures that citizens can take themselves.”\nMany of the ideas would have been sidelined for years without the push provided by the court decision. Jan Willem Erisman, a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam who works on emissions in agriculture and who contributed proposals to Urgenda, says: “The lawsuits are almost needed for the work to be considered by the government. Otherwise economic concerns get in the way, targets are set, we don’t reach them, and then new targets get set.”\nThe Dutch climate agreement presented in the summer of 2019 was the product of cooperation between industry, the energy sector, unions, environmental groups and citizen groups.\nThe Dutch government believes public and social support are essential for a successful climate policy, and it helps citizens to take climate measures themselves. For example, it provides financial support for lowering households’ energy consumption.\nUltimately, the government settled on the easiest option for the bulk of the emissions reductions. One coal-fired power plant will be closed outright, and two others built in 2016 will run at a minimal level. This alone will save 5-7.5mt of emissions. But several more public-facing measures from the Urgenda list were selected as well. There will be €2bn for renewable energy subsidies, much of it for rooftop solar, and buybacks of inefficient household appliances. Housing associations will receive much of a €300m pot for retrofitting.\n“So far there really hasn’t been much of an attempt to involve people in policies to slow climate change,” says Rebecca Willis, an environmental policy researcher at Lancaster University. “Governments often prioritise policies that don’t impact directly on people’s lives, like switching to renewable energy. But the changes now needed, from switching to electric vehicles and public transport to eating less meat, will affect people’s lives, and it’s vital to work with people to involve them.”\nPerhaps surprisingly, none of the Dutch measures have provoked much of a pushback yet. The Netherlands is no stranger to the climate culture war. The speed limit change from 130km/h to 100km/h – a measure that has already been brought in and is expected to save half a megaton of carbon per year – was mocked as “nonsense” by the far-right MP Geert Wilders and criticised by motoring lobbyists, but the much larger and more expensive parts of the package have passed relatively quietly.\nThe government may have the coronavirus crisis to thank for that. Compared with the spending programmes being rolled out in response to the pandemic, a climate programme that would be huge any other year now seems slight and has not attracted much notice.\nRemco De Boer, an energy analyst, says: “There’s so much else happening. And they’re spending money. KLM [the Dutch airline] has just been rescued [for €4bn].” He says measures such as renewables subsidies and home upgrades also fit with the desire for economic stimulus.\nThe crisis has also provided the government with a bit of wiggle room in delivering the policies. Emissions for 2020 will be much reduced with so much economic activity suspended. Pieter Boot, the head of climate at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, estimates that even a short lockdown could knock more than 5mt off the yearly total.\nBut Minnesma says that even if emissions get a one-time reprieve, the measures need to be permanent. The court verdict will be just as valid next year and every year going forward. “We still have the rule of law,” she says, “and we have shown using the law as an instrument of change is possible.”\n• This article was amended on 4 May 2020.

Net profit was down 62% to $1.19bn.\nA bank statement released on Monday said Westpac recognised climate change was one of the most significant issues that would affect long-term prosperity of the global economy “and our way of life”. It committed the bank to managing its business in alignment with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, including a transition to an economy that has “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nIn a list of principles, the bank said climate change was a financial risk, that addressing it would create opportunities and called for the re-introduction of a carbon price.\nIt promised to lend another $3.5bn to climate solutions over the next three years and ensure its financing of electricity plants supported a path to zero emissions.\n“Westpac’s preferred policy position is that a broad, market-based price on carbon is the most effective, affordable, flexible and equitable means of achieving emissions reductions at the least cost across the economy,” it said.\nOn thermal coal, it said it would support existing customers as it reduces its exposure to the fossil fuel to zero over the next decade. It would continue to offer finance for metallurgical coal, used in steel production, while supporting technology developments to reduce the steel industry’s dependence on it.\nOn oil and gas, it said it would assess their role in the transition to a low carbon economy while providing finance in line with its commitment to the Paris deal.\nBanks boosted new lending to fossil fuel projects last year, figures show\nRead more\nClimate activist group Market Forces said Westpac’s commitment on electricity lending should “squeeze out” new coal power plants and make it near impossible to finance new gas generation. It pointed to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that found meeting the Paris goal of keeping global heating as close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as possible meant energy from gas must fall 25% below 2010 levels by 2030.\nThe group’s executive director, Julien Vincent, said the bank’s stance was a nail in the coffin of thermal coal and a warning to the federal government if it planned to boost fossil fuels on the way out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n“This plan shows it won’t be happening with Westpac’s cooperation,” Vincent said. “Last year, the Commonwealth Bank was the first to commit to be out of thermal coal by 2030 along with all three of our general insurers. Now, anyone trying to operate a coalmine or power station in Australia by the end of this decade will need to do it without Westpac as well.”\nMarket Forces said it hoped the new policy meant Westpac would reverse its recent lending trends, including $5.4bn in loans to coal, oil and gas projects since 2016, far more than the bank made available to renewable energy projects.\nThe activist group found Westpac increased its new investments in fossil fuel projects by 8% in 2018-19 compared with the previous year. The bank said its overall exposure to climate polluting industries, including longstanding investments, fell by 16%.\nInsurance giant Suncorp says it will no longer cover new thermal coal projects\nRead more\nThe Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors with funds under management worth about $2tn, said Westpac’s policy was a positive step that reinforced a global trend among international financiers to strike out or limit coal financing.\nThe group’s chief executive, Emma Herd, said in the past few months some of the world’s biggest funders of coal projects, including Japanese banks Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho, had ruled out directly funding new coal plants. Others, such as HSBC, had tightened existing policies.\nMay House, an economic analysts with the Australian Conservation Foundation, welcomed the announcement and called on financial institutions to ensure their financing and investment portfolios were focused on both rebuilding the economy and addressing climate change and biodiversity loss.\n“For Australia’s big four banks, this does not end at setting an exit date for financing thermal coal, but should extend to ruling out funding any new or expanded oil and gas projects,” she said.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

But this isn’t the first time we have sacrificed our education to flatten a curve for the greater good. We’ve been doing it since 2018 when we decided to forego school classes on Fridays to bring attention to the climate crisis and the exponential curve of fossil fuel emissions that, according to the World Health Organisation, kills seven million people a year.\nAs young people locked in our houses with endless video calls for uni and work, we are worried. Are we the first generation to watch the world go through two exponential crises? One of medical concern, threatening the lives of millions and locking down countries.

It is already vulnerable people who suffer most: low-income families, those in regional and rural areas, First Nations people, young people, women and elderly people. This is also true of climate change. And just like with Covid-19, we all need to play our part in adjusting the new normals of our world, because it will never be the same again.\nAs countries increase their lockdowns and individuals are travelling far less, global emissions are reducing and air quality is increasing.

The state has asked many businesses to stand idle to save lives, firms have turned to the state as their guarantor of survival and workers have risked their lives for us all. When we have faced our toughest test for decades as a nation, it has been essential to pull together.\nYet we are only at the beginning of the need to recognise the mutual dependence between public and private sectors and our collective solidarity.\nThe effects of this pandemic are arbitrary and catastrophic and no business or worker should have to face them alone. This spirit must carry us through not just the continuing “rescue” part of the emergency but into recovery and renewal to build a different economy.\nThe chancellor says he cannot “save every business”, but that should not hide the fact that every business that goes bust because of necessary public health measures represents not just a failure of that business but risks deepening the recession — and impeding recovery.\nThe lesson of past crises is that at the time governments believe that the danger is doing too much, too quickly – but the bigger danger is that they do too little, too slowly. Doing everything we can to protect businesses and workers makes sense for the taxpayer because the fiscal cost of lost businesses, unemployed workers and lost tax revenue outweighs the cost of acting.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nThat is why, for example, Labour has led the argument for reform of the government’s loan system to make it work not just for 25,000 SMEs out of nearly six million as it has so far, but for many, many more. It is good that change is now coming. We have also argued for and welcomed the furlough scheme, though there remain significant gaps for some of the self-employed.\nThis week the government will start to provide a sense of our likely emergence from lockdown. There will be sectors that cannot reopen for months. Take the hospitality sector, with over three million jobs. Twenty-five thousand outlets, including pubs and restaurants, are missing out on the targeted grants to cover their costs.\nThousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of workers. Essential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help.\nThe government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including where necessary an extension of the furlough scheme — with greater flexibility to enable part-time working — and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes.\nThere are also parts of our economy which warrant particular attention. One lesson from this crisis is that our domestic manufacturing base matters far more than has previously been acknowledged.\nThis is an issue of national and economic security, and the government should be willing to step in on the right terms.\nYet just as our mutual dependence means the state owes responsibilities to support the private sector, so those who get state support owe obligations to the taxpayer.\nIf you’re registered in a tax haven and you want support, you should come onshore. If you’re a multinational and plan to pay dividends to shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don’t need them.\nThe public should look back on the support it has given business over this period with pride. That also means ensuring the gains from public support accrue to all of us, and not just the losses. The government should be willing to consider an equity stake in firms — particularly when there is a compelling economic or environmental rationale.\nThe need for public and private to work together with imagination will also be essential as we seek to emerge from what could be the deepest recession for 300 years. During this crisis we have seen thousands of workers redeployed from sectors that have closed. Let’s learn the lesson of what is possible.\nWe know that the climate emergency is a challenge we can simply no longer afford to ignore. Let’s create an army of zero carbon workers, retraining and redeploying those who can’t work into different industries, from home insulation to wind turbine manufacture to tree planting.\nWe also cannot ignore the deep lessons of this crisis about the world of work, including about the role of unions. It is the lowest-paid workers whom we have relied on. We need a new bargain tackling powerlessness and insecurity.\nIn these testing times and beyond, the spirit of common endeavour we have seen in the first phase of this crisis must animate what we do. Together state, business and workers must share the risks and burdens we face. Even out of this emergency, we can and must build a better tomorrow.\nAdvertisement\nEd Miliband is shadow business and energy secretary\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Here are some of the key issues, but this is not even close to being an exhaustive list.\nRenewables are just as bad as fossil fuels?\nAssociate Prof Mark Diesendorf, an energy systems and sustainability expert at the University of New South Wales, tells Guardian Australia the film’s commentary on renewable energy is “out-of-date, superficial, simplistic, misleading and very biased”.\nIt criticises renewable energy – particularly solar and wind – in part because you need varying amounts of materials, energy and metals to make them.\nFor anyone who has thought for more than a minute about what it takes to build that solar panel or those wind turbines, it should be no revelation that some materials and energy are needed. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.\nBut the film leaves the viewer thinking there is no net gain from renewable technologies and does not, for example, look at any cradle-to-grave analysis of the technologies it criticises.\n“The myth that life-cycle energy invested [and carbon emissions] in building renewable energy technologies is comparable with the lifetime energy generation is false,” says Diesendorf.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPlanet of the Humans\nAdvertisement\n“Solar panels generate the energy required to build themselves in one to two years of operation, depending on the type of panel and location and their lifetime is about 20 years; large wind turbines in three to 12 months, depending on size of turbines and location, and their lifetime is 25 to 30 years.”\nIn the film Gibbs says: “I learned that solar panels don’t last forever either.” You would think most people would know that.\nEarly in the film, Gibbs walks with an environment group protesting a plan to put up 21 wind turbines at Lowell Mountain in Vermont, a row that played out in 2011 (another hint at the age of the film).\nWe wanted to ignite a discussion, and that’s happened\nMichael Moore\nAn unnamed campaigner tells Gibbs the power grid needs to run idle when the wind drops and that this causes a “bigger footprint” than just running the grid off fossil fuels.\nGibbs takes the speaker’s word but Diesendorf says this is an old myth disproved by real world examples of power grids running with high penetrations of renewable energy – with and without storage such as batteries and hydro power.\nOld ideas and old footage\nThe pace of change and development in the renewable energy industry is rapid so a film that wants to inform viewers should be as up-to-date as possible.\nAdvertisement\nBut the film is riddled with footage, segments and issues that are a decade or so old.\nGibbs attends the launch of the Chevy Volt, a car launched 10 years ago. He criticises it because it’s recharged from a power grid in Michigan dominated by coal.\nTaking a very old example of an electric car operating in one place should not be the basis for forming a judgment about the role of electric cars in 2020, yet the film does.\nGibbs tours a “football field-sized” solar installation called the Cedar Street solar array in Lansing, Michigan. An energy boss says to camera that the panels have an efficiency of a “little less than 8%” and that the array could power only about 10 city homes a year.\nWhat the film doesn’t say is that the array was installed as a pilot project in 2008.\nOne energy writer to have looked closely at many of the claims in the film is Australian Ketan Joshi who says looking at a solar array from 12 years ago is “an absolute eternity in solar development years”.\nPlanet of the Humans review – contrarian eco-doc from the Michael Moore stable\n4 out of 5 stars.\nRead more\nDiesendorf says panels with an 8% efficiency “were on the market several decades ago” and now most commercial panels have an efficiency above 20%.\nWhat’s happened to the cost of solar panels since 2008? Analysts Wood Mackenzie say they fell about 90% between 2010 and 2019.\nBiomass\nAdvertisement\nThe film spends time looking at biomass energy or, more specifically, one subset of biomass technology that is essentially burning trees and woodchips.\nGibbs has been a long-time biomass critic (an old article of his includes a photograph taken while filming footage that appears in the film suggesting that a scene showing clear-felled trees is at least 10 years old).\nI wrote the producer and director to set the record straight, and never heard back from them\nBill McKibben\nBurning trees for energy is very problematic but there are reasons why under some circumstances it is not as bad as burning fossil fuels from a greenhouse gas perspective.\nOne reason is part of climate change 101. Burning fossil fuels liberates carbon atoms that were removed from the Earth’s active carbon cycle millions of years ago. Burning trees moves CO2 back into the biosphere that was sequestered only in recent decades.\nTo an uninformed viewer, the film might look to be getting some purchase when it shows high-profile environmentalists – namely the author and activist Bill McKibben – supporting burning wood.\nMcKibben founded his 350.org climate group at Middlebury College, and the film has footage of him at an opening of a biomass gasification plant there, saying technology like that should be everywhere.\nThat footage was from 2009 and as McKibben has pointed out since the film was released, he very publicly denounced the idea of burning wood for energy in 2016. The film did not make this clear.\nBig Oil is using the coronavirus pandemic to push through the Keystone XL pipeline\nBill McKibben\nRead more\nMcKibben says he heard about the plans for the documentary last year: “I wrote the producer and director to set the record straight, and never heard back from them. That seems like bad journalism, and bad faith.”\nGibbs says he did not get McKibben’s communication and even if he had he would not have changed the film.\nThat aside, Diesendorf says the film’s treatment of bioenergy is simplistic because while some methods, such as ethanol from corn, are environmentally damaging, ethanol from waste starch is not.\nHe says the film creates a false impression that bioenergy as expected to have a large contribution to energy needs in the future. “The truth is that some see it playing a minor role while almost all the others reject it entirely. Hardly anyone sees it as playing an important role.”\n‘Devoid of solutions’\nPlanet of the Humans is a film that is almost entirely devoid of solutions to the existential crisis that its producers say they are deeply concerned about.\nAdvertisement\nIt rightly raises questions about rampant consumption and the planet’s dwindling ecosystems. As some of the examples also show, the film is long out-of-date and there’s no evidence that attempts were made to revise its content or its premise as new information became available and, presumably, the film sat idle in multiple parts for many years.\nGibbs, Moore and fellow producer Ozzie Zehner, who is featured prominently, have defended the documentary.\nGibbs says they had “gone to great lengths” to talk to wind and solar experts.\nSign up to our Film Today email\nRead more\n“We need our environmental leaders, but we are in the wrong story,” he says in an interview with the Hill.\n“We are asking questions about what we say is going to save the world, and it should be permitted to have discussions among people who believe in climate change – and know the environment is in trouble – about what’s going to work and what’s not going to work.\n“That was our intent – to trigger a discussion and raise a lot of questions, but we don’t have all the answers.”\nMoore adds: “We wanted to ignite a discussion, and that’s happened.”\nHe’s certainly right about that.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

There were no “insurmountable reasons” why the grid could not take even higher levels of renewables, as it will need to for Australia to meet the Paris agreement goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions.\nAustralia's electricity grid could run with 75% renewables, market operator says\nRead more\nThe minister in charge of both energy and cutting emissions, Angus Taylor, chose a different emphasis.\nIn a statement issued as the study was released, Taylor said it had highlighted the challenges of increased amounts of solar and wind given the system needed continuous inertia – support from constantly running “synchronous generation” – to ensure grid stability. He suggested that inertia could come from gas-fired power.\nThe market operator’s report does not mention gas generation, but the fossil fuel – often described as having half the emissions of coal, though recent studies have suggested it could be much more – is clearly on Taylor’s mind. A few days earlier he had given interviews to Nine newspapers to support the idea of a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic, suggesting it may be a focus of future economic stimulus measures.\nAdvertisement\nThis is not new terrain for the government. It followed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in January claiming there was “no credible transition plan” for Australia that did not involve greater use of gas, and requiring New South Wales to promise to try to substantially boost the amount of gas available as part of a $2bn energy deal.\nBut with a climate transition plan yet to materialise, analysts and investors say Taylor’s push suggests the government may lock in long-term support for the fossil fuel without explaining what it will mean for emissions, and despite increasing evidence there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives.\nGas demand dives during Covid-19 crisis\nThe outlook for gas has changed significantly since Morrison gave a speech on energy to the National Press Club three months ago.\nAs Guardian Australia has reported, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia crashed by nearly two-thirds, prompting the industry to shelve decisions on tens of billions of dollars worth of proposed investments in export projects. Consultancy EnergyQuest has projected a 40% fall in revenue from the $50bn LNG industry, which has driven most of the increase in national emissions in recent years.\nWhile most industries have been affected by the pandemic, gas has been harder hit than renewable energy. The International Energy Agency this week reported that clean electricity was holding up through the worst global energy shock in 70 years, but demand for gas was down 5% and coal 8%.\nCost plays a major part in this. Analysts at BloombergNEF found solar and wind are now the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation for at least two-thirds of the global population, Australia included.\nAustralia listened to the experts on coronavirus. It's time we heard them on climate change\nLenore Taylor\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, Australia’s biggest oil and gas companies, Woodside Petroleum and Santos, are under siege from shareholders concerned about the financial risk of them backing long-term investments at odds with a zero emissions world. On Thursday, more than 50% of Woodside investors supported a non-binding resolution from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that the company should be setting targets to not only cut its own emissions, but those that result from the gas it sells to be burned in Asia. A similar motion at Santos’s annual general meeting won 43%.\nBoth Woodside and Santos have resisted the push, and argued that gas is a “clean” fuel and part of the climate solution. Like Taylor, they claim Australian gas exports are an environmental good as they reduce coal in Asia. Neither the government nor industry have provided evidence to back this up, and officials have acknowledged the competition in Japan – still Australia’s biggest gas market – is increasingly with zero emissions nuclear and renewable generation.\nAndrew Grant, head of oil, gas and mining with London-based financial thinktank Carbon Tracker, says the global view of gas has flipped from it being seen as a cleaner fuel than coal, to it being the second-least desirable source of electricity. He points to analysis by the International Energy Agency that found global gas-fired power generation must begin to decline later this decade under a sustainable development scenario. “Better than coal is not exactly a ringing endorsement,” Grant says.\nThe Paris deal’s implicit goal of zero emissions by mid-century has been acknowledged by Woodside and Santos’s European counterparts, particularly BP and Dutch Royal Shell. Shell, for example, has targets to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050, and to reduce the “scope 3” emissions released by customers when using its products by two-thirds by moving into clean energy.\nIn contrast, Woodside’s chief executive, Peter Coleman, dismissed the likelihood of billion-dollar investments in renewable energy and the chairman, Richard Goyder, said the company primarily saw itself as “a gas company, with some assets in oil”.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nScott Morrison and Angus Taylor believe there is ‘no credible transition plan’ for Australia that does not involve greater use of gas. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\nAdvertisement\nArguments over the future of gas are complicated to some extent by the different ways in which the fuel is used.\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nIn Australia, there are three main uses – for power generation, as a feedstock and source of heat in industrial processes, and for heating and cooking by households and businesses. All have been hit by skyrocketing gas bills since an LNG export hub opened at Gladstone in Queensland mid-last decade, linking local prices to those in Asia.\nThe government has been focused on lowering prices to help local users, mostly by pressuring states and territories to increase supply. New gas onshore fields were being proposed and considered when the pandemic hit, sending the global oil and gas prices tumbling.\nWhile the fall has offered welcome cost relief for gas users, the government has a different view to some analysts and agencies on the extent to which gas is likely to remain cost-competitive and vital to Australia’s needs.\nIn a written response, Taylor did not answer directly a question about the role he believes gas will play as a transition fuel, or mention emissions reduction or climate change, but emphasised the “essential” role the fuel plays in energy reliability.\n“[It] could be even more important through a gas-fired recovery,” he said, reinforcing an earlier call for new “fast-start” generators that run only when required.\nBut there is little evidence that the Australian electricity grid will need more gas power. Last year, it provided about 9% of generation. The market operator assessment suggested this could fall to near zero in the second half of this decade before returning in a much smaller amount – less than a third of what it is now – in the 2030s if the grid was to run at lowest cost.\nCovid-19 crisis will wipe out demand for fossil fuels, says IEA\nRead more\nIn terms of the flexibility in the system needed to “firm up” variable solar and wind energy, the market operator listed pumped hydro, batteries and “demand-side participation” – schemes that offer energy users incentives to scale down consumption when required – as likely sources. On gas, it said only that it may also play a greater role if prices fall. It is an option, but not the only one.\nSimon Holmes à Court, senior advisor to the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, says the services needed for a secure power grid are increasingly available from sources other than gas, including government-backed large batteries and potentially through adjustments at wind or additions at solar farms.\nTony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, believes fast-start gas is likely to have a role in the power grid but says it should live or die on its own merits, and not be boosted by the government through its $1bn underwriting program for new energy projects or any other support.\nAdvertisement\nHe is just as dismissive of suggestions the government may support new long-distance gas pipelines, which have previously been touted by Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals executive now heading the federal government’s Covid-19 Coordination Commission.\nIt is broadly accepted gas could be replaced by cheaper electricity in heating and cooking, but is likely to have a longer role in heavy industry and manufacturing. Wood says potential replacements such as green hydrogen are not affordable today, though that could change sooner than expected not long ago, possibly within the next decade.\nIn all its uses, he says, the role of gas is “heading in the same direction”, just on different timeframes, and it should not be the role of government to boost it.\n“If Angus is right, if he was an all-seeing and all-knowing god who knows gas is part of the answer, then that would be different,” Wood says. “But I don’t think he is.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It's time we heard them on climate change","paragraph":"W\ne’re already being swamped with ideas about “reforms” needed to recover from the pandemic crisis. But the word reform is like gift wrap – a handy cover for any offering, thought-through or otherwise.\nPerhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments “must” do to advance an author’s previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world.\nImagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a “war”.\nThink, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABC’s 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them “in” or “out”, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice – even if that policy hasn’t yet been outlined.\nAustralia's electricity grid could run with 75% renewables, market operator says\nRead more\nNow consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia.\nI concede that’s quite a leap given the past decade of mind-numbing debate, during which experts have struggled to get a look in. But in the background, some have been giving it a shot.\nFor six years now leading business, environmental, investor, union, farming and social welfare groups have been trying, largely in vain, to create a space for a sensible discussion about global heating, and to give Australian politicians a way to retreat from the self-defeating culture war that has scuppered all attempts at policy.\nThey wouldn’t put it this way, but in effect the environmentalists, desperate for Australia to make some meaningful move towards reducing emissions, and the business groups, desperate for some kind of investment certainty, have been trying to save Australia’s politicians from themselves.\nThe starting point for the Australian Climate Roundtable’s deliberations is that Australia needs to reach net zero emissions, and that delaying action just increases the cost of reaching that goal. Unremarkable propositions in any fact-based forum, but in some Coalition circles, still close to heresy.\nNow the roundtable, including its business members, argues that this post-corona reconstruction is a chance to speed up decarbonising the economy.\nCovid-19 crisis will wipe out demand for fossil fuels, says IEA\nRead more\nThe Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, argued in an opinion piece that the post-corona discussion should divest itself of “ideological constraints”.\n“In resuscitating our economy, we can tackle some of our most vexed problems. Every dollar we invest in energy should be a dollar towards a lower carbon economy and lower energy bills,” she wrote.\nAnd expert evidence about what might be possible has been flooding in by the day.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator this week released its long awaited “renewable integration study”, which found Australia could accommodate levels of up to 75% “instant” penetration of wind and solar in its main grid by 2025 – that we have the know-how, but need to update market and regulatory settings.\nAdvertisement\nThink about that next time someone starts burbling on about the impossibility of a renewable-dependent grid coping “when the wind don’t blow and the sun don’t shine”. Less than a year after an election in which Bill Shorten’s target of 45% renewables by 2030 was attacked for being “unachievable” and “economy wrecking”, the expert market operator says 75% is technically achievable – and in just five years time.\nAnd then there was the advice from the International Energy Agency this week that renewable electricity will be the only energy source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years, triggered by the pandemic.\nThe Morrison government is supposed to be working on a “roadmap” towards some kind of long-term emissions reduction policy, understandably delayed while it deals with the pandemic.\nIt could draw on the work of a bunch of expert groups who have already had a go – the latest Climateworks report released earlier this month found that net zero emissions by 2035 is possible in Australia, using technologies that are mostly already mature and available. The CSIRO’s roadmap released last year found there was no trade-off between economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions, and in fact strong action could lead to GDP growth, an increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050.\nInvestors call on Australia's largest oil and gas company to set greenhouse targets\nRead more\nBut then, apparently pre-empting his own policy, and contradicting his own government’s claim to be “technology neutral”, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has spent the week calling for a “gas-fired recovery”, variously advocating more gas-peaking plants, more long-term gas supply for manufacturers and more onshore gas production. The details of what he’s advocating remain opaque, but as the Grattan Institute’s energy expert Tony Wood points out, renewed suggestions of government intervention are only likely to deter investment, presumably the opposite of what Taylor is seeking.\nIf there’s a coherent policy in there somewhere, it really is time for the government to unwrap it. The experts have been waiting for years, and it turns out that listening to them is a good idea.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This administration has cleared out science and scientists across all departments. America's reputation as a competent global leader is in peril. Truth is being chased away.

The water savings achieved by the upgrades are meant to be shared between the farmer and the environment, as a win-win.\nBut this study argues that the schemes often amount to “robbing Peter to pay Paul” because they reduce flows into the environment that were occurring in the past through groundwater systems and are leading to greater water extractions by those who get the subsidies.\nAdvertisement\nThe efficiency programs under the Murray Darling Basin plan have long been controversial because they cost roughly three times as much as buying back water directly from from farmers. But direct buybacks are highly contentious in rural communities because of their economic impact.\nProf Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford School at ANU told a senate committee last year that the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers.\nNow this report casts doubt about whether they are actually retrieving water at all.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“Combined with documented concerns around measurement of water and compliance, this raises serious doubts about the true extent to which environmental flows are increasing at a catchment and basin level, as a consequence of the subsidised upgrades,” the authors said.\nLead author and resource economist Prof Sarah Wheeler from the University of Adelaide said: “Our analysis over the past decade found that irrigators who received infrastructure grants actually increased their water extraction volumes by 21 to 28%, compared to irrigators who received no subsidies.”\nThe subsidies aim to help irrigators upgrade their infrastructure technology to save water and return some savings to the environment, in a bid to increase stream flows and ultimately reinstate a sustainable level of extraction in the Murray Darling Basin.\nProf Richard Kingsford, director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW Sydney, said the implementation of some government programs seemed to have the opposite effect of what they had intended.\n“The ‘buyback’ of irrigation water has put water back into the rivers, but our research found the subsidised infrastructure program could be ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ by enabling more water extractions than water recovered through the efficiency program,” Kingsford said.\nThe study also found that half of all irrigators surveyed agreed that the taxpayer-funded program for the irrigation infrastructure was ‘wasteful and inefficient’.\nThe study found that the program favoured corporate agriculture, in terms of subsidy amount per entity more than family farms.\nPlay Video\n0:56\nLocals celebrate as waters of Murray-Darling rivers join for first time in two years – video\nAdvertisement\nThe increase water extraction occurred because of changes in crop types, increases in irrigated areas and greater use of surface water entitlements [water that is captured on farm rather than being allowed to flow into the river system],” Grafton said.\nEnvironmental Defenders Office special counsel Emma Carmody said: “There are a range of regulatory and governance issues which could result in the increased taking of water from some rivers and aquifers in the MDB, beyond specified limits.”\nThese include illegal extractions, increased floodplain harvesting, groundwater substitution and problems with ‘sustainable diversion limit’ compliance tools in some catchments.\nKingsford warned that if water consumption is not being controlled as required by the basin plan, the health of rivers and groundwater systems in the Murray-Darling Basin will continue to degrade, without even accounting for the current and future threat of climate change.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The vote follows 43% support for a similar motion among shareholders of the country’s second biggest oil and gas company, Santos, earlier this month.\nNeither vote was binding – the motions were not formally put after earlier votes to change the companies’ constitutions to allow advisory resolutions failed – but the strength of support for greater climate action among shareholders surprised even activists.\nDan Gocher, from shareholder activist group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the support for its motion from 50.2% of Woodside shareholders was striking given the company’s board had opposed it.\n“This is a breakthrough moment for investor action on climate change in Australia,” he said.\n“Until Woodside explains how its business will align with the goals of the Paris agreement, the company will be in open conflict with the majority of its shareholders. This is an untenable position for the company.”\nAlmost half of all shareholders at Santos AGM back stronger emissions target\nRead more\nA second resolution calling on Woodside to review its links to groups that lobby on behalf of fossil fuel companies, such as the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, received 42.7% support from voting shareholders. Both motions were supported by several large proxy advisers, including ACSI, Glass Lewis, ISS, PIRC and Regnan.\nWoodside’s chief executive, Peter Coleman, said the company acknowledged investor and community interest in “the challenge of climate change”. The company says it aims to reach net zero emissions for its own operations by 2050 but argues gas, as a fossil fuel that releases less when burned than coal, is a solution to global heating.\n“We’ll continue this conversation as our business plays its role in supplying reliable energy while supporting progress towards a lower carbon world,” Coleman told the meeting, which was held online due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nFuelling the climate crisis: why LNG is no miracle cure for Australia’s coal addiction\nRead more\nColeman and Woodside’s chairman, Richard Goyder, were asked if the company had evidence to support its claim its gas was reducing global emissions by displacing coal use in Asia. Coleman said the company did not collect that information from customers, and pointed to a study that compared the life-cycle emissions from different forms of energy.\nEmma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said Australian oil and gas companies were clearly at risk of falling behind their European counterparts, such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, in planning to diversify their business and set robust targets in line with the Paris agreement.\n“Investors expect the companies they invest in to address their contribution to rising global emissions,” she said. “It is incumbent now on Woodside to work constructively with the investors to develop real plans to transition to a net zero emissions company by 2050.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand. This resonated with so many readers around the world. We promise to update you on the steps we take to hold ourselves accountable at this defining point in our lifetimes.

All I’m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers. Is this legal?\nNo. But that hasn’t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU’s “denied boarding” rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.\nThe problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.\nRefunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.\nNote: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU – for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.\nIn the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do?\nTaking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.\nCoby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:\nI understand that my flight [fight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. You are reminded that the refund must be made within seven days. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.\nIf the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use Alternative Dispute Resolution.\nIf your flight cost more than £100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.\nMy flight operated as scheduled but I was unable to go on it. What then?\nThe fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.\nMiles Brignall\nWas this helpful?\nAir France, which has obtained €7bn in loans and loan guarantees from the French government, and Lufthansa, currently negotiating a €9bn rescue package with Berlin, top the charts in the airline bailout tracker compiled by Carbon Market Watch, Greenpeace, and Transport & Environment.\nAdvertisement\nEuropean governments have formally agreed €11.5bn in financial aid for airlines , including a £600m loan from the UK Treasury and Bank of England for EasyJet. A further €14.6bn is under discussion, including £500m Richard Branson is seeking from the British government to aid Virgin Atlantic.\nThe industry is grappling with a massive fall in demand: air travel is at a near standstill, with no end in sight, owing to pandemic-related travel restrictions.\nSome governments are seeking to attach strings to rescue plans. France’s minister for ecological transition, Élisabeth Borne, insisted Air France was not getting “a blank cheque”. The government has set “ecological commitments”, she said, including a 50% reduction in carbon emissions on domestic flights by 2024, as well as investing in more fuel-efficient planes.\nAustria’s prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, announced his government would not help Lufthansa’s Austrian Airways operation without getting something in return, such as securing jobs in his country; while the vice-chancellor, Werner Kogler, has said he would “assume” a rescue would only happen with green conditions.\nAdvertisement\nCampaigners claim none of the green strings agreed so far are binding, also pointing out that France has not set conditions on Air France’s non-domestic flights, which account for the majority of its emissions. “France’s green requests are a first but we had non-binding commitments for years and airline pollution ballooned,” said Andrew Murphy at Transport & Environment. “Marginally more efficient planes won’t put a dent in emissions if airlines still burn fossil fuels that they buy tax-free.”\nThe data emerged after a majority of European Union members called for a relaxation of air-passenger rights. At a virtual meeting of EU transport ministers on Wednesday evening, Germany, Spain and Romania added their voices to a statement signed by a dozen countries earlier in the day calling for an urgent change to EU rules, so airlines can reimburse cancelled tickets with vouchers, rather than cash.\nThe member states argued that the requirement of the 2004 EU regulation to reimburse cancelled flights in cash is adding to airlines’ cash-flow problems.\nShare your story\nShare your stories\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

During the meeting, Shapps reassured the CEO he wanted the Department for Transport to be pro-aviation.\nIn a separate meeting a month earlier with the chief executive of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, Shapps also stated that he wanted to reorient the transport department to be “more proactive in promoting aviation”.\nThe easyJet boss used his meeting to criticise the Netherlands’ plans to levy green taxes on airlines, while Shapps “agreed this was not a way forward”.\nEnvironmental taxes on aviation to cut greenhouse gas emissions could involve a tax on departing passengers, a fuel tax, or making airlines pay for their emissions, all measures discussed in EU institutions.\nQuick guide\nUK government support for workers and businesses during the coronavirus crisis\nShow\nIncome subsidies\nDirect cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month. There are similar wage subsidies for employees.\nLoan guarantees for business\nGovernment to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.\nBusiness rates\nTaxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.\nCash grants\nBritain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.\nBenefits\nGovernment to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.\nSick pay\nStatutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.\nOther\nLocal authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.\nMortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nBut Lundgren said his company would instead be setting up its own sustainability targets, which would involve “gold standard” carbon offsetting, and that EasyJet was involved in the research and development of electric flights. Shapps said the government was committed to investing in electric flights.\nMinutes of the meetings with Lundgren reveal little talk bout any imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, or aviation’s contribution to the government’s new, legally binding target to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050.\nEmissions from aviation reached record levels last year, and in the past five years have risen by 26%; the sector is responsible for 12 percent of CO2 emissions from all transport sources.\nThis month, with EasyJet flights hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Lundgren asked for and was given a £600m government bailout. The failure to attach any environmental conditions to the loan was a missed opportunity, campaigners say.\nFiona Nicholls, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “Carbon offsetting will not clean up aviation’s carbon emissions, just create the illusion it does. EasyJet is peddling snake oil and it’s shocking that the secretary of state seems so willing to buy it.\n“A green levy on frequent flyers offers the UK a fair more effective way of tackling the sector’s huge impact on our planet. Rather than dismissing the case out of hand, Grant Shapps needs to look again and take this moment to promote a measure that will genuinely have an impact on the climate emergency.”\nThe loan to EasyJet was part of state financial support worth €26bn, either sought, or received, by airlines since the pandemic spread across Europe. None of the bailouts had environmental conditions attached.\nA spokesperson for EasyJet said: “We recognise we have a responsibility to minimise the impact of our flights and so are focused on both operating efficiently now, and on the development of electric aircraft in the future. Since the technological solution is not yet available, in the interim we offset the carbon emissions from the fuel used for all of our flights on behalf of all of our customers.\nQuick guide\nWhat zero emissions in 2050 would mean for the UK\nShow\nThe Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:\n• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.\n• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.\n• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\n• Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.\n• A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes.\n• 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.\n• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.\nWas this helpful?\n“We have always said that taxing passengers is not the right approach, as this provides no incentives for airlines to improve the carbon efficiency of their flying, it simply acts as a revenue raiser for governments. The way for aviation to address climate change is to invest in new technology; a tax will simply reduce the funds available to airlines for investment, while only having a very marginal effect on emissions.”\nA separate meeting on 20 August last year with Holland-Kaye came as Heathrow’s expansion was under increasing scrutiny following the net-zero emissions target adopted by the British government that summer.\nShapps told the Heathrow CEO that the national policy statement containing airport expansion plans was still government policy, “subject to future confirmation that it remained value for money”.\nIn the past Shapps has been a vociferous supporter of Heathrow expansion, and he admitted to Holland-Kaye that he felt a “personal conflict of interest” discussing the matter, given his previous statements.\nSince their meeting, Heathrow’s expansion has been thrown into doubt after the appeal court ruled in February that the government’s airline national policy statement was illegal, because ministers had not adequately taken into account the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis when drawing it up. Heathrow Airport is appealing against the judgment in the supreme court.\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Aviation contributes around £14bn to the economy and creates half a million jobs. It is only right that we champion this sector, while continuing our work to make UK aviation the cleanest and greenest in the world.”\n“The sector must play its part in reaching the UK’s net zero by 2050 target. That’s why we are working with industry to develop new technologies, fuels to cut emissions and are taking a leading role driving international action for the sector.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Only renewables are holding up during the previously unheard of slump in electricity use.”\nRenewable energy is expected to grow by 5% this year, to make up almost 30% of the world’s shrinking demand for electricity. The growth of renewables despite a global crisis could spur fossil fuel companies towards their goals to generate more clean energy, according to Birol, but governments should also include clean energy at the heart of economic stimulus packages to ensure a green recovery.\n“It is still too early to determine the longer-term impacts,” said Birol. “But the energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe impact of the coronavirus has triggered a crisis for fossil fuel commodities, including the collapse of oil market prices, which turned negative for the first time in the US earlier this month.\nGlobal efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 have led to severe restrictions on travel and the global economy that will cause the biggest drop in global oil demand in 25 years.\nDemand for gas is expected to fall by 5%, after a decade of uninterrupted growth. It is the steepest drop since gas became widely used as an energy source in the second half of the previous century.\nCoal demand is forecast to fall by 8% compared with 2019, its largest decline since the end of the second world war.\nQ&A\nWhich countries contribute most to the climate crisis?\nShow\nChina produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.\nWas this helpful?\nThe Paris-based energy authority used data from every country and across each energy sector to analyse the impact of the pandemic on the global system.\nIt found that global energy demand was likely to plummet by 6% this year, the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India – the world’s third largest energy consumer – or the combined energy demand of France, Germany, Italy and the UK.\nThe impact of the pandemic on energy use will be more keenly felt in advanced economies where demand is expected to fall by 11% across the EU and 9% across the US.\nThe collapse of fossil fuel demand could lead global emissions to fall by 8% compared with 2019, a drop six times larger than the record fall after the financial crisis in 2009 to lows not seen in the past decade.\nThe 3bn tonne drop in carbon dioxide emissions surpasses data commissioned by the Guardian this month that predicted a fall or 2.5 bn tonnes this year, greater than the drop triggered by every financial crash since the second world war combined.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It was then fed to the Daily Telegraph which published a story prominently.\nThe NSW police interviewed Moore and obtained documents from the council but did not have jurisdiction to obtain documents from the minister’s office in Canberra. A subsequent investigation by the Australian federal police was dropped.\nTaylor has told parliament the document provided to the Telegraph was accessed directly from the council’s website on either 6 or 9 September and printed out.\nOn 25 October, Taylor said: “On 9 September, my office, in preparing a reply to a letter from the City of Sydney lord mayor, accessed a report on the City of Sydney website. The details in that report were the basis of my letter to the lord mayor,” he said.\n“What is clear now, is that the numbers in that document were not correct. I reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the document in question: however, I will be writing to the lord mayor to offer my apologies.”\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nFuller revealed they had reviewed IP addresses of visits to the 2017-18 annual report and there were no downloads from the minister’s office on the dates Taylor has specified.\nTaylor has repeatedly insisted that the false document he used to wrongly attack Moore for her travel-related emissions was from the council’s own website.\nHowever Fuller’s answers, published on 22 April by the NSW parliament, raise more questions about the origin of the document and raise the possibility that they were downloaded by a third party and sent to the minister’s office.\nAdvertisement\nTaylor has refused to release internal emails and one external email sent from a third party, under freedom of information laws, despite requests from Guardian Australia and the Nine newspapers.\nFuller said his investigations had revealed there was no downloads from IP addresses at Taylor’s office on either 6 or 9 September 2019, the two dates Taylor has nominated in parliament as the date the report was accessed.\nFuller also revealed the first date the police found that the document was accessed by Taylor’s office was 29 September 2019 – the date of Taylor’s letter to Clover Moore.\nThis raises the question of where the document provided to the Telegraph came from.\nA NSW government information request to the City of Sydney by Guardian Australia earlier this year revealed 14 computers accessed the 2017-18 annual report on the website on the 6 and 9 September.\n“There are 14 IP addresses associated with 38 line entries in the logs requesting downloads of the 2017/18 annual report statutory returns, either PDF or Word, for the two dates. I understand that some of the entries indicate unsuccessful downloads,” the council said.\n“I used an IP address look-up for each address. Two led to a major city council in another state (not Canberra). All the others, as I understood the information, led to an internet provider such as Telstra,” the council officer said.\nThe city was unable to provide further details due to privacy laws.\nPolice are able to request details of the owners of IP addresses from internet service providers such as Telstra. Major organisations such as the federal parliament usually run their own internet service provider.\nLast year Taylor released a report compiled by his department which showed different computer operating systems produced slightly different formats of the report, but has not been able to again locate the version of the report he said was accessed on either the 6 or 9 September.\nAngus Taylor makes distinction between 'downloading' and 'accessing' document in Clover Moore attack\nRead more\nA spokesman for Taylor pointed to evidence given by officials in Taylor’s department of Environment and Energy to Senate Estimates. The officials said an investigation by the departmental IT team showed the Minister’s office did access the City of Sydney’s website on 9 September.\n“The Department has no records of PDF or Word file documents being downloaded from that visit.

Three of these occurred on Easter Sunday and brought damaging winds reaching 190mph. These left one person dead and another injured, as well as damaging many homes and mobile homes. A week later, on 19 April, another tornado brought winds of up to 170mph to southern Mississippi, creating a total of 227 miles of damage through the state in the course of a week.\nRecords were broken last week when, on 25 April, a tropical depression formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, almost three weeks before the official start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season. The depression occurred far out at sea, south-west of Mexico, and didn’t make landfall. However, this is the earliest ever recorded formation of a tropical depression in the ocean basin since records began in 1966.\nAnother record was broken this month when Cuba recorded its highest temperature since records began. On 12 April temperatures reached 39.3C in the town of Veguitas. This was mainly due to a strong high pressure system and light winds allowing for heat to become trapped at the surface. The previous record had been 39.1 degrees, recorded last year on 30 June.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

And we’ve got everybody else kind of rallying around this effort to get to an ambitious climate agreement the next year in Paris, and Abbott was really one of the last holdouts dragging his feet.”\nAbbott used his own speech to the G20 leaders’ retreat to declare that his government had fulfilled its domestic-policy promises to the Australian people, including “that I would repeal the carbon tax, and that’s gone”.

Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter?\nYou would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story.\nSome preliminary studies in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog‑standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in?\nCricket feels heat as climate crisis creates corridor of uncertainty\nRead more\nWe know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise – children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China; the New South Wales spinner Steve O’Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like “smoking 80 cigarettes a day”; the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn’t breathe.\nNot only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires.\nThis dovetails alarmingly with the Hit for Six report published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers’ ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires’ capacity, to make decisions.\nThrow in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy.\nSign up to the Spin – our weekly cricket round-up\nRead more\nAdd our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021.\nAn existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer – with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nNovak Djokovic said he had experienced air quality issues in tournaments in China. Photograph: TPN/Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nSome might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul. But if not now, when?\nOn Wednesday the sports sector held its own version of the Petersberg climate dialogue, a Zoom meeting organised by Basis (the British Association for Sustainable Sport) with the idea of bringing the sector together. The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward.\nRussell Seymour, chief executive of Basis, says: “This is not how we want to live our lives, locked down, insular. But this is the moment, the opportunity for sport to reflect and decide to rebuild its operations in a more environmentally sustainable way. After the economic crash in 2008 people said: ‘We clearly have to make a change, the current way we are living our lives isn’t working.’ Then global emissions jumped by 6% the following year. The current crisis has shown us that making changes can have a big impact and very quickly.”\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\nThis is sport’s chance to evaluate properly its current plight – as some have already started to do. To embrace localism. Accept that less is more. Ask itself why. Why do the England cricket teams have to tour three countries in a winter? Why is the ICC planning to host T20 World Cups in consecutive years? Why on earth hold football’s European Championship across 12 host cities? Why must the Olympic Games move to a different city every four years? Why squeeze every drop out of athletes for maximum profit until they cannot cope and break down, both mentally or physically? Why not demand lower levels of pollution around sports grounds for the good of athletes and fans? Reset. Breathe.\nWho has time for sustainability now? Sport does. It has to.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It contacted the company, which responded by saying it had withdrawn the campaign.\nColin Baines, from the group Stop Funding Heat, which campaigns for environmentally responsible advertising, was one of those who raised concerns.\n“It is very welcome that Aramco has withdrawn its advertisement campaign making preposterous claims of ‘real sustainability’ and ‘powering a more sustainable future’,” he said.\n“These ads were self evidently ‘materially misleading’ and therefore in breach of ASA rules. As my complaint stated, Aramco is advertising crude oil, which meets no definition of being sustainable.”\nPlay Video\n3:46\nWhy we need political action to tackle the oil, coal and gas companies - video explainer\nLast year the Guardian revealed that Saudi Aramco had produced almost 5% of all global emissions since 1965 and was on course to massively expand its oil and gas operations in the next decade.\nAdvertisement\nBaines added: “Its claim to be committed to ‘reducing greenhouse gas emissions and powering a more sustainable future’ is the antithesis of reality when it plans to increase crude oil production and carbon emissions considerably to 2030.”\nSaudi Aramco defended its record, saying it was necessary to “both meet global energy demand and lower emissions”. In a statement to the Guardian it said: “Aramco has a long-standing track record in reducing emissions from its operations. We have invested for decades in sustainable operations and have achieved the lowest carbon intensity of any major oil producer.”\nThe adverts appeared in The Week magazine and The Economist online at the beginning of the year.

In the case of this particular ad, it was put on hold at the request of the client.”\nThe Week magazine declined to comment.\nThe ASA confirmed it had received 61 complaints challenging the advert’s claims about sustainability, which people said were “misleading in the context of an ad for an oil company”.\nAn ASA spokesperson said: “We approached the advertiser with the concerns that had been raised.

No government should offer them a lifeline","paragraph":"D\no Not Resuscitate. This tag should be attached to the oil, airline and car industries. Governments should provide financial support to company workers while refashioning the economy to provide new jobs in different sectors. They should prop up only those sectors that will help secure the survival of humanity and the rest of the living world.\nThey should either buy up the dirty industries and turn them towards clean technologies, or do what they often call for but never really want: let the market decide. In other words, allow these companies to fail.\nThis is our second great chance to do things differently. It could be our last. The first, in 2008, was spectacularly squandered. Vast amounts of public money were spent reassembling the filthy old economy, while ensuring that wealth remained in the hands of the rich. Today, many governments appear determined to repeat that catastrophic mistake.\nWhat happens after coronavirus will determine our climate's future\nRead more\nThe “free market” has always been a product of government policy. If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel – hundreds of millions of unsaleable barrels, to be more precise – just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector’s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today.\nThe Bank of England has decided to buy debt from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has given easyJet a £600m loan even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away £171m in dividends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes $25bn (£20.1bn) for airlines. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and sweeping away pollution laws, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to rescue their airlines and car manufacturers.\nAdvertisement\nDon’t believe them when they tell you they do this on our behalf. A recent survey by Ipsos of 14 countries suggests that, on average, 65% of people want climate change to be prioritised in the economic recovery. Everywhere, electorates must struggle to persuade governments to act in the interests of the people, rather than the corporations and billionaires who fund and lobby them. The perennial democratic challenge is to break the bonds between politicians and the economic sectors they should be regulating, or, in this case, closing down.\nEven when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent letter to the government from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they “do more to tackle the climate crisis” could have been written in 1990. Air travel is inherently polluting. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts.\nThe current crisis gives us a glimpse of how much we need to do to pull out of our disastrous trajectory. Despite the vast changes we have made in our lives, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to reduce by only about 5.5% this year. A UN report shows that to stand a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5C or more of global heating, we need to cut emissions by 7.6% per year for the next decade. In other words, the lockdown exposes the limits of individual action. Travelling less helps, but not enough. To make the necessary cuts we need structural change. This means an entirely new industrial policy, created and guided by government.\nThe Guardian view on the climate and coronavirus: global warnings\nRead more\nGovernments like the UK’s should drop their road-building plans. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground.\nDuring the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and – when physical distancing is less necessary – public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand – through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver.\nAdvertisement\nIn other words, let’s have what many people were calling for long before this disaster hit: a green new deal. But please let’s stop describing it as a stimulus package. We have stimulated consumption too much over the past century, which is why we face environmental disaster. Let us call it a survival package, whose purpose is to provide incomes, distribute wealth and avoid catastrophe, without stoking perpetual economic growth. Bail out the people, not the corporations. Bail out the living world, not its destroyers.

The target is currently the subject of debate within the bloc.\nMany countries are planning big investments in fossil fuel industries as part of their economic rescue packages. For instance, in the US the bailout of the airline industry is set to go ahead without conditions attached on their emissions, while the White House has moved to weaken a raft of environmental regulations. In China, subsidies for fossil fuel vehicles and the easing of permits for coalmining are also likely to raise emissions.\nWhile greenhouse gas emissions are set to fall this year, perhaps by as much as a tenth, any beneficial impact on the climate is likely to be short-lived and could quickly be outweighed by increased emissions if the economic recovery resumes on a high-carbon path. Low oil prices mean producers are running out of economic ways to store their excess.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAntónio Guterres is seen on a screen during the video conference of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin. Photograph: Michael Kappeler/AFP via Getty Images\nCampaigners and experts have been calling for economic rescue packages to be directed towards environmentally sustainable ends and for sectoral stimulus cash to come with green strings attached.\nAdvertisement\nDominic Raab, the UK’s foreign secretary, said: “It will be the duty of every responsible government to see that our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that will stand the test of time. That means investing in industries and infrastructure that can turn the tide on climate change and doing all we can to boost resilience by shaping economies that can withstand everything nature throws at us.”\nHowever, he failed to set out any measures on how the UK government would ensure that its rescue packages – for instance, those called for by the airline and car manufacturing industries – were balanced with conditions that would ensure benefiting companies had to take action to reduce carbon use in the future.\nRichard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it was time for such measures. “Backing for a clean recovery is now widespread, led by governments and major businesses,” he said. “For actions to match rhetoric, concrete policies are going to be needed very soon – for example, the UK government delivering new policies that get the nation on track to its legally binding net-zero target, and making sure the world doesn’t bounce back into high-polluting ways as soon as the lockdown eases.”\nGuterres called for tougher action on cutting emissions, as well as more investment. “Public funds should invest in the future by flowing to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end, and carbon must have a price so polluters will pay for their pollution,” he said.\nGuterres also called for developing countries to receive $100bn (£82bn) a year, a longstanding goal under the global climate negotiations, to help them curb emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, and he hinted at moves to reduce the debt on many developing countries, which has been mooted as a way to help them during the Covid-19 pandemic. “We cannot allow the heavy and rising debt burden of developing countries to serve as a barrier to their ambition [on the climate],” he said.\nRich countries must all commit to zero-carbon emissions by 2050, added Guterres, with a particular nod to the US and China. “The Paris agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the US and China. Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts will be doomed.”\nHelen Clarkson, the chief executive of The Climate Group, a set of businesses accelerating action on the climate, said companies were still committed to climate action. “With the right green stimulus policies that ramp up investment in long-term sustainable solutions from electric transport to clean efficient energy, we can deliver on the goals of the Paris agreement without compromising on economic growth,” she said.\nThe UK will host global climate talks next year, after the UN’s Cop26 summit had to be postponed from its original date of this November. No date has yet to be set for the rearranged meeting, but work is continuing on diplomatic engagement aimed at encouraging countries to come forward with more ambitious climate plans, according to the UK government.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Describing itself as a “full-frontal assault on our sacred cows”, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to the climate crisis.\nPlanet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after describing it as “full of misinformation”, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film “more power and mystique than it deserves”. A free version on YouTube has been viewed more than 3m times.\nA letter written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary Gasland, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of “shockingly misleading and absurd” film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans “trades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points” that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal.\nMichael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox’s letter, said the film includes “various distortions, half-truths and lies” and that the filmmakers “have done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.” The film’s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down.\nPlanet of the Humans has been shown at Moore’s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was “perhaps the most urgent film we’ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival”. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists’ efforts rather than technological fixes.\nMichael Moore: 'We have the power to crush Trump'\nRead more\nClimate activist Bill McKibben, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has “never taken a penny in pay” from any environmental group.\n“I am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I’ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,” McKibben said. “It does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.”\nRenewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions.\nIn fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them, research has shown they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car.\nGenerating all power from renewables will take significant upgrades of grid infrastructure and storage but several researchers have declared the goal feasible, most likely with carbon-capture technology for remaining fossil fuel plants. Scientists say the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050 to head off disastrous global heating, which would likely spur worsening storms, heatwaves, sea level rise and societal unrest.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

The count has been going up faster than at any time in human history. A combination of wildfires in California, Australia and the Amazon, more coal stations in China and minor trends such as British motorists buying ever bigger cars have all made extra contributions to the already profligate use of fossil fuels. On 18 April CO2 reached 416.76 parts per million, 3.13 ppm more than last year, and way above the 350 ppm scientists consider to be safe. The “safe level” is a euphemism – above that limit areas in the tropics become too hot and dry to be habitable, many coastal cities sink below sea level and millions join mass migrations.\nIn May the readings usually begin to drop as plants and trees in the northern hemisphere remove carbon from the atmosphere in their spring spurt of growth, only for levels to rise again in the autumn.\nThis year the pandemic may change that depressing cycle. Earlier than usual the CO2 growth has peaked as factories have closed and traffic thinned. How politicians plan the recovery will determine whether we can ever again reach a “safe level” or doom civilization to inevitable collapse.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

He said the issue had been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as many people affected by bushfires in regional communities later lost the income they relied on from tourism and hospitality.\n“Insurance promises to offer peace of mind, but with delayed claims, confusing policies that don’t always provide the expected coverage and woeful responses to financial hardship by the insurance industry we’re concerned that home insurance still isn’t working for many people,” Brody said.\nThe law centre’s call follows similar warnings elsewhere. Murich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, last year told the Guardian that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable as it attributed US$24bn of losses from the Californian wildfires on human-induced heating.\nIn October, the Reserve Bank of Australia found it was increasingly important that investors and institutions manage carbon risk, and warned insurers were the most directly exposed to climate change. It said inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters were more than twice as large last decade as the one before, and was likely to continue to grow.\nThe Consumer Action Law Centre said since the summer bushfires it had received reports from community organisations in regional areas of significant delays in insurers undertaking assessments or arranging quotes for bushfire damage in remote parts of Victoria.\nIt said problems spanned different types of natural disaster, citing an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into insurance in northern Australia that found premiums had increased far more in that part of the country than elsewhere over the previous decade after insurers adopted a more fine-grained assessment of the greater risk in the north from cyclones and floods.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe group said rising costs were increasingly being worn by people who needed insurance most, when historically risk had been shared across the community.\n“We have significant concerns about how this will play out as the impact of climate change worsens, particularly for regional parts of Australia where climate change means bushfires will be more frequent and more severe,” Brody said in the centre’s submission to the royal commission.\n“It was recognised in the letters patent of this royal commission that this is the reality Australia is facing. For Australians who live in areas increasingly at risk from bushfires, premiums are going to continually (and sometimes rapidly) increase.\n“If homeowners cannot afford to rebuild due to the cost of premiums or the impacts of underinsurance, then they will be forced to leave their community.”\nConsumer Action’s recommendations include the government introducing outstanding recommendations from the banking royal commission relating to insurance as a matter of urgency to ensure people were treated fairly.\nSubmissions to the natural disasters royal commission close on Tuesday. A final report is due in August.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In February, a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq, in Greenland, set an April record of 6C on Sunday.\nIn the first quarter, the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia, where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks, large parts of the US have sweltered. Last Friday, downtown Los Angeles hit an April high of 34C, according to the National Weather Service. Western Australia has also experienced record heat.\nIn the UK, the trend is less pronounced. The daily maximum UK temperature for April so far is 3.1C above average, with records set in Cornwall, Dyfed and Gwynedd.\nKarsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, said global warming was nudging closer to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. He said his online tracker showed a relatively conservative level of 1.14C of warming due to gaps in the data, but that this could rise to 1.17C or higher once the latest figures were incorporated.\nAlthough the pandemic has at least temporarily reduced the amount of new emissions, he said the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains a huge concern.\n“The climate crisis continues unabated,” Haustein said. “The emissions will go down this year, but the concentrations keep on rising. We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels. But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives, taxes, carbon prices etc).”\nThis was echoed by Grahame Madge, a climate spokesman for the Met Office: “A reliance and trust in science to inform action from governments and society to solve a global emergency are exactly the measures needed to seed in plans to solve the next crisis facing mankind: climate change.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Others struggling with understandable anxiety are valuing the support of therapy.

As for whether therapy can help – perhaps, having trained more recently than Gary Greenberg, I’ve benefited from a different approach. As a hospice practitioner and bereavement counsellor, I learned the value of facing mortality and preparing for death. Furthermore, my professional training at Re-Vision was a training in uncertainty. We were profoundly aware of climate change and environmental destruction – problems we likely wouldn’t solve. We didn’t embark on our careers with the belief that we could necessarily “name our pain” and move on. We learned the art of bearing the seemingly unbearable.

The idea is not quite science fiction","paragraph":"I\nn 2015, flooding exposed the frozen bodies of two cave lion cubs in the Yakutia region of Russia. Members of a species that vanished at the end of the last Ice Age, the pair were buried approximately 12,000 years ago when the roof of their den collapsed and trapped them in the frozen ground. In photos, their faces are so well-preserved one might almost believe they are only sleeping.\nYet despite their unusually perfect condition, the cubs are not the only such relics to have appeared in recent years. Throughout the Arctic and subarctic, animals and artefacts buried for thousands of years are reappearing, liberated from their frozen graves by the rapid warming in the region. In the Alps and elsewhere, bodies of people lost for decades in the mountains are emerging from the ice as glaciers melt. In Australia, towns submerged for generations are resurfacing as dam levels fall due to drought and heat.\nLions, tigers and bears: the US presidents who took animal ownership to extremes\nRead more\nAs British author Robert Macfarlane has observed, these uncanny emergences or “Anthropocene unburials” are part of a larger process of unsettlement and unhinging. As human time and geological time collapse into one another, the deep past is erupting into the present all around us with terrifying and uncanny consequences. What was fixed is now in flux, what was settled is being swept away faster than we can save it. Nor is it just the past that has become unstable. The climate emergency is unsettling our future as well, erasing what we thought was certain, what we thought we knew.\nAt what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world?\nFor many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia. Over weeks and months we watched helplessly as the conflagration consumed lives, livelihoods, even entire ecosystems, while images that seemed wrenched from a dystopian future flickered across our screens. In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world.\nPart of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn old chair sticks out of the mud on the shore line of Lake Eucumbene at Old Adaminaby in 2007, a town that was flooded as part of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme in 1956. Photograph: Mark Nolan/Getty Images\nA desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, Clade, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand.\nFaced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world?\nEnvironmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present\nMy new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn’t, or isn’t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago, complete with woolly mammoths.\nIt seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to be such a being?\nAs the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human.\nJob losses, cancelled tours, delayed releases: the Australian books industry grapples with 'huge shock'\nRead more\nAlong the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal.\nAdvertisement\nYet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing.\nI began writing Ghost Species just after my father’s death. It will be published a few weeks after my mother’s. It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia’s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible.\n• Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This is incalculable,” Lakely said.\nThe Heartland Institute also posted a piece by economics professor Daniel Sutter arguing that alternative strategies to social distancing – like sheltering vulnerable populations – “could have mitigated the human toll at a significantly lower economic and social cost”.\nThe Manhattan Institute, which calls itself a free-market thinktank, ran an article from Heather MacDonald in which she wrote: “Even if my odds of dying from coronavirus should suddenly jump ten-thousand-fold, from the current rate of 0.000012 percent across the U.S. population all the way up to 0.12 percent, I’d happily take those odds over the destruction being wrought on the U.S. and global economy from this unbridled panic.”\nThe Media Research Center in a video said: “This is exactly how they incite mass panic: through lies and deception and exploiting ignorance. It’s how they convince people that we’re all going to die because Trump doesn’t believe in science or something.”\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who founded Infowars, has called the virus a “hoax” and appeared at a “You Can’t Close America” rally in Austin on Saturday, where he shook hands with unmasked supporters.\nFossil fuel supporters have also capitalized on the pandemic to warn of the costs of climate action.\nAlex Epstein, the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress which DeSmog cites as associated with various groups connected to the rightwing billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, called the current recession a “mild preview of the Green New Deal”, and said that “our biggest ally in the fight against coronavirus is the fossil fuel industry.”\nThe links between climate science denial and Covid-19 downplaying reach outside the US. In the UK, Delingpole, a rightwing commentator, has reposted calls to rapidly return to regular life.\nIn a recent podcast, he called doubters of quarantining measures “lockdown skeptics”, and referred to those who support social distancing as “hysterical bedwetters”. He accused the media of promoting panic in “hysterical tabloids”.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This administration has cleared out science and scientists across all departments. America's reputation as a competent global leader is in peril. Truth is being chased away.

Photograph: NHM London\nTogether the notes represent the first major observations of an entire breeding season of an Adélie penguin colony.\nAdvertisement\nThey are an exciting and important acquisition, Russell said. “Material such as this is often unavailable to researchers and now, for the first time, modern science has the opportunity to study Levick’s first-hand account and revisit his conclusions.\n“The importance of original manuscripts cannot be underestimated as they add crucial contextual and scientific data to our existing collections.”\nLevick was a young surgeon on Scott’s Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole and was entrusted with documenting the area’s natural history. “He is a hugely positive soul,” said Russell. “He is a nice chap.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“He becomes completely obsessed with the Adélie penguin colony. One of the greatest joys in reading the notebooks is that, when the first birds arrive, you can tell the mounting excitement that he has. It is palpable in the pages … it blows his mind.”\nLevick was shocked by elements of penguin behaviour, documenting the excesses of young males, or “hooligan cocks”, in Greek alphabet code. These include necrophilia, sexual abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour.\nBut that’s penguins for you. “The thing with penguins is that sperm is cheap,” said Russell. “They have one over-riding aim which is to fertilise and bring on the next generation … the birds will pretty much have sex with anything.”\nThe notebooks are particularly important because the area Levick was studying, Ridley Beach on Cape Adare, is still home to around 335,000 Adélie penguins, the largest colony in the world. But, scientists predict, not for much longer.\n“As we see rising sea levels, it is highly likely that the entire colony will move. Part of the value here is that this is an account of an area that will one day be lost, it will all be reclaimed by the sea.\n“As a scientist, Levick was decades ahead of his time and now, more than 100 years later, his words still have much to tell us,” said Russell.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLevick during his stay on Cape Adare, Antarctica, with the Terra Nova expedition from which he later survived being marooned. Photograph: Antarctic Heritage Trust (nz)/AFP/Getty Images\nThe survival of the notebooks is all the more remarkable because of what Levick and five others endured after their time on Cape Adare when they were unable, after the death of Scott, to re-embark on the Terra Nova.\nEffectively marooned, they were forced to make an ice cave where they lived for seven months surviving on blubber and birds they had killed. After living in “utterly horrendous” conditions, Levick then walked 200 miles back to home camp.\n“His ability to weather this storm is extraordinary,” said Russell. “I do think there is a massive parallel for us all in that whatever we think of as isolation, we are nowhere near what Levick went through. Maybe it gives us the ability to look at things in context.”\nThe announcement was made to coincide with world penguin day. The museum plans to make the notebooks physically and digitally available for future research, outreach and education\nAndrea Hart, head of special collections at the museum, said: “The Levick notebooks are a vital addition to our existing collection and the scientific observations held in original manuscripts such as these remain as relevant and important today as when they were first created.\n“We’re delighted that Levick’s work can now be accessed by academics, researchers and the public, more than a century after his seminal trip to Antarctica.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The records show that 227mm of rain fell during October 1903, but the observations are not detailed enough to show precisely where and when the most intense rainfall occurred. That’s because thousands of meticulous weather observations are recorded in copperplate hand-writing, but haven’t yet made it to digital form.\nNow they have! A call for volunteers to use Covid-19 lockdown time to help rescue rainfall records has resulted in over 15,000 people transcribing all five million UK rainfall measurements recorded between 1820 and 1960, in the space of just three weeks. Once the data has been double checked scientists will be able to compare exceptional months like October 1903 and February 2020, and understand the variation in British weather. Meanwhile, more data awaits. “The next project will be at sea, looking at ship weather logbooks,” says Ed Hawkins, who leads the Weather Rescue project.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The small non-profit Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge in 2013, said this and earlier compliance measures totalled about €3bn euros, which confirms the impact of the world’s most successful climate lawsuit to date.\nUnder the new package, coal-fired power stations will have to scale back or close completely , cattle and pig herds will be reduced, subsidies will be provided to home owners to use less concrete and more plants in their gardens, and industry will have to find alternatives for several polluting processes.\nAdvertisement\n“That is an enormous win,” said Marjan Minnesma, the director of Urgenda, which has 15-staff and operates out of two former school classrooms. “For many people this will give hope that it is possible to use the law as a strategic instrument for change.”\nAfter a seven-year legal battle, the supreme court in the Hague ordered the government in December to reduce emissions by 15 megatonnes in 2020. The judges accepted Urgenda’s argument that climate change posed a dangerous threat to human rights and the Netherlands needed to accelerate its actions to meet its international commitment of a 25% cut compared with 1990.\nTo comply, the government has adopted 30 of the proposals in Urgenda’s “54 Climate Solutions Plan”, which was drawn up in collaboration with 800 civil society groups and other organisations.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe headline change is a 75% reduction in capacity at the country’s three coal-fired power stations, all of which have been opened in the past five years. The government is also reportedly in negotiations to close one of these plants.\nIn addition, it will provide about €400m for household energy saving measures such as double glazing, €360m to compensate farmers for livestock reductions, and €30m for LED lighting in greenhouses.\nAlong with earlier steps – including lower speed limits to control emissions of nitrogen dioxide, €2bn for rooftop solar and other forms of renewable energy, solar panels on all school rooftops, more sustainable forestry and changes in the use of concrete, the measures are expected to save 8 megatonnes of emissions this year and provide extra benefits in terms of air quality and wildlife habitat.\nMinnesma said this should be seen as a “promising start” because the government is still about 4 megatonnes short of its obligations. She said the coronavirus lockdown should not be used as an excuse to backpedal.\nThe package was presented to parliament on Friday afternoon. The government said the measures would provide an economic stimulus and also help to reduce nitrogen pollution, which has been the subject of other legal actions.\nMPs said the package should inspire activists across the world to pursue litigation against governments that drag their feet.\n“Without a doubt this should encourage climate lawsuits in other countries. It’s a shining example,” said Green party politician Tom van der Lee. “This package wouldn’t be there without an order from the highest court. Without that verdict, the government would have chosen a slower trajectory.”\nThe environmental law charity ClientEarth said the result was unprecedented in Europe and testament to the impact of climate litigation, which is spreading around the world. “The Urgenda case should be considered a groundbreaking success, not just legally, but for driving real world action on climate change,” Sophie Marjanac, a ClientEarth lawyer.\nThe Dutch legal system’s ease of access and political independence of judges helped to make the case possible. If Urgenda had lost, they would only have had to pay €18,000 rather than the government’s extensive costs.\nThe Urgenda case has been closely watched around the world. While climate activists have welcomed the outcome, they urge the Netherlands to raise ambition beyond 2020 compliance with the orders of the supreme court. “The Netherlands now needs to lay out a strategy to reach net zero by around the middle of this century,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil’s inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a specific failure of independent directors to oversee management,” the letter added.\nAdvertisement\nA report released last year found that ExxonMobil would need to slash its oil production by 55% by 2040 to meet global climate targets and avoid driving temperatures 1.5C higher than pre-industrialised levels.\nThe C of E holds a small stake in Exxon, worth about £7m compared with the oil company’s market value of more than $183bn (£146bn). However, the Church Commissioners have proven to be influential shareholders regardless of their size.\nLast year, ExxonMobil appealed to US regulators and successfully blocked a C of E-led resolution that would have forced the oil firm to disclose its emissions reduction targets.

That is more than other major oil companies including shell and BP, which spent €36.5m and €18.1m respectively on lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy.\nIt also recently emerged that ExxonMobil met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to a climate lobbying watchdog.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nExxonMobil was not immediately available for comment, but in a document released ahead of its AGM it said that its position on key issues and lobbying were publicly available on its website and that it followed all applicable disclosure laws.\nThe company also defended the board’s approach to the climate crisis, saying it “routinely reviews environmental stewardship and discusses issues related to the company’s business, including the risks related to climate change”.\nAdvertisement\nExxonMobil has rejected calls for an independent chairman, saying that the rest of the board was already made up of independent directors and that the change would not improve oversight or be in shareholders’ best interest.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The precipitous drop in road and air traffic has left the air cleaner and the skies clearer. For advocates of a Green New Deal (GND) – a vast, state-funded green infrastructure project, including a total transition to renewable energy and the construction of mass transit systems – there are reasons to be optimistic. As the severity of the unfolding global recession becomes clear – the IMF predicts a 3% global contraction – the GND looks like the best route to recovery.\nCould Microsoft’s climate crisis ‘moonshot’ plan really work?\nRead more\nThe GND had been growing in popularity before the outbreak – including among establishment politicians, with all the leading Democratic presidential candidates expressing support for some form of it. But with 26 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks alone, and given that green industries are more efficient job creators than fossil-fuel ones, there is a powerful, immediate economic rationale for some kind of “green stimulus”. That is without even taking into account the longer-term economic case for decarbonizing: a 2018 US climate report calculated that the devastating effects of unchecked global warming will shrink the US economy by as much as 10% by the end of this century.\nBut the economic fallout of Covid-19 has cast a harsher light on another strand of the climate movement, commonly termed “degrowth”. Influential among Extinction Rebellion activists, but often regarded as unrealistic by mainstream policymakers, degrowthers, as their name suggests, argue that uncontrolled economic growth is ecologically unsustainable and that to avert climate catastrophe we need to not only shut down the fossil-fuel industries but to reduce consumption overall. Degrowthers insist that we must find ways of living and working that do not require our economies to endlessly expand.\nAdvertisement\nDegrowthers have been particularly susceptible to caricature in recent weeks. “The coronavirus crisis reveals the misery of degrowth,” the Spectator predictably argued. But current living conditions – sudden mass joblessness, confinement and isolation, widespread food and income insecurity – are not a meaningful foretaste of greener things to come. The nightmare we are currently enduring is not degrowth’s secret dream come true; it is at most a grotesque parody of it, and one which is now liable to be weaponized by opponents of the movement.\nReading the current moment as a repudiation of degrowth is premature and unjustified. It overlooks the distinction between what we are experiencing now – an unplanned, abrupt cessation of vast swaths of economic and social activity – and what advocates of degrowth envisage: a thoughtful, democratic, managed and equitable downsizing of the economy.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMost degrowth advocates do not champion economic contraction as such, but argue for the necessity of adapting to the continuing, long-term global stagnation sometimes called “secular stagnation”. The fact that we can only think of slowing down our economies in terms of recession and austerity – with the associated cuts to public spending, growth in inequality and decline in real earnings – says much more about our political landscape than the economic facts.\nYet there is one important criticism of degrowth that has been decisively bolstered by the sharp reversal in global economic fortunes resulting from the coronavirus lockdowns: the consequences for jobs. GDP is a notoriously crude and partial measure of a society’s wellbeing, failing to account for a whole host of indicative factors including equality, access to energy, the quality of healthcare, education and social support systems. But when GDP falls or slows because workers cannot produce goods or offer services, unemployment surges. Coronavirus has brought that reality dramatically home.\nAs the economist and energy adviser Robert Pollin has written: “the immediate effect of any global GDP contraction would be huge job losses and declining living standards for working people and the poor. During the Great Recession, global unemployment rose by over 30 million. I have not seen a convincing argument from a degrowth advocate as to how we could avoid a severe rise in mass unemployment if GDP were to fall by twice as much.”\nThe twin crises besetting us – the public health emergency and the unfolding economic trauma triggered by the measures to contain it – have laid bare much about the configuration of our world that we already knew but rarely fully apprehend: its interconnectedness, its fragility, its stark inequalities. But these crises have also brought into visceral relief the fact that employment is the heart and soul of the economy. As the British economist James Meadway has argued, the economic depression now upon us threatens “the most fundamental institution of all in capitalism: the labor market itself”.\nSince we have so little time left in which to stabilize the climate, we must be ruthlessly pragmatic in assessing the limitations of green strategies. Degrowth is no exception. The scale and speed of investment required to completely renovate the energy and transportation sectors does not seem conceivable without growth continuing, at least for the time being. Politically, as long as a steadily rising GDP remains an electoral necessity, it is difficult to imagine a recovery that doesn’t involve desperate efforts to restore growth – and not necessarily through greener means – by politicians anxious to revive flagging ratings.\nYet to fixate on the question of growth risks exaggerating the differences between the Green New Dealers and degrowthers – elevating the former as practical-minded technocratic capitalists who want a return to normal economic activity, just motored by a different energy source, and dismissing the latter as abstemious, back-to-the-land utopians who want to deprive us of most of the luxuries of modern capitalist life.\nThis in turn could lead to our learning only some of the lessons of the current predicament, and taking only some of the opportunities it offers. What both strands of climate thinking ask us to consider – and what the current crisis poses with special, brutal force, as phrases like “key workers” and “essential services” enter common parlance – is the question of what kinds of jobs we need, and what kinds our planet needs of us.\nAdvertisement\nWhich goods and services are indispensable, and which would we be better off without? Degrowth and the GND offer different answers to this question – from green infrastructure construction to the care economy – but they both pose it, as well as raising important broader questions about how, how much and why we work. Once it is safe to emerge from economic survival mode, I hope we will have the wisdom to follow the lead of both movements by systematically reflecting on which kinds of productive activity actually enrich our lives – and which among these our planet can sustain.\nLola Seaton is assistant editor at New Left Review\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops.\nResearchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.\nAdvertisement\nInsects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, outweighing humanity by 17 times, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature’s waste.\nThe previous largest assessment, based on 73 studies, led scientists to warn of “catastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind” if insect losses were not halted. Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate 50% of insects have been lost in the last 50 years.\nRecent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in Germany and 98% in Puerto Rico. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: “This 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It’s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe research, published in the journal Science, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. “Europe seems to be getting worse now – that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don’t know,” said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.\nElsewhere, data is much more sparse. “But we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat – it is not rocket science,” said van Klink. “This is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There’s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don’t have the data.”\nVan Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. “We found that very striking and a bit shocking – it means something’s going wrong there.”\nLosses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, pesticides and light pollution. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite obvious local examples. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.\nBut he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and significantly cutting grasshopper abundances on prairies in Kansas, US. ”That is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.”\nProf Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: “People should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.”\nMatt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: “Many insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.\nIn a comment article in Science, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. “Embracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,” they said.\nVan Klink said: “We definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don’t think it’s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable.\nIn his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nMH: Let’s be clear – in those clinical trials, terminally ill patients took psychedelic drugs under close medical supervision, right? But the results sound remarkable\nMP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted.\nMH: Do those experiences and your other research suggest that psychedelic drugs can be an antidote to climate grief?\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work.\nMH: How did that reset happen?\nMP: I can’t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is [help] people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected – more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who’d been working on this issue a long time. They’ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they’re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression.\nMH: If ‘antidote’ is too strong, would ‘treatment’ be a better word?\nMP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment.\nMH: But climate grief is different in important ways from an individual facing a terminal diagnosis. Climate grief is not necessarily about your own death but more about the death of the world around you – a kind of collective, civilizational death\nMP: Yeah, and here’s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist!\nMH: Are psychedelics relevant to climate grief in any other ways?\nMP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called “nature connectedness” – the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of “nature connectedness” went up consistently and fairly dramatically.\nThis rings true to me and to many of the people I’ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there’s a single subject – you – while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis – our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has – at least theoretically – the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that.\nMH: You’re a parent. I’m a parent; my daughter just turned 15. A big part of my climate grief relates to the future she’s going to inherit. And not just her but the countless other kids around the world in her generation. Can psychedelics be helpful to parents dealing with climate grief?\nMP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There’s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there’s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill.\nMH: I’ve covered climate change as a journalist for 30 years, and when people ask, I always say that the only solution to climate grief for me is taking action – doing something to make me feel I’m having an effect on this. Taking action is clearly a climate solution. Are psychedelic drugs, in a different way, also a climate solution?\nMP: No, I wouldn’t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices – giving up meat, for example – is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics … But what’s exciting and new is that we’re coming to recognize psychedelics’ therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.\nThis story originally appeared in the Nation and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate story\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Critics, meanwhile, see the move as a gamble aimed at justifying Microsoft’s ongoing deals with fossil fuel firms.\nMicrosoft releases less carbon a year than Amazon and Apple, but more than Google. The company has 150,000 employees across offices in more than 100 countries, and is still focused on developing the software and consumer electronics that made them a household name – Windows, PCs, Xbox. But after a temporary slump following their heyday in the 1990s, they have also once again become innovators, developing world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe company hopes to bring that innovative approach to its climate policies, in part by widening how it calculates its carbon footprint, beyond most corporate responsibility plans. Historically, Microsoft has only counted those emissions that fall within the scope of their own business operations – employee travel, company vehicles, heat and electricity in company buildings, and so on.\nFrom now on, it plans to take responsibility for the emissions produced by its entire supply chain, including the full lifespan of the products it makes and the electricity that customers may consume when using its products.\nMeanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft’s plan are its dealings with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using Microsoft’s technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on Microsoft’s expanded carbon ledger.\nIt will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps\nKlaus Lackner\nAdvertisement\nFor Microsoft, however, partnering with oil companies is not considered hypocritical. The company is hedging its climate bets on carbon capture and removal technologies that they believe will be able to offset some of the environmental harm caused by fossil fuels during the transition to a more sustainable future, despite such technologies being still in their nascent stages and not yet proven to work at scale.\nThose who devised the plan at Microsoft argue that they are responding directly to a new reality: cutting emissions is not enough and all routes to non-catastrophic temperature increase will also require removing carbon from the atmosphere. So, as well as shifting to a 100% supply of renewable energy for all of their data centers, buildings and campuses by 2025, Microsoft outlines a number of carbon reduction methods it is backing to try and hit its bold targets.\nProtecting forests\nTo begin, Microsoft will focus on protecting forests and planting trees to capture carbon. This strategy has long been used to offset emissions, but Microsoft is hoping to improve their outcomes by using remote-sensing technology to accurately estimate the carbon storage potential of forests to ensure no major deforestation is occurring in their allotments. To achieve these goals, Microsoft will be partnering with Pachama, a Silicon Valley startup that will survey 60,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon, plus an additional 20,000 hectares across north-eastern states of the US for the company.\nAccording to Kelsey Perlman, a climate campaigner at the forest conservation NGO Fern, Microsoft’s commitment to hi-tech reforestation is encouraging, but she stressed that conservation is a complex, multifaceted process that goes beyond technical issues. “It’s not only about how much carbon a forest can hold but also who traditionally uses the forest, how they might be kept out, and how biodiversity will be prioritized,” she said.\nBiomass energy carbon capture storage\nMicrosoft will initially focus on nature-based solutions to reduce their carbon footprint over the next five or so years. But in order to start drawing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit by 2030, it will need to shift to technology-based solutions that can scale up and accelerate carbon removal.\nTo this end, Microsoft is betting on biomass energy carbon capture storage, otherwise known as BECCS, to transform how energy is generated. Instead of burning coal, a BECCS power plant burns biomass, like wood chips. The carbon produced when burning the biomass is captured before it is released into the atmosphere and then injected at a very high pressure into rock formations deep underground. Not only does this remove carbon from the natural cycle, the biomass absorbs CO2 as it grows.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nScientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral. Illustration: Greg Betza/The Guardian\nA world powered by biofuel, however, raises two looming questions. First, scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral.\nAdvertisement\nThe second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land – some estimates say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and reducing biodiversity. “We would likely see massive land use change and massive private purchases of land, the knock on impacts of which could be quite dangerous,” she said.\nDirect air capture\nPerhaps the most futuristic of the technologies outlined in Microsoft’s carbon negative plan is direct air capture (DAC). This involves machines that essentially function like highly efficient artificial trees, drawing existing carbon out of the air and transforming it into non-harmful carbon-based solids or gasses.\nWhile the image of air-conditioner-like machines sucking carbon out of the air is captivating, capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere requires a lot of energy and is very expensive. In 2011, extracting carbon from the air cost $600 a ton of CO2. In 2018, estimates brought this down to anywhere between $94 to $232 a ton. But given that Microsoft expects to emit 16m metric tons of carbon this year, if they were to reach carbon zero using only DAC, their bill might cost as much as $3.5bn.\nAccording to Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, a large part of the reason why carbon removal remains so expensive is because the markets around these technologies are still immature. The company’s strategy over the coming decades is maturing these markets through intensive and directed investment. “We’re making a bet on certain technologies that don’t exist at the scale or price point we need them to,” he said. “But if we want to get them, we need to start investing.”\nAdvertisement\nThe company, he said, already has a model for raising funds internally to support climate innovation. In July 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to institute an internal carbon price, charging different divisions in the business $15 a metric ton of carbon emitted. The funds raised were then used to pay for sustainability improvements, which helped the company achieve their goal of going carbon neutral.\nPreviously, this carbon price only extended over emissions Microsoft was directly responsible for. According to their new plan, in July this year Microsoft will extend this internal carbon price over emissions produced across direct and indirect emissions. The increased revenue raised from the expanded internal carbon tax, along with a $1bn climate innovation fund, will be used to invest in capture and removal technology. “What we’re going to do is put this money in the market in a way that is highly additional,” Joppa said. “This is how we’re going to get nature-based solutions and tech solutions at a price point and scale we need.”\nMicrosoft’s plan for intensive investment in this industry is exciting for those working in the field. Klaus Lackner, a theoretical physicist working on DAC, has been arguing since the 1990s that carbon removal is the only feasible way to stop significant temperature rises. “We’ve shown that this method is technologically feasible, but nobody has wanted them,” he said. “Microsoft have said ‘we get it’. It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps.”\nWhile the technologies that Microsoft are betting on are still in their nascent stages, in the past few years there has been some encouraging progress in the negative emissions industry. Lackner and Arizona State University recently signed a deal with Silicon Kingdom, an Irish-based company, to manufacture his carbon-suck machines. The plan is to install them on wind and solar farms, and then sell the captured carbon to beverage companies to make carbonated drinks. In the UK, Drax power plant, which was once among Europe’s most polluting, has transitioned from coal to biomass.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPart of Microsoft’s carbon removal strategy is to store carbon underground. Illustration: Greg Betza/The Guardian\nAdvertisement\nBut many attempts at scaling carbon negative projects have also failed. The Kemper Project in Mississippi, which was billed as America’s flagship carbon capture project, was abandoned in 2017 – it was $5bn over budget, three years late and still not operational.\nMoral hazard\nGiven the not insignificant risk of failure, some propose that relying on nascent or future technology as a solution to the climate crisis represents a moral hazard – the promise of carbon removal functions as an incentive for governments and major polluters to not change their behavior now.\nIt’s extremely hard to lead if there’s no one there to follow\nLucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft\nAccording to Chris Adams, a tech worker who organizes an online community of technology professionals agitating for climate action from within the industry, the fact that Microsoft is still partnering with big oil companies demonstrates the moral hazard in action. “They are protecting the fossil fuel industry from changing while the rest of the world will pay most from this gamble if it fails in the long term,” he said.\nAdams added that many of the encouraging ideas around carbon reduction in Microsoft’s plan have come from internal organizing from concerned employees, but that this mostly goes unacknowledged in Microsoft’s official vision. Emphasizing future technology while overlooking activism in the present, Adams said, represents a certain way of approaching problems that is typical of technology companies. “If you have spent the last 10 years amassing influence by approaching most problems with technology it’s understandable you see all problems through this lens, particularly if you don’t have to have conversations about power,” he said.\nWhen asked about this concern by the Guardian, Microsoft’s Joppa responded that in the short term, the energy demands of a growing global population will probably still need a mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. By remaining in discourse with these industries, he said, Microsoft hopes to help them change and transition to a better model in the future. “It’s extremely hard to lead if there’s no one there to follow,” he added.\nAs to whether the technology outlined in their plan will scale, he said there is inherent risk, but this is why they call it a “moonshot”. “When it comes to our plan it’s not like we’ve got it all figured out,” he said. “We’re just trying to do what the science says the whole world needs to do. There’s really no other choice.”\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

The grant was broadly considered a concession to pro-coal Queensland Nationals MPs.\nThe new information about the proposal – obtained by sources with knowledge of Shine’s closely guarded business case and other information submitted to the federal government before it was awarded the feasibility study grant – casts doubt on key public claims about the environmental merit and commercial viability of a Collinsville plant.\nCollinsville: the Queensland town on the frontline of the coal wars\nRead more\nShine said it could not respond to questions, claiming that details of its proposal were confidential. The company indicated that aspects of the project might have changed since it submitted documentation to the federal government but it would not provide any detail.\nThe company has pitched its Collinsville coal proposal as having the potential to reduce carbon emissions by allowing the closure of higher-emitting power stations elsewhere in the state.\nBut a lack of available water allocation at Collinsville poses a technical challenge for the financing, design and construction of any plant that would emit a lower proportion of carbon, compared with the last generation of coal plants built in Queensland – which has the newest fleet in Australia.\nAdvertisement\nShine has submitted information that shows that by using a dry-cooling system the plant’s emissions intensity would be comparable to the last two plants built in Queensland – Kogan Creek, commissioned in 2007, and Millmerran, commissioned in 2002. Both produce emissions at a rate slightly above .80 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour.\nSources say Shine’s studies identified it could pollute about 10% to 15% less carbon dioxide if it built a plant with a wet-cooling system, which requires large volumes of water.\nPlans to build a large dam at the nearby Urannah Creek have been touted as a way to supply water to heavy industry, including a coal-fired power station. But while the Urannah Dam is backed by many of the same political and business interests as the proposed power station, it is bitterly opposed by local Indigenous traditional owners, including Shine Energy and some of its directors.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe Shine Energy chief executive, Ash Dodd, told Guardian Australia in February that the power generator proposal would not rely on the Urannah Dam.\n“We as Birri and Widi traditional owners stand opposed to the [Urannah Dam] project as it will have a major environmental impact on our sacred rivers and all water rights belong to our people.”\nRichie Merzian, the climate and energy director at the Australia Institute, said the federal government had spent $1.3bn attempting to improve the emissions intensity of coal since 2003.\n“It is damning that the best technology they can find now has the same emissions intensity as plants built 15 years ago,” Merzian said. “If the best they can do is build another plant like Kogan Creek, it will do little for reliability, given this plant is the most unreliable on the grid per unit of energy.”\nDodd has raised the prospect that Collinsville could allow for the closure older, dirtier plants, including the privately operated Gladstone power station (.95 tonnes CO2 per MWh), though the Queensland government is firmly opposed to that suggestion and Gladstone has commercial energy supply contracts running until 2029.\nThe state’s opposition to the Collinsville plant could also prove problematic for Shine in its efforts to obtain finance.\nIn interviews, Dodd has said the company has held discussions with overseas-based investors and would apply for Naif financing. Guardian Australia understands Shine is pursuing a concessional federal loan from the Naif program, which it expects could then catalyse additional interest from private investors.\nThe Queensland government holds an effective veto over any Naif loan to a project in the state.\nA Naif spokesman said it “cannot comment on whether or not it has been approached by particular entities in respect of particular projects”.\nShine Energy’s shares are worth $1,000 on paper and the company will require about $2bn in outside financing to build the power generator.\nIn addition to seeking Naif funding, Shine has applied for federal government underwriting against potential future losses. It was not named among shortlisted projects for a federal energy underwriting program.\nQueensland energy minister tells Angus Taylor he's 'deeply concerned' about Collinsville coal plans\nRead more\nEnergy sector analysts say the extent to which Shine has asked for government subsidy should dismiss outright any suggestion that a coal-fired power station at Collinsville could be independently viable.\n“Large subsidies are the only way they can get it up and running,” said Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s a project that’s entirely unbankable by any private financier. It’s 100% an ideological exercise, there’s no commercial viability.”\nShine’s director of marketing and communications, Kelli Cohen, warned Guardian Australia against printing “inaccurate information” but said the company “can not respond” to any aspect of this story due to commercial confidentiality.\nThis is despite Dodd previously speaking about emissions intensity, potential funding sources, government subsidies and other technical details in interviews on Sky News.\nAdvertisement\n“You have not been given an up to date project brief from your source,” Cohen said.\nShine did not respond to subsequent attempts to clarify what details might have changed.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

He explains why he’s prioritising the issue during a strict national lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19, which could send New Zealand’s unemployment rate soaring.\nTo say that we find ourselves in an unprecedented moment is so obvious and has been so often repeated it’s almost become white noise. What is less obvious, however, is where we go from here.\nIn any significant crisis, let alone one as catastrophic as the Covid-19 pandemic, it is an entirely understandable human reflex to want things to “return to normal”, to “go back to the way they were before”.\nEarth Day: Greta Thunberg calls for 'new path' after pandemic\nRead more\nAnd, when faced with economic headwinds – in recent decades, the Asian financial crisis, the global financial crisis and, in our own case, the Christchurch earthquakes) successive governments the world over have directed their efforts to meeting public expectation and getting back to business as usual.\nUnfortunately, one of the features of business as usual was a highly polluting and ecologically unsustainable economy on a pathway that was locking in catastrophic climate change.\nSuccessive responses to economic crises have seen climate change and the natural environment we depend on for life on Earth as a nice-to-have, something to think about once we’ve got the economy back on track and there’s a bit more money to go round.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nJames Shaw. Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images\nThis means that action on climate change keeps being deferred, as economic shocks occur on average about every ten years. It also means that, when we do collectively start feeling confident enough to start worrying about climate change again, we find that our economic recovery programmes have locked us back in to the same highly polluting pathway we were on before.\nWe quite simply cannot afford to do that one more time. Global CO2 emissions need to at least halve in the next 10 years, according to a 1992 treaty, the United Nations framework convention on climate change. If we spend the next few years restoring business as usual, we will have only a few years left to transform that business as usual into something else. It simply won’t be able to be done.\nThis time, we could do it differently. This time, we could plan our recovery to create a clean-tech, high-value economy that works for everyone.\nIn which case, rather than willing things back to “normal” as quickly as possible, let’s imagine something different for a moment. A future where people have everything they need to lead fulfilling, meaningful and prosperous lives. Where simple everyday tasks like making the morning coffee, to travelling to and from work, to warming our homes is powered by clean, renewable energy.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nA future where electricity demand goes up – but only because people are plugging in their electric vehicles. Where cheap, clean power brings significant economic benefits for small businesses, and rural communities. Above all, a future that is more equitable, more prosperous, and more innovative – and all within planetary limits.\nWe know it is in our power to change the way we do things. Over the last few months, nearly all of us have made changes to the way we live and work in order to protect people and their loved ones around the world. Our responses to Covid-19 – as parents, as friends, as neighbours – have made clear just what it is that we value more than anything else.\nNot only this, but we have seen the difference good governments can make to people’s lives – and that we can, when we need to, make bold decisions for the collective good.\nWe have also been reminded in the most profound and difficult way why we must act in accordance with science.\nClearly, government spending over the next few months needs to ease the economic pressures people and businesses are feeling right now. But that doesn’t mean it cannot also change the quality of economic growth and reduce its impact on the climate. Nor does it mean that governments cannot apply a climate lens to every major policy decision, as New Zealand is doing.\nAn economic stimulus is partly about choice. In the past, governments have made these choices based on the view that investments and values are separable. But they’re not. Our investments reflect our values.\nDonald Trump is wrong, the economic hit of the coronavirus will last for years\nBarry Eichengreen\nRead more\nNearly every country in the world has committed to playing their part in a global effort to clean up our economies and avoid the worse effects of climate change.\nHere in New Zealand, our parliament has – unanimously – enshrined the Paris goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in domestic legislation. On Wednesday, I asked our new, politically independent, climate change commission to review whether our international target is consistent with that Paris goal.\nIf they conclude that there is more we need to do, the commission will provide recommendations on what changes we should make. This will ensure we are playing our part globally. I hope that other countries will do the same, if they aren’t already.\nIt is a time for governments, regions, and cities around the world to mobilise and deploy resources to tackle the climate crisis at the same time as rebuilding their economies, all whilst creating high value green jobs.\nThis is indeed an unprecedented moment. What we do with it will determine the quality of life for billions of people – not just for the next few months or years, but for the generations to come.\nJames Shaw is New Zealand’s climate change minister and co-leader of the Green party.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere.\nIn an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change.\nThis week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a “green” tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a “farm” in its challenges.\nJillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: “We had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCovid-19 masks at an Earth Day event in Seoul, South Korea, linking ecosystem destruction to the root causes of the coronavirus pandemic.

It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,” she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.\n“If the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.”\nThe teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockström, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHe said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. “The scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,” he said. “We are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.”\nThe lockdown has reduced emissions and hurt the oil industry, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy.\nThe key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nStudents take part in a climate march on 14 February in London. Campaigns appear to have shifted public opinion about the climate. Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images\n“We have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,” Rockström said. “Around the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it’s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We’ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.”\nHe said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities.\nEarth Day 2020 could mark the year we stop taking the planet for granted\nRichard Deverell\nRead more\nNeither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.\n“During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.”\nElsewhere, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.\nHe said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.\nA new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations – the US and Australia – a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes.\nPublic opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets.\n“We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

But the trigger was not known.\nHowever, several months of unusually high rainfall preceded the eruption, with one 24-hour period setting a record for the entire US. This flood of water would have percolated down into fissures and pores in the rocks of the volcano, as far as 1.8 miles (2.9km) below the surface.\nAdvertisement\nThe scientists calculated this pushed up the pore pressure inside the rocks to the highest level in almost 50 years, weakening them and allowing magma to push up from below.\nThe scientists also looked at eruptions of Kīlauea since 1790 and found that these historical events were twice as likely to happen in the rainy season. Such a link has long been thought possible – JD Dana, one of the first geologists to visit Hawaii in the late 1800s, suggested the idea.\nThey also ruled out magma pressure from below triggering the eruption, because the surface had barely deformed, and the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, which can trigger eruptions.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“All the circumstantial evidence points in the same direction,” said Jamie Farquharson, at the University of Miami, whose research is published in the journal Nature. Rain has been linked to shallow eruptions in the past, such as at Mount St Helens in 1980, but this is the first time an impact at depth has been found.\n“Critically, as our climate continues to change, the occurrence of prolonged periods of extreme rainfall is predicted to increase in many parts of the world, increasing the potential for rainfall-triggered volcanic phenomena,” said Farquharson, adding that research on the phenomenon was needed on other volcanoes. Other scientists have warned that the melting of ice on volcanic peaks may also cause eruptions.\nFarquharson said rainfall could now be an additional factor taken into account when assessing the risk of a volcano erupting.\nMichael Manga, at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the study, said: “Volcanoes are part of a dynamic Earth system.

A further €9.47bn is being sought by other airlines, data tracking by Transport & Environment, Greenpeace and Carbon Watch reveals.\nBy the time air travel came to a near halt in March, greenhouse gas emissions from the sector had reached record levels. But there are no binding environmental conditions being attached to any of the already agreed bailouts or future loans being sought.\nThe exception is in Austria, where the transport minister, Leonore Gewessler, responded to a request for public support by Austrian Airlines (part of the Lufthansa group) by saying any bailout should be linked to climate targets.\nThe amounts being negotiated for bailout plans and recapitalisation are likely to increase as talks continue with some of the biggest European airlines, including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and Alitalia.\nQuick guide\nWhat zero emissions in 2050 would mean for the UK\nShow\nThe Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:\n• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.\n• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.\n• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\n• Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.\n• A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs.

He has been told to explore other ways of getting cash before seeking state aid but environmental conditions have not been at the forefront of government comments on the bailout plea.\nEasyJet, which has secured a £600m emergency loan from the UK government, emitted 4.1% more CO2 in 2019 than in 2018.\nAndrew Murphy, the aviation manager for Transport & Environment, said: “Airlines are seeking public money so they can get back to the business-as-usual of soaring emissions enabled by light-touch pollution laws and tax exemptions.\n“It’s time to ensure that aviation makes a green transition by linking aid to taxes and greener fuels which will reverse the sector’s rapid emissions growth.”\nAviation is one of the fastest growing contributors to greenhouse gas emissions over the past 20 years.

But we will need the masks to protect ourselves from the fires that will likely come back this summer and fall. Presumably, there won’t be any N95 masks left by that time, when we’ll need protection from the smoke if we’re ordered to evacuate, as we had to last year, for more than a week, when the Kincade fire scorched 77,758 acres of our county of Sonoma.\nIn 2018, fires burned nearly 2 million acres in California. And in 2017, fire charred through a significant portion of my hometown. When the university where I teach recently closed for the semester because of shelter-at-home orders, it was the fourth closure in three years (the other three due to fires or smoke from fires). You could hear the weary tone in the administrators’ emails, thanking us for being attentive, yet again, to the needs of our traumatised students.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nDuring the first disorienting week of shelter at home, we whispered to our climate emergency friends: “Psst! Isn’t this what we’ve been hoping for? The sudden reduction in air travel? The shrinkage in fossil fuel emissions? Did you hear greenhouse gases dropped 25% in China during February? And people are taking online classes in carbon sequestration gardening techniques? And that judge finally cancelled a key permit for the Dakota Access pipeline?”\nIt felt, at first, like some sort of divine intervention. I couldn’t get the Anna Akhmatova poem out of my head: “Everything is plundered, betrayed, and spent / the wings of black death have flown by / why, then, do we feel so radiant?” In any case, this stay-at-home remedy for the pandemic was a far superior experience to what we go through during fires. We could breathe fresh air! At least, those of us who didn’t have the virus.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the reality of the economic toll set in, as well as the realisation that Donald Trump was using this opportunity to roll back more environmental restrictions, and realised that marginalised people were the ones dying in largest numbers, it became evident that there was no real silver lining. All around were the same symptoms of a system heading in the wrong direction. One student wrote to me: “I’m looking forward to things getting normal again.” The only problem is that things weren’t normal before.\nAnd when the winds pick up this October, electricity and gas provider PG&E will, most likely, turn off the power for one, two or maybe more weeks to try to avoid another catastrophic conflagration due to a drought-diseased tree crashing onto a live power line and burning up the region. If we are still sheltering at home, no power means no internet, no Zoom, no Netflix. More importantly, when the fires come, where and how will we evacuate while physical distancing?\nAfter the fires, any illusions we had held that humanity could triumph over nature came apart. When Covid-19 erupted, it felt a little like a “Hold my beer. We’ve got this!” kind of moment, not because we had any control – quite the opposite – but because we’d had an apprenticeship with our own powerlessness against the forces of nature. But that powerlessness realigns us to the patterns of a more profound reality than our own.\nRevealed: nearly 100 US transit workers have died of Covid-19 amid lack of basic protections\nRead more\nI’m deeply heartened, even astonished by the unprecedented rising global solidarity, this communitas, in response to the pandemic, and what it promises we are capable of. It’s too soon to measure how this global pause will affect global greenhouse emissions. Early estimates predict a 5% decline this year, but short of the 7.6% needed every year for 10 years to limit warming to 1.5C. Clearly this stay-at-home method, leading to a potential economic collapse, isn’t the best way to bring down emissions. Others have written convincingly how a New Green Deal makes more economic sense than trying to prop up a collapsing fossil fuel industry, how, in the US, 5.2m permanent clean-energy jobs could replace the 2.2m fossil-fuel job loss.\nHaving said that, I think we have put too little emphasis protecting the planet by understanding, honouring, and facilitating its life-sustaining processes and carbon sinks. Perhaps staying home gives us some time to observe these processes. We must stay six feet apart from each other, but not from the Earth.\nAdvertisement\n• Christina Nichol is the author of the novel Waiting for the Electricity.

In San Francisco, a small group broke away from the great crowd to dump oil into a reflecting pool outside the office building of Standard Oil Company of California.

From Miami to the Pacific North-west and from Augusta, Maine, to Southern California, children were piping grisly parodies of popular songs.

(February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let’s think outside the pandemic bubble.)\nSimpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel described a permanently yellow horizon: “I not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.” Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: “The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller’s are black as coal.” You’ve probably heard of Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River catching fire, but here’s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller described the Hudson south of Albany: “One great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America’s cities then.\nIt’s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the first Earth Day in 1970 – 10% of America’s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country’s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a series of photos that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it’s hard to imagine that we tolerated this.\nBut we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we’re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can’t see them.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today’s levels you can’t see it or smell it, and it doesn’t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That’s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don’t quite see it.\nAnd it’s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It’s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It’s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There’s no catalytic converter for CO2, which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.\nThat in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and may even own them, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.\nAnd so we are. Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase – the planet’s largest by market capitalization – which has funneled a quarter-trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like Liberty Mutual, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL during a pandemic.\nAdvertisement\nThis campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock announced that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to edge away from coal. And Chase – well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the protest in January that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there’s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.\nStill, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it’s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.\nOur job – a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago – is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as Donald Trump does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That’s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets last September. That’s not 20 million, but it’s on the way.\nWe can’t be on the streets right now. So we’ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet.

Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”.\nAmong the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix.\nOn Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays.\nWas this helpful?\nFridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, Talks for Future, which features climate scientists and other experts.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLeah Namugerwa, 15, from Kampala, Uganda. Photograph: Leah Namugerwa\nActivists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects.\nThis new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. “My activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn’t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,” she says.\nDeniz Çevikus, 12, from Istanbul, who usually protests alone, enjoys talking to more people online. “During a typical solo strike I can talk to 20 or 30 people at most, but with the same [digital] strike I can reach thousands of people on social media,” she says.\n“Striking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDeniz Çevikus, 12, from Istanbul: ‘Striking before the virus was more challenging.

And also, we are just teenagers, so it’s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.”\nWhile the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning.\n“We are more present on the streets, and we know it’s not a social media bubble – we’re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,” Nielsen says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark: ‘We will start to see more of an international perspective because of this.’ Photograph: Rikke Nielsen\nAs the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority.\n“It’s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,” says Hamilton. “We know that you can’t do everything all at once.”\nDylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow, Scotland. Photograph: Dylan Hamilton\nThere is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle – not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed.\n“We’ve lost a bit of motivation,” Hamilton adds. “We don’t know when we’re going to be able to do the big protests again.”\nBut there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change.\n“Seeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,” says Palmer. “When politicians tell us things don’t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Half a century later, this annual day unites millions across the globe, drawing attention to the huge challenges facing our planet.\nNow more than ever, Earth Day offers an opportunity for us all to reflect upon our relationship with the planet, amid the most powerful possible message that nature can surprise us at any moment, with devastating consequences for pretty much every individual. It is a time when the health of the planet and its people has never been so important.\nThis year held great promise for environmental change on the back of growing pressure for concerted, urgent action and with a suite of international conferences set to refocus global commitment on these key issues. The nexus between nature, climate and sustainable development was embodied in 2020. The year offered hope.\n'Tip of the iceberg': is our destruction of nature responsible for Covid-19?\nRead more\nThere was much talk of nature as the bridge between the biodiversity and climate crises, of nature-based solutions such as forestation, peatland restoration and the protection of mangroves as the answers to some of the challenges we face today, and of natural capital supporting sustainable development and human wellbeing.\nThe postponement of COP15 and COP26 – the international conferences which were set to determine new global targets on biodiversity and climate change later this year – was, clearly, the right step to take when the world is grappling with a pandemic like coronavirus, but we should not let the momentum of what had been hailed as a “super year” for the environment be lost.\nWe are in an age of extinction and at the point where irreversible environmental damage could be wrought. Despite changed plans, we cannot afford to lose pace nor focus. The challenge of the biodiversity and climate crises will still be there when the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted; the ambition of COP15 and COP26 must be carried forward and built upon in 2021.\nRight now, it may be hard not to feel despondent but there are shoots of optimism. After the lockdowns, we may may see greater appreciation for nature in many countries around the world. From China to Spain, people of all ages are missing what they did not know they would miss until they could not have it: craving open spaces; realising the wellbeing and health benefits of accessing nature; and, in many countries, missing the blossoming of spring.\nAdvertisement\nSome improvements in pollution levels have been seen in countries with restricted movements of people and the shutdown of factories and businesses.

Will we now, also, realise how vulnerable a species we actually are?\nI hope that through our experience of this pandemic, we will learn that it is far better to pre-empt a global problem when we see it on the horizon than have to deal with it when it engulfs us. This is a lesson we should apply to the challenge of climate change, which also threatens hundreds of millions of people, as well as that of heeding and listening to the experts. We must also recognise that global challenges require globally coordinated responses.\nAt the end of the year, we will still have a decade to deliver the sustainable development goals, and the biodiversity and climate change COPs – along with other key international meetings – will be rescheduled.\nCrucially, a window of opportunity is opening to ensure that economic recovery plans that countries adopt as they emerge from this crisis are steadfastly “green”. Long-term investment and sustainable economic growth plans should drive climate projects and environmental change. We need nature more than ever, as a solution, as a resource, for respite and for life on Earth.\nLooking ahead, there are opportunities emerging from this pandemic which, if seized, could set the path for a more fruitful 2021 “super year”.

It argues they are interconnected and must be solved simultaneously and “in ways that make none of them worse”.\nThe Commission for the Human Future is an organisation of researchers and citizens focused on global challenges for humanity, including ecological collapse, food insecurity and war and conflict. It was established following a workshop on existential risks held by the Australian National University in 2017 and its members include the formal Liberal party leader John Hewson, who is its chair, public health academics Sharon Friel and Bob Douglas and the climate scientist Mark Howden.\nThe report, published on Wednesday, is the outcome of its first roundtable. Hewson said the global pandemic had brought other risks to civilisation into sharper focus and showed how “vulnerable and unprepared” societies were.\n“At present, no government in the world has a plan for meeting all these risks, for dealing with them as a total system and for finding the best and safest way out of them,” he said. “This lack of preparedness means humanity will continue to be ambushed by unforeseen crises.”\nThe 10 threats are climate change, environmental decline and extinction, nuclear weapons, resource scarcity (including water scarcity), food insecurity, dangerous new technologies, overpopulation, chemical pollution, pandemic disease, and denial and misinformation.\n“What our species does about these 10 existential threats in the next few years will determine whether present and future generations face a safe, sustainable and prosperous future or the prospect of collapse and even extinction,” the report says.\n“It is a choice we all must make, together.”\nIt argues each problem can be addressed by societies working together and proposes a range of solutions including a ban on nuclear weapons, minimum emissions reduction targets of 50% by 2030, a ban on any new fossil fuel projects, universal laws that protect wildlife and endangered species, a shift to a renewable global food system, and efforts to tackle the influence of vested interests on governments.\nIn times of coronavirus and climate change, we must rethink national security\nAllan Behm\nRead more\nThe report says the Covid-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to “rethink society” and the impact humans are having on the planet. It says there is need for widespread policy reform and a focus on building societies focused on natural and ecological security, rather than looking at economic growth as the key indicator of success.\nDr Arnagretta Hunter, the inaugural ANU fellow for the human future and a commission board member, said that while the threats were “grim”, the report had a message of hope.\n“We can turn things around if we can get the right people out in the front, giving the right messages – if we clearly understand the nature and causes of the risks, devise integrated solutions and take early action to defuse them.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock – like Covid-19 – to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.”\nThe new warning reinforces concern sounded by Lola Castro, regional director of WFP for southern Africa, last month. She said the interruption of food programmes for millions of people in the 12 countries that they cover, which have experienced three years of poor harvests because of drought, would have a “critical impact”.\nAs Castro and other experts have made clear, what is occurring as coronavirus begins to bear down on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries is a perfect storm that has seen coronavirus act as an accelerant on a host of well established problems from poverty, the impact of the climate crisis, pre-existing conflict and pre-existing health crises in places with high incidence of diseases like Aids and HIV and malaria.\nPerhaps most pressing, beyond the immediate threat of the disease, is the economic impact in countries less able to deal with the shock, particularly for workers on daily subsistence wages.\nTalking about the situation in southern Africa in an interview with the Guardian last month, Castro described the specific challenges in detail.\n“The lean season has been very, very hard for the last three years with almost no rain and poor harvests which have left 45 million people food insecure with 8.1 million supported by the WFP.”\nUN agencies issue urgent coronavirus appeal after $2bn request falls well short\nRead more\nAlready, as Castro points out, new restrictions on travel, border crossing and the threat of the disease has disrupted ongoing operations even as more people have been pushed towards poverty by lockdowns affecting their ability to work.\n“We are already the region of the world that is the most affected by HIV-Aids. We are having to totally change our distribution models: to reduce concentrations of people at distribution points; to make sure we have hand washing facilities and that people have PPE.\n“Then we have to defeat borders, airlines closing, ports becoming affected, shipping and transport … we are fighting a humungous number of factors today.”\nOther issues have been less visible, but are no less critical, not least any impact on southern Africa’s infrastructure for food supplies which depends on a few keys ports including Durban in South Africa and Beira in Mozambique.\nAnd as Andrew Shepherd of the UK’s Overseas Development Institute explains, the economic impact of coronavirus on the poorest will be felt most sharply.\n“Any food price inflation that is a result of coronavirus will be worst for those who are poorest, especially those who depend on daily wages. One of the impacts of the border closures that we’ve seen is that lots of poor people living along borders subsist on cross-border trading.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

If emissions remain very high, there is a risk the Arctic could be ice-free even in the dark, cold winter months, a possibility described as “catastrophic”.\nThe last global scientific assessment of Arctic ice was in 2013. It predicted a complete loss of ice in the month of September, when it reaches its annual minimum, would occur only if CO2 emissions from human activities remained high. The new results are based on 40 of the latest computer models and is the best assessment to date of the fate of the Arctic ice.\nSince satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has lost 40% of its area and up to 70% of its volume, making it one of the clearest signs of human-caused global heating. In 2019, it shrank to its second lowest extent on record.\nThe loss of the ice exposes the dark ocean, which absorbs more of the sun’s heat and further ramps up temperatures. These changes are also being increasingly linked to more extreme weather including severe winters, deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods at lower latitudes such as in Europe and the US.\n“Alarmingly the models repeatedly show the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean before 2050, almost irrespective of the measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change,” said Ed Blockley, who leads the UK Met Office’s polar climate programme and was one of the team behind the new research. “The signal is there in all possible futures. This was unexpected and is extremely worrying.”\nProf Dirk Notz, at the University of Hamburg, Germany, coordinated the analysis and said: “If we keep global warming below 2C, Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050. This really surprised us.”\n“This is the state-of-the-art in terms of sea ice simulations,” said Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington, US, and not involved in the new study.\nA third of Himalayan ice cap doomed, finds report\nRead more\nThe new research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, uses the latest generation of climate models from 21 research institutes from around the world. In climate studies, the Arctic Ocean is said to be ice-free when it shrinks to fragments with a combined area below 1m sq km, which is 75% lower than in 2019.\nThe models are not perfect and struggle to match closely the ice loss and global warming seen in historical data. “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” Blockley said. “But all the models are clear that the sea ice will continue to decline. At some point, it will be gone, but when that happens is still uncertain.”\nSea ice also varies naturally from year to year, making it hard to predict the date of the first ice-free summer. “There are some models [in which the summer Arctic] goes ice-free in the next few years,” said Blockley. But he cautioned that these are considered outliers and that climate scientists use the combined set of models to calculate the likelihood of events.\nAnother surprising finding from the study is that an ice-free Arctic in the winter months appears possible if CO2 continues to be emitted at high levels. “That’s not something we’ve seen before in these projections,” Blockley said. “A winter ice-free event would be catastrophic, for some wildlife species [like polar bears] for example, that live and hunt around the sea ice.”\nWagner said the loss of Arctic sea ice could have far-reaching consequences, from increasing global heating to harming wildlife: “It also opens up a new ocean for human exploration, from oil and gas extraction, to increased shipping, to increased tourism, each with their own perils and benefits.”\nProf James Screen, at the University of Exeter, UK, said: “It is important to keep in mind that although we might see an ice-free Arctic in all scenarios by 2050, the expected frequency of ice-free summers differs between scenarios. Under a higher emissions scenarios there may be ice-free summers every year, but in lower emissions scenarios they might be occasional.”\nBlockley said the new research showed cutting carbon emissions remained vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic, adding: “We are showing there is still hope.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

Yet despite this grim outlook, scientists, politicians, environment groups and others are tackling the challenges head on.\nBelow are some of the biggest threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today, along with solutions under consideration. Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all.\nSea level rise\nThe threat: By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise up to 31in by 2060, a devastating prediction for a region that already deals regularly with tidal flooding and where an estimated 120,000 properties on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say – it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, according to some studies.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA king tide in Hollywood, Florida. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nPossible solutions: Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the Nature Conservancy have combined their efforts through the south-east regional action climate plan to tackle the crisis. In Miami Beach, dubbed the “ground zero” of sea rise, a multifaceted and costly Rising Above program is already under way. It includes elevating roads, building new sea walls and installing new and higher capacity pumps and drainage systems to alleviate flooding. In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards managed retreat: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, some within two decades.\nThe cost: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach’s $400m Forever Bond, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county’s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage. In the Keys, many consider the estimated $60m a mile cost of raising roads too expensive.\nWater contamination\nThe threat: Saltwater from sea level rise is seeping further inland through Florida’s porous limestone bedrock and contaminating underground freshwater supplies, notably in the Biscayne aquifer, the 4,000-sq mile shallow limestone basin that provides drinking water to millions in southern Florida. Years of over-pumping and toxic runoff from farming and the sugar industry in central Florida and the Everglades have worsened the situation. The Florida department of environmental protection warned in March that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years”. A rising water table, meanwhile, has exacerbated problems with south Florida’s ageing sewage systems. Since December, millions of gallons of toxic, raw sewage have spilled on to Fort Lauderdale’s streets from a series of pipe failures.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Biscayne aquifer square lake between the Everglades and Miami. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nPossible solutions: A comprehensive 30-year Everglades restoration plan was authorized by Congress in 2000 to “restore, preserve and protect” the south Florida ecosystem by improving water flows to help flush the salinity, and a 78bn-gallon Everglades agricultural area reservoir (EAA), a key component of the congressional plan, is earmarked for land once leased by big sugar. The restoration plan, however, has stalled amid funding wrangles, and the storage reservoir plan delayed several times.\nThe cost: The Everglades restoration plan was originally priced at $7.8bn, rose to $10.5bn, and has since ballooned to $16.4bn. Donald Trump’s proposed 2021 federal budget includes $250m for Everglades restoration. The estimated $1.8bn cost of the reservoir will be split between federal and state budgets.\nHurricanes\nThe threat: In October 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the first category 5 cyclone to strike the US since 1992. In the devastating hurricane season just one year before, major storms named Harvey, Maria and Irma combined to cause damage estimated at $265bn. Scientists have evidence the climate crisis is causing cyclones to be more powerful, and intensify more quickly, and Florida’s position at the end of the Atlantic Ocean’s “hurricane alley” makes it twice as vulnerable as any other state.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDamage to the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach after Hurricane Irma. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nPossible solutions: Previous efforts to tame hurricanes were a failure, and experts see mitigation strategies, including more robust building codes, as the best defense. Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed more than 63,000 houses, led to the implementation of a statewide construction code that is updated every three years, though there are regional variations, and criticisms that industry lobbyists have too much sway.\nThe cost: With homeowners and businesses largely bearing their own costs, the specific amount spent on “hurricane-proofing” in Florida is impossible to know. A 2018 Pew research study documented $1.3bn in hazard mitigation grants from federal and state funding in 2017, along with a further $8bn in post-disaster grants. Florida is spending another $633m from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development on resiliency planning.\nWildlife and habitat loss\nThe threat: Florida’s native flora and fauna are being devastated by climate change, with the Florida Natural Areas Inventory warning that a quarter of the 1,200 species it tracks is set to lose more than half their existing habitat, and the state’s beloved manatees and Key deer are at risk of extinction. Warmer and more acidic seas reduce other species’ food stocks and exacerbate the deadly red-tide algal blooms that have killed incalculable numbers of fish, turtles, dolphins and other marine life. Bleaching and stony coral tissue disease linked to the climate crisis threaten to hasten the demise of the Great Florida Reef, the only living coral reef in the continental US. Encroaching saltwater has turned Big Pine Key, a crucial deer habitat, into a ghost forest.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA ghost forest by the Everglades. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nPossible solutions: The diverse range of challenges requires a piecemeal approach. A state and federally funded “Noah’s ark” is collecting and preserving coral chunks at venues including Nova Southeastern University as disease research continues. A new state taskforce of marine scientists and biologists is tackling the blue-green algae outbreaks that have choked Florida’s inland waterways. As for the Key deer, of which fewer than 1,000 remain, volunteers leave clean drinking water to replace salt-contaminated watering holes as herds retreat to higher ground. A longer-term debate is under way on the merits and ethics of relocating the species to other areas of Florida or the US.\nThe cost: Florida is spending $4m in the current financial year for expanded water quality analytics related to “nutrient over-enrichment” and $3m annually for the next five years on Red Tide research. A 20-year project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to restore 3m sq feet of the Great Florida Reef is estimated at $100m. Such projects can only scratch the surface of the incalculable investment that will be needed to save the states species and their habitats.\nCoastal erosion\nThe threat: Tourist brochures showcase miles of golden, sandy beaches in South Florida, but the reality is somewhat different. The Florida department of environmental protection deems the entire coastline from Miami to Cape Canaveral “critically eroded”, the result of sea level rise, historically high tides and especially storm surges from a succession of powerful hurricanes. In south-eastern Florida’s Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, authorities are waging a continuous war on sand loss, eager to maintain their picture-perfect image and protect two of their biggest sources of income, tourism dollars and lucrative property taxes from waterfront homes and businesses.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFederally funded imported sand is used as one of mitigation measures against the climate crisis. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nPossible solutions: With the other option abandoning beaches to the elements, city and county commissions have little choice but costly replenishment projects with sand replacement and jetty construction. Federal law prohibits the importation of cheaper foreign sand, so the municipalities must source a more expensive alternative from US markets, often creating friction with residents who don’t want to part with their sand. Supplementary to sand replenishment, the Nature Conservancy is a partner in a number of nature-based coastal defense projects from West Palm Beach to Miami.\nThe cost: Authorities usually match federal funding for replenishment projects. An $8m project restored almost 125,000 cubic yards to three Broward county beaches last winter, and $55m will be spent on a 400,000-sq yd restoration on three others beginning in the fall. The region’s showpiece, Miami Beach, benefited from 61,000 cubic yards of new sand this year at a cost of $16m. Statewide, Florida spends an average $50m annually on beach erosion.\nClimate gentrification\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA front yard in Little Haiti. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nThe threat: “Climate gentrification” is a buzzword around south Florida, a region barely 6ft above sea level where land has become increasingly valuable in elevated areas. Speculators and developers are eyeing historically black, working-class and poorer areas, pushing out long-term residents and replacing affordable housing with upscale developments and luxury accommodations that only the wealthy can afford. In Miami, the controversial Magic City Innovation District in the neighborhood of Little Haiti is a billion-dollar, 17-acre, towering behemoth blending commercial, residential, entertainment and hotel space. It has drawn legal action from locals who say their rights have been trampled.\nPossible solutions: Experts argue there are ways to lessen the impact of climate gentrification on local populations without the need for displacement, such as providing affordable working space and housing for existing residents, and using sustainable construction practices and environmentally friendly materials. Magic City’s developers insist they are committed to the neighborhood, including below-market-cost housing. Local authorities and activist groups are working to “protect” areas by investing in revitalization and affordable housing projects.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nConstruction bordering the Everglades. Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova\nThe cost: No study has yet calculated the overall cost of affordable housing lost to the climate crisis. Private developers will bear the expense of mitigating the impact on the neighborhood – $31m in Magic City’s case over 15 years to the Little Haiti Revitalization Trust, largely for new “green” affordable housing. The University of Miami’s housing solutions lab has a $300,000 grant from JPMorgan to report on the impact of rising seas to South Florida’s affordable housing stocks and recommend modifications to prevent it from flooding and other climate events. A collaboration of not-for-profit groups is chasing $75m in corporate funding for affordable housing along the 70-mile south Florida rail trail from Miami to West Palm Beach, with the first stage, a $5m project under way to identify, build and renovate 300 units.\nPolitics\nThe threat: Florida has long been plagued by political leadership more in thrall to the interests of big industry than the environment. As governor from 2011 to 2019, Rick Scott, now a US senator, slashed $700m from Florida’s water management budget, rolled back environmental regulations and enforcement, gave a free ride to polluters, and flip-flopped over expanding offshore oil drilling. The politician who came to be known as “Red Tide Rick”, for his perceived inaction over 2018’s toxic algae bloom outbreaks, reportedly banned the words “climate change” and “global warming” from state documents.\nPossible solutions: It’s too soon for deep deliberations on Scott’s successor, fellow Republican Ron DeSantis, but in little more than a year in office he has made several moves that surprised environmentalists. He appointed Florida’s first chief science officer, created an algae taskforce, struck a deal to prevent drilling in parts of the Everglades, and won a tussle with Florida’s legislature to expand an ambitious land acquisition and preservation program. Last month, state legislators approved the first dedicated climate bill. It appears a promising start for a new administration, but activists say more needs to be done. In January, the Sierra Club awarded DeSantis failing grades in an environmental report card, saying he failed to protect Florida’s springs and rivers and approved new roads that threatened protected wildlife.\nThe cost: Florida’s spending on the environment is increasing. The state budget passed last month included $650m for Everglades restoration and water management projects (an instalment of DeSantis’s $2.5bn four-year pledge) and $100m for Florida Forever. A $100m bridge project jointly funded by the state and federal governments will allow the free flow of water under the Tamiami Trail for the first time in decades.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nView of Miami Beach and Fisher Island from water.

It is estimated 96% of the carbon dioxide released then had been absorbed in regrowth by 2019. But the report notes rising climate change impacts, including droughts or more frequent and intense fires, could affect the ability of forests to recover.\nScott Morrison says the government is acting on emissions. Is it true?\nRead more\nOther scientists have been less optimistic about the capacity of Australian forests to reabsorb all emissions released during bushfires, warning under normal conditions it could take decades for enough regrowth to occur and the climate crisis was increasing the risk of repeat fires within shorter timeframes.\nBy 11 February, the 2019-20 fires had burned 7.4m hectares of temperate forest, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria.\nThe report makes clear the area affected is unprecedented. The graph below, based on historical and satellite data, suggests 50% more burned than in any previous year dating back to 1850.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAnnual area burnt by bushfires in Australian temperate forests Photograph: Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources\nMore than 40% of the area burned, an estimated 3.14m hectares, lies within national parks. Another 1.86m hectares is labelled “other conservation and natural environments”.\nAbout 1.8m hectares is described as “production native forests” – state forests available for logging by the timber industry.\nThe data does not include woodlands and grasslands in northern and central Australia, which tend to burn to some extent every year, in part through traditional Indigenous land management.\nFires in these parts of the country tend to burn a much larger area each year, but the net emissions and impact on people and wildlife is less than that in temperate forests in the southeast. There is less fuel and carbon sequestration due to regrowth is considered to usually balance emissions from new fires.\nThe report says bushfire emissions are expected to have little impact on whether Australia meets its targets under the Kyoto and Paris climate agreements. Pollution from national disturbances are considered beyond human control are not counted under UN greenhouse accounting rules.\nIt says the recovery of the forest is expected to be “complete”. “However, the department will actively monitor the forest recovery from the bushfires to ensure that any future human disturbances, such as salvage logging, future fire disturbance and the impacts of changes in climate are taken into account,” it says.\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nThe report does not consider bushfire damage beyond emissions, including the impact on hundreds of species. In the immediate aftermath of the fires, a government analysis found 113 species needed urgent attention, estimating at least 30% of their habitat had been burnt. In Victoria, it is estimated about 70% of the state’s remaining warm temperate rainforest and more than half the habitat of at least 170 rare and threatened species was affected.\nAustralia emits about 530m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. The most recent government greenhouse gas data suggests the country is not on track to meet its 2030 target, a 26% to 28% cut below 2005, without the use of an accounting loophole. Analysts say Australia should be aiming to do far more than its current target if it is to play its part in meeting the goals set in Paris.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A green stimulus plan can tackle both","paragraph":"T\nhe Covid-19 epidemic is ravaging our tattered healthcare system and shredding our economy. In the past month, over 22 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, compounding the fear that unemployment could breach 32% absent massive public action. This is an unmitigated human disaster, recalling the horrors of the Great Depression. And it gets worse. We’re also facing the climate emergency. Immediate relief is necessary – but not sufficient. To tackle all these crises at once, we need a Green Stimulus that creates jobs and lifts up communities in ways that also slash carbon pollution, increase resiliency, and develop a just, modern economy.\nNo one can predict when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump will turn their full attention to economic recovery. But behind the scenes, the planning has already begun. It’s not a question of whether we spend big on stimulus, but what kind of stimulus.\nAnd while Republicans will decry anything “green”, we can win the argument. But much of what we propose already has bipartisan support, from polling to pending legislation.\nClimate change is about to supercharge the coronavirus emergency. In April, California’s wildfire season will start. Restrictions on work caused by the pandemic will make it harder for firefighters to conduct controlled burns that steer fires – and smoke – from homes. Californians’ lungs could face Covid-19 and unusually intense smoke at the same time. A third of the country also faces serious flood risk through the spring. And in summer and fall, forecasters predict “above average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States”. We’re already seeing this catastrophic convergence elsewhere: In Ecuador, a muted government response to flooding in indigenous communities, for fear of spreading the virus; in Fiji, devastated by Cyclone Harold this week, 19 confirmed coronavirus cases are casting doubt on how to rebuild.\nHere too, we will need to find ways to do the needed relief work without deepening the pandemic. Amid all this suffering, the case for bold moves to tackle the miseries of inequality, Covid, and climate at once will get clearer.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMoreover, green stimulus is the only option for a smooth transition to the 21st century green economy. The era of dirty energy is ending. Even the conservative CBNC analyst Jim Cramer has warned investors that oil stocks are no longer safe investments, as society is increasingly repudiating fossil fuels. Giant investors like Blackrock are gradually winding down their investments in carbon. And at the European level, and in countries like Germany and South Korea, a green stimulus-based recovery is becoming the consensus choice, with investments in efficiency and clean energy seen as obvious drivers of economic reconstruction.\nHere in the US, green stimulus is easily the best way to create good jobs through public investment. According to a 2011 World Bank study, $1m invested in the oil and gas in the United States creates just five jobs, compared to 17 jobs per million dollars invested in energy-saving building retrofits, 22 jobs for mass transit, 13 for wind, and 14 for solar. Kammen’s research and that of other institutes all concur that investment in a modern green economy is a more efficient job creator than the fossil sector.\nThe longer-term vision of the green stimulus is a more rewarding, lifelong career of dignified green work. We should also invest in Stem education for all children and create apprenticeship programs in vulnerable communities, matched with new careers for workers to enter. And by directly investing in frontline communities, following best practices in California, we can bring technologies like solar and battery storage to neighborhoods that have been scandalously left out of the clean energy boom so far. Plus, these same nimble, local solutions make neighborhoods more resilient to extreme weather. Local storage and nested microgrids make the power system, including healthcare facilities, more reliable during disasters. We’d be making environmental, economic, and social improvements in the same places, at the same time.\nAnd we should speak of green investments in concrete terms. Polling conducted by Data for Progress in March finds majority support for massive green spending overall. More interesting is the finding of even greater support – including majority Republican approval – for specific public green investments, like electric buses, retrofits to low-income housing, and renewable energy. Strip away abstract rhetoric, and the substance that we’re advocating is incredibly popular.\nFor these reasons, we recently joined nine other experts in social and climate policy to write a letter to Congress outlining a menu of policy options for a Green Stimulus. Our proposals span eight sectors of the economy. But fundamentally, a Green Stimulus is about mobilizing massive public funds – say, $2tn to start – in specific green investments to create high-quality jobs and improve the quality of life, especially in low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, which have suffered the most disinvestment and pollution in recent decades.\nIt seems counterintuitive, but the timing for such a Green Stimulus is perfect. Bridge-loans and advance payments on public green purchases of goods like solar panels and electric vehicles for public use would stabilize firms’ and workers’ finances. Announcing initiatives like a Climate Conservation Corps would give young people eager to work jobs to apply for, and plan to start. And desk workers across the economy could get on Zoom and do paperwork to make green projects shovel-ready the minute it’s safe to break ground. (Indeed, a major reason the 2009 Obama stimulus faltered was months wasted on paperwork.)\nEach of us has lived through climate-fueled disasters – in Cohen’s case, Hurricane Sandy, and in Kammen’s, last year’s devastating wildfires. We agree with the environmental justice advocates who argued then that disaster recovery shouldn’t be about trying to bounce back to how things were before the disaster. We don’t want to bounce back to a January 2020 economy when half the country lived paycheck to paycheck; unchecked carbon pollution endangered our future; and racial inequalities made people of color so vulnerable to disease. Rather, by deploying a Green Stimulus that centers workers and communities, we can bounce forward together.\nDaniel Aldana Cohen is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2, and is a co-author of A Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal\nDaniel Kammen is professor at the University of California, Berkeley, coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and former Science Envoy for the United States Department of State\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Not if you can afford it","paragraph":"Boston has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities.\nNow Boston faces its most existential threat yet – the rising seas.\nIronically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston’s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise – in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities.\nThe economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis.\n“It is an unfortunate quirk of timing,” admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site.\nCity authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 – a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston.\nHistorical risk\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe seeds of Boston’s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston’s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands.\nThe core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline – a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world’s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, according to the World Bank.\nAdvertisement\nThe sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA Boston firefighter wades through flood waters on the Long Wharf. City authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070. Photograph: Michael Dwyer/AP\nAdvertisement\nDevelopers in Boston are attempting to stare down this challenge, however. Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated.\nBut Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it – an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor’s first “living shoreline” – a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides.\nYou get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor.\nSeawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown.\n“We’ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,” Iselin said. “In four or five years you’ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape.\nAdvertisement\n“I think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it’s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.”\nThe developers haven’t left too much to chance – Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Photograph: Ed Wonsek Art Works Inc\nThese adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible.\nA more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m.\nThese new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the “perception of gentrification is very real”, Iselin conceded.\n‘We are a hub of immigrants’\nAdvertisement\nBoston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis – its Climate Ready Boston plan sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms – but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements.\nThe city has had one near miss – Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won’t be so lucky next time.\n“Where I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient – all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,” said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group the Harborkeepers who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. “The question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?”\nOriginally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston’s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston’s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nApartments at Clippership Wharf cost about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m. Photograph: Ed Wonsek Art Works Inc\nAdvertisement\n“Boston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants – Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,” Ayed said. “That’s still the case but it’s changing. I don’t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can’t. I probably won’t be able to ever afford it.”\nAyed said that Lendlease “deserves a lot of credit” for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she’s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt.\n“The bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,” Ayed said. “The whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.”\nRed Hook: the hip New York enclave caught between gentrification and climate change\nRead more\nLeadership\nBoston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn’t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city’s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved.\nThe task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America’s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground.\n“As we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,” said Christopher Cook, Boston’s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them.\n“Success is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can’t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won’t have been successful.”\nEven for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this?\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBoston isn’t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront.

There is no overarching federal government strategy to deal with sea level rise, a phenomena that’s on course to displace an astounding 13 million Americans, according to a University of Georgia in Athens study, with the Trump administration dismantling the few federal requirements to build with the climate crisis in mind.\n“The challenge is enormous, so much so that it could be paralyzing,” said Cook. “We’ve taken on challenges over time, though, and this is just the next stage in this.\n“But we do need strong federal leadership – frankly we needed it 10 years ago. Washington DC needs to focus on protecting coastal cities, because a lot of them don’t have the flexibility we do.”\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

In the half century since, climate change has emerged as an existential global threat.\nBut there are still reasons to be hopeful – and this week, the Guardian is joining forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency, from electric cars to fighting plastic waste to using psychedelic drugs. (Michael Pollan will weigh in.) We’ll also explore lessons from the coronavirus pandemic – and whether the economic crash could create opportunities to rebuild a greener economy.\nNorway and the A-ha moment that made electric cars the answer\nRead more\nThe Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded last year by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation to address the urgent need for stronger climate coverage. More than 400 newsrooms from around the world – with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people – have signed on.\nIn the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we’ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week.\nAdvertisement\nThe Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world.\nThe Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian announced it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels. Last year, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favors the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” over “climate change”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe Guardian last year also began putting global CO2 levels in the daily weather forecast in its print publication.\nCovering Climate Now was launched to address a glaring failure by the media to meet the urgency of the climate emergency. Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, “broadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth”.\nIn 2019, that started to change. “The climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,” Pope writes. “Floods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.”\nWhile the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

Eventually, the authorities impounded their car and auctioned it off to cover the fines.\nBut the stunt attracted massive media attention, and the point was made. Soon after, electric vehicles were exempted from road tolls, one of a large raft of incentives that have, over the years, helped make Norway the country with the world’s highest per capita electric vehicle ownership.\nLast month, in an economy hit by the coronavirus crisis, fully electric cars accounted for just under 60% of Norway’s new car market, and plug-in hybrids just over 15% – meaning three in four of all new cars sold were either wholly or partly electric.\nIt still has some way to go, but the country looks on course to meet a government target – set in 2016, with full cross-party parliamentary support – of phasing out the sale of all new fossil-fuel based cars and light commercial vehicles by 2025.\n“It’s actually quite amazing how fast the mindset’s changed,” said Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Electric Vehicle Association. “Even in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric.”\nThe story of how and why that has happened has a straightforward, if unexpected logic. First, despite being a major oil and gas producer, almost all of Norway’s domestic energy comes from a single, and renewable, source: hydropower.\nEven in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric\nChristina Bu of the Norwegian EV Association\nThat means switching to EVs is a much greener option for Norway than for countries whose power is generated mostly by coal plants – and that if it wants to significantly reduce its emission levels, it has little choice but to green its transport sector.\nDriven by the environmental imperative, the government began offering incentives to buy and run electric cars as far back as 1990, first by introducing a temporary exemption from Norway’s exorbitant vehicle purchase tax, which became permanent six years later.\n“This was an important step,” Bu said. “Norway was a very poor country before we discovered oil; cars were a luxury item. They’ve always been taxed very highly. Cars in Norway are a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Without the purchase tax, the cost of an electric car basically fell to that of an ordinary car.”\nSince then, electric car drivers have been given the right to park for free in some municipal car parks, drive in bus lanes, take ferries without a ticket and, thanks to A-ha, drive toll-free. They are not required to pay VAT on their cars, or road tax, and company electric cars are taxed at a lower rate than petrol or diesel vehicles.\nAdvertisement\nSome measures have changed over the years: to be allowed to drive in a bus lane, for example, you now need to be carrying a passenger. A so-called 50% rule was introduced in 2017, allowing local authorities to charge EV drivers up to 50% of the parking fees, road tolls and ferry rates applicable to fossil-fuel vehicles.\nBut overall, said Bu, the “combination of a big one-off saving when you buy the car, plus the substantially lower costs – fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance – of actually driving it, still adds up to a very powerful financial argument. Over its lifetime, you really save a lot of money with an electric car in Norway.”\nThat was certainly what persuaded Wenche Charlotte Egelund, 57, who bought a VW Golf Electric with her partner two years ago when they moved out of central Oslo. “The incentives were crucial,” she said. “The tax and VAT exemptions, free municipal parking, free toll roads that mean we avoid the rush-hour traffic jams.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nEV charging stations at Kongens Gate near Akershus Festning in Oslo. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\nIn fact, Egelund said, the incentives were so significant that she almost “felt the decision was imposed on me. Financially, it was like there was no other sensible option. I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?”\nHow green are electric cars?\nRead more\nRachel Ritman, 56, a postwoman living on the outskirts of Fredrikstad, bought her Opel Ampera two years ago and said she has not regretted her choice, even if she was “not sure we would have gone electric without the incentives”. The car’s range was good, she said: 250 miles (400km) in summer, 200 miles (320km) in winter and because she charges at home she does not suffer from “lade-angst”, or the fear of running out of juice.\nBoth Ritman and Egelund have a second, diesel-powered car for extra-long journeys, to country cabins or holidays. Sten Bråthen, 55, a media consultant, bought his Nissan Leaf as a second car “for taking the children around and driving to work. But there were so many advantages that when we were getting a new main car last year we didn’t think twice about going electric.”\nGovernment incentives were vital in the decision to buy, Bråthen said: “I think we would have managed without the other incentives – free toll roads and parking – but the actual cost of buying was so much lower than ordinary cars here in Norway.” He warned, though, that Norway was going to need more charging stations.\nDespite the incentives, EV sales in Norway remained low until about 2010, when a number of smaller, more affordable electric cars from makers such as Mitsubishi and Nissan came to market, and improved technology meant larger electric cars began to offer both the space and range to make them a sensible choice for families.\nI do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?\nWenche Charlotte Egelund, car buyer\nBu said the incentives were so significant that “many people say they’ve bought the most expensive car they’ve ever had when they buy electric – Teslas, Jaguars, that kind of model – simply because they’ve calculated what kind of saving they’re going to be making over the coming years, and feel it makes sense”.\nThat has led to accusations that Norway’s encouragement of electric vehicles amounts to little more than tax cuts for the rich, or a cut-price second car. Many Norwegians on lower incomes can only dream of owning an electric car, and three out of four car purchases are on the secondhand market.\nBu – whose organisation represents consumers rather than producers – rejected this, arguing that “we have to change the cars we drive, and the only way to do that is to change the new cars. We can’t change used ones”. EVs will soon make up 10% of Norway’s passenger fleet, she said, and are slowly coming on to the used market.\nShe said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO2 emissions as petrol cars.\n“As a society, we clearly have to do two things,” she said. “Produce more renewable energy and products – like cars – that can run on it,” she said. “We have to do both, as fast as possible. We can’t hang around until we’re producing 100% renewable energy.”\nElectric cars are “never going to be truly environmentally friendly”, Bu said. “The main problem is making the batteries. We need clean battery producers in Europe. But look, we need transport. We need cars and vans, particularly outside our cities. And for us, electric is the answer.”\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.”\nOn its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef.\nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?\nRead more\nIt’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder.\nSome 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs.\nThe program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:\nShading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures;\nStabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification;\nHelping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse.\nSo what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?\nShading and cooling the Great Barrier Reef\nIn early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, led a trial of equipment that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air.\nAdvertisement\nThe idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets.\nThe process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds.\nHarrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching.\nSuch a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress.\nHarrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nScientists have carried out a trial of prototype cloud brightening equipment on the Great Barrier Reef.

Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas.\n“This is a race against time,” he said. “If we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris [climate] targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future – but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.”\nStabilising damaged reefs with scaffolding\nAnyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre.\nCoral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs.\nThere are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover.\nRemoving natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation.\nModelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGreat Barrier Reef coral bleached in the most recent event. Photograph: JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA/AFP via Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nAnthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches.\n“It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says.\n“At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.”\nTransporting corals and larvae\nProf Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons.\n“It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says.\nOne approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover.\nHarrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, “it didn’t matter if 99% [of the larvae] drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.”\n“Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.”\nSnow-white coral of once-vibrant Great Barrier Reef a sign urgent action must be taken\nAdam Morton\nRead more\nHarrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs.\nCorals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae.\nCombining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”.\n“We think we can get an increased tolerance [of corals] of just a few degrees. Ultimately, unless the political leadership round the world enables a realistic approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing the rate of climate change under control, the system will become so overwhelmed we won’t be able to use these corals.\n“We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change.

Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.\nWidespread travel restrictions around the world have slashed demand for air travel, with more than eight in 10 flights canceled. But there is a disparity in the US – while the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported a 96% slump in passenger volume, to a level not seen since 1954, this hasn’t been matched by the number of flights being scrapped.\nSlightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\n“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”\nThis situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.\nIn March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nIn this photo provided by Represenative Dusty Johnson, Johnson takes a selfie with House colleagues on a mostly empty plane on 27 March. Photograph: Dusty Johnson/AP\nThe aviation industry accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions, although this is concentrated among the small fraction of the world’s population that regularly flies. The reduction in flights is expected to reduce pollution levels, with emissions from the sector dropping by almost a third last month, the Financial Times has reported.\nHowever, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.\n“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”\nAdvertisement\nThe US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.\nThe economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.\nAccording to Airlines for America, an industry group, more than a third of the US fleet, about 2,400 aircraft, have been parked, with airlines burning through cash at more than $10bn a month as cancellations “far outpace” new bookings.

Environmental campaigners describe some participants in these industries as “coronavirus profiteers”.\nEconomic and energy leaders say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a safer, more resilient, world. However, such action has been lacking to date, they warn.\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “When I look at different parts of the world I have not seen yet a major emphasis on clean-energy technologies.” He warned of mistakes similar to those made after the 2008 financial crisis when stimulus packages led to the biggest leap in carbon emissions in 50 years, four times greater than the reduction initially seen.\n“If we put the money in the right place, we can manage the [climate] risk, and have a much more modern, cleaner and safer energy system,” Birol told the Guardian. “But if you put the money in the wrong place we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets.”\nThe Guardian view on the climate and coronavirus: global warnings\nRead more\nRachel Kyte, at Tufts University, US, a former UN special representative for energy and former World Bank Group vice president, said: “Covid-19 puts our economies at a fork in the road. Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn’t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn’t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it’s dangerous.”\nUnlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery.\nFrans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the Green Deal at the European commission, said: “[Tackling the Covid-19 emergency] cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity’s most daunting challenges.”\n“Bailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.”\nThe nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery.\nLaurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: “We know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.”\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nLord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: “The nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.” But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors.\nMichael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. “As governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy … no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.”\nBen Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. “But so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.”\nThe course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. “I think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.”\nTimmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets.\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, was clear about the need to rebuild a different global economy. “Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

The monetary policy committee (MPC) at Threadneedle Street hopes purchases of £200bn in government and corporate bonds from banks will encourage those institutions to lend the proceeds elsewhere in the UK economy, while also holding down borrowing costs for companies.\nHowever, activists said the continued inclusion of some of the biggest polluters in history was incompatible with the government’s aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nPositive Money, a campaign group, said the purchases of oil company bonds broke the promises of Andrew Bailey, the new Bank of England governor, who last month told MPs there was a “very strong argument” for excluding fossil fuel companies from the purchases.\nBailey said looking at the exclusion of fossil fuel companies would be a priority for the Bank, but noted any exclusion would require the consent of the government.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAndrew Bailey said there was a ‘very strong argument’ for excluding fossil fuel companies from bond purchases.\nAdvertisement\nFran Boait, the executive director of Positive Money, said the Bank must stop buying bonds from fossil fuel companies and consider excluding firms whose business models were not in line with the Paris climate agreement and the government’s 2050 net zero target.\n“Corporate QE is another subsidy for multinational companies and is not necessary to save the economy or save lives,” she said. “There is no need for our response to the coronavirus crisis to harm our response to the climate crisis.”\nQuick guide\nUK government support for workers and businesses during the coronavirus crisis\nShow\nIncome subsidies\nDirect cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month.

Several other researchers, including an EmiControls representative, were unable to join the crew as planned because of Covid-19 travel restrictions.\nA separate vessel 5km away carrying atmospheric modelling equipment was able to detect the mist created by the prototype. Future experiments will measure if the salt particles do brighten clouds.\nThe cloud-brightening approach is just one of 43 concepts being funded under a $150m government-backed research and development program announced on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nScientists are racing to find measures that could be used to reduce the impact of rising ocean temperatures on corals caused by global heating.\nIn 2020, the Great Barrier Reef experienced its third outbreak of mass coral bleaching in five years. Tropical coral reefs are especially sensitive to global heating. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says 70-90% of coral reefs will die as global heating gets to 1.5C.\nHarrison said the technology, deployed in March under a permit from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, had promise because it was relatively cheap, could be deployed at scale and kick-started a process that occurs naturally.\n“Nature does most of the work for you,” he said. “This makes a nano-sized salt crystal at hundreds of trillions per second. They get into a cloud and grow a cloud droplet that reflects a lot more sunlight.”\nHarrison said the technique was effectively boosting a natural process, because clouds mostly form over the ocean when moisture gathers around salt crystals stirred up by winds from the ocean surface.\nHe said while a cloud of mist was visible off the back of the boat, about 99% of the particles created by the nozzles were too small to see. However, they could be detected by atmospheric measuring equipment on the accompanying vessel.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA trial on the Great Barrier Reef of cloud brightening equipment. Photograph: Brendan Kelaher/Southern Cross University\n“We thought we might only be able to detect it a couple of kilometres downwind, but we detected it 5km downwind,” Harrison said.\nScientists on the barge said they could see corals “bleaching around us” as they carried out the experiment.\nHarrison and the core team drove 3,600km north to Townsville from Coffs Harbour, and back, camping and preparing their own food along the way to remain isolated from others not involved in the project as Covid-19 travel restrictions began to be rolled out.\nFuture research will also examine any downstream risks from the technique, and any local impacts on rainfall.\nManduburra traditional owner Usop Drahm, who joined the expedition, said: “We welcome scientific research where Indigenous people and the rest of Australia work together to maintain the reef ecosystem for future generations.\n“This technology might help prevent bleaching and we like that it uses no chemicals and relies on natural processes.”\nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?\nRead more\nHarrison said while the trial was not set up to detect if clouds had been brightened, “the theory says [the particles] would have mixed up to the heights of low-level clouds about 800 metres up”.\nThe salt crystals would have remained in the air for only one or two days in the initial experiment, he said. The approach does not make clouds, but brightens those already in the atmosphere.\nThere are plans to scale up the experiment using more and larger turbines so that their output is about 10 times larger.\nThis, Harrison said, could cover an area of hundreds of square kilometres – a scale large enough to slightly cool ocean temperatures.\nWithin four years, Harrison said, it was hoped the project would show a brightening response in the clouds.\nBut he said the success of such projects would depend on action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nHe said as temperatures went up, the cloud brightening technique became less and less effective at protecting corals from mass bleaching.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Or pangolins. To hear common narratives about the origins of Covid-19, there is a simple causal relationship between China’s consumption of wild animals and the coronavirus ravaging the globe.\nDr Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top epidemiologist, told Fox: “It boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we don’t just shut it down.” His opinion echoes a growing chorus across the political spectrum that singles out China’s so-called “wet markets” as the culprit for the pandemic. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called the Chinese exotic animal trade “disgusting” and conservationist Jane Goodall has called for “a global ban”.\nScience and political economy, however, tell a more complex story. The principal driver of zoonotic diseases (such as the virus Sars-Cov-2, which spread from animals to humans) is industrial animal agriculture. When food production encroaches on wild habitats, it creates opportunities for pathogens to jump to livestock and humans. Industrial agriculture also breeds its own diseases, like swine flu and avian flu, on hellish factory farms. And it contributes to antibiotic resistance and climate change, both of which exacerbate the problem.\nWe need to have an honest public discussion on how to produce our food. Individually, we must stop eating animal products. Collectively, we must transform the global food system and work toward ending animal agriculture and rewilding much of the world. Oddly, many people who would never challenge the reality of climate change refuse to acknowledge the role meat-eating plays in endangering public health. Eating meat, it seems, is a socially acceptable form of science denial.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nResearchers have long issued warnings about the consequences of our livestock-dominated food system. After the Sars outbreak in 2003, an essay in the American Journal of Public Health lamented that “changing the way humans treat animals – most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten – is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure.” In 2016, the UN Environment Program warned that the “livestock revolution” was a zoonotic disaster waiting to happen.\nYet meat consumption continues to rise. Now, just as experts predicted, eating animals is coming back to bite us.\nXenophobes call Covid-19 the “Wuhan virus”, but in reality zoonoses emerge worldwide, and do so with increasing regularity. The 1918 “Spanish flu” probably came from a midwestern pig farm. In the 1990s, ecological destabilization in the US south-west led to the Four Corners hantavirus outbreak. The Hendra and Menangle viruses are named after Australian towns. The Reston virus is an Ebola strain named after a DC suburb. Marburg virus emerged in Germany. These last two diseases sprang from monkeys imported for laboratory use – the Chinese are not the only ones with a large and dangerous wildlife trade. Sars, Mers and Zika are only three of many novel zoonoses to strike in the new millennium.\nFauci, Graham and Goodall’s call for a clampdown on the “exotic” animal trade is a valid demand, but ignores how that industry is inextricably intertwined with “conventional” food production. The Chinese government has encouraged smallholders to breed and procure wild game to compensate for losing market-share to large livestock firms. Similarly, reliance on “bush meat” in west Africa increased after local fishers were pushed out of coastal waters by foreign trawlers in the 1970s, leading to the outbreaks of HIV and Ebola. The problem isn’t some people’s taste for seemingly strange delicacies, but rather our global, profit-driven, meat-centered food system.\nJust as zoonotic threats are multiplying, combating them is becoming harder. Antibiotics are increasingly ineffective in part because commercial livestock farmers abuse them, hoping to speed up growth rates or as a prophylactic measure against the spread of disease on overcrowded factory farms. Overuse of antibiotics spurs the evolution of “super-bugs” like MRSA, a flesh-eating bacterium now found at hospitals worldwide. Modern solutions, like viral cures and vaccines, are elusive. The World Health Organization reported that the most important techniques for controlling the 2003 Sars outbreak were not cutting-edge medicines so much as “19th-century public health strategies of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation”. This has also been the case with Covid-19.\nOur short-term priority is the development of a vaccine for Covid-19. But we must also start thinking about more radical measures to address the roots of this crisis. We need a more resilient food system that puts less stress on the planet and on public health.\nThis requires three interventions. The first is ending subsidies to industrial animal agriculture and taxing animal products to incorporate the cost of environmental and public health externalities, with the aim of the industry’s eventual abolition.\nThe second is support for local, sustainable plant farming to replace the monocrop-focused status quo. We must relieve pressure on soil and wildlife while creating better, safer agricultural jobs. (We should also remember that meatpacking workers, like their peers in wet markets, tend to be the first exposed to new pathogens.)\nThe third is large-scale, public-directed investment in both plant-based meat alternatives and cellular agriculture (ie, growing animal tissue from stem cells), which would expand scientific research and employment while spurring a transition to animal-free protein.\nThe post-meat age will be a healthier one. Between farming, ranching and feed crops, the livestock industry gobbles up 40% of the world’s habitable surface. A vegan food system would require a tenth as much land. Restoring the natural environment could also create jobs through a public works program akin to the New Deal’s Civilian Conservation Corps. And it would reduce the outbreak of new epidemics by reducing contact between humans and wild animals and by restoring biodiversity.\nOld habits can change. In the last few weeks, as the coronavirus has spread and millions shelter in place, bean sales have surged. People, it seems, are willing to eat legumes if it’s part of a public health effort. When this pandemic ends they’ll need to keep doing just that, lest a more lethal disaster comes to pass.\nJan Dutkiewicz is the Connie Caplan postdoctoral fellow in the department of political science at Johns Hopkins University\nAstra Taylor is the author, most recently, of Democracy May Not Exist, but We’ll Miss It When It’s Gone\nTroy Vettese is an environmental historian and a William Lyon Mackenzie King research fellow at Harvard University\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

But that does not take into account the “invisible” side of Britain’s carbon footprint, which comes from international travel and the carbon produced overseas to make goods that are used here.\nAbout half of Britain’s true carbon footprint is made up of these sources, according to a report from the conservation charity WWF.\nEmissions associated with imports to the UK, including international travel, have risen from about 316m tonnes of carbon in 1990 to 360m tonnes in 2016 and 358m tonnes in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. These imported emissions can vary substantially from year to year, but have been broadly steady or rising, though they are down from a peak of 449m in 2007, before the financial crisis.\nOver the same period, between 1990 and 2016, the UK’s own carbon emissions fell by more than 40%, thanks mainly to a long switch away from coal-fired power to gas and renewable sources of electricity, according to the report published on Thursday.\nThe carbon associated with the manufacture of imported goods appears in the carbon accounts of the manufacturing country. However, some countries have less stringent carbon targets than others, and developing countries may struggle to use low-carbon methods as they pursue economic growth. International aviation is not covered by countries’ national carbon targets, under the UN climate talks and the Paris agreement.\n“If all other countries were going for net zero too, then this [invisible carbon footprint] wouldn’t be a problem,” said the author of the report, John Barrett, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds. “The UK should be showing leadership.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nPolicies to ensure that goods allowed to be imported had a lower carbon footprint – such as requirements on the efficiency, repairability and recycling of electric and electronic goods – could have a major impact on the invisible side of Britain’s carbon footprint, he added. Exporters would have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint and the emissions associated with using their goods.\nOther changes to people’s habits could also bear fruit, for instance, encouraging a move to a healthier diet with more vegetables and less meat could change food imports and the carbon associated with them, said Barrett.\nThe question of how to account for the emissions associated with imports is a vexed and polarising one, with some green campaigners arguing that developed countries should accept responsibility for emissions generated overseas, while other economists point out that the manufacturing countries have been paid for the goods.\nJosh Burke, a policy fellow at the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Using consumption accounting to understand trade flows is a useful exercise in light of the current global disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical tensions that have seen trade walls erected. Policies to shift consumption patterns and lower imports emissions – such as border carbon adjustments – are an elegant economic solution, based on equity and efficiency, rather than protectionism.”\nThe EU is considering such border adjustments – in effect, carbon taxes on imports – to take into account the carbon generated by their manufacture, as part of its European green deal. But this is complex, said Burke. Such policies “tend to get bogged down in the politics of implementation and discussions often get sucked backed into protectionist agendas. As the UK begins to negotiate a raft of new free trade agreements, the optics of such a policy may in fact hinder international cooperation.”\nThe UK will host the next UN climate talks, originally set for November in Glasgow but delayed to next year by the coronavirus crisis. This gives ministers the opportunity to encourage other countries to bring forward strong plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to offer assistance to poor countries that could benefit by building their low-carbon export sectors, according to Stephen Cornelius, the chief climate adviser at WWF.\n“We should not be avoiding imports, but we should help other countries to reduce their carbon intensity,” he said. “The UK should work with other countries to bring forward high-ambition plans” under the Paris agreement.\nBarrett warned that ministers could be tempted, in drawing up plans for the economy to recover from the virus crisis, to pursue trade deals at any cost, without regard to their environmental impacts. “We have the option to improve standards, to encourage a low-carbon economy, or a race to the bottom,” he said. “That would undermine our environmental and social capital.”\nThe UK’s domestic emissions fall under the Climate Change Act, under which the government must meet carbon budgets set out by the independent Committee on Climate Change several years in advance.\nThe CCC has recommended that the UK continue to base its commitments on its “territorial” emissions, as this is the agreed international practice, but also keep track of emissions based on the consumption of goods from overseas and the implications of that trade.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The ice has retreated significantly in the years since, exposing a wealth of artefacts including knitted mittens, leather shoes and arrows still with their feathers attached.\nThough carbon dating of the finds reveals the pass was in use by farmers and travellers for a thousand years, from the Nordic iron age, around AD200-300, until it fell out of use after the Black Death in the 14th century, the bulk of the finds date from the period around AD1000, during the Viking era, when trade and mobility in the region were at their zenith.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDistaff made from birch, radiocarbon-dated to about AD800. Photograph: Espen Finstad/secretsoftheice.com\nDescribed as a “dream discovery” by glacial archaeologists, the finding was also a “poignant and evocative reminder of climate change”, said James Barrett, a medieval and environmental archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, who has been working with Norwegian archaeologists on the project since 2011.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nObject believed to be a locking device found in the Lendbreen pass area. Photograph: Espen Finstad/secretsoftheice.com\n“One is talking about artefacts that were put in the deep freeze 1,000 years ago, and later and earlier, and were taken out when we found them. So a textile is almost perfectly preserved, one might find arrows with the fletching perfectly preserved, with the sinew still in place, the glue that glued the feathers to the shaft. These are quite remarkable finds.”\nAdvertisement\nOf the hundreds of discoveries exposed by the retreating ice, some are structural, such as stone-built cairns that would have guided travellers through the fog, or the remains of a small shelter. Other finds are products that were being transported by local farmers to and from their summer pastures, such as dairy products and fodder, or by traders potentially carrying them much further afield, including reindeer pelts and antlers.\nAmong them are delicate wooden items such as a small, wood-turned bit for a lamb or goat and a carved distaff for spinning wool - even a Bronze Age ski. Last summer’s melt exposed an item that archaeologists have identified as a snowshoe for horses - “a quite remarkable object in its own right”, according to Barrett.\nWhile the objects are frequently “extraordinary”, he said, “what is really important archaeologically about them isn’t the individual objects, it’s the story that putting together all of the objects can tell you” about the pass and the people who travelled it.\nThanks to large-scale melting in 2019, most of the Lendbreen ice has retreated, meaning soon there will be nothing left to discover, said Barrett. “On the other hand, there are a lot of ice patches in the high elevations in [this part of Norway], so there will always be another - for the time being.”\nThe team’s discoveries are published in the journal Antiquity.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Yet traditions are being undermined as the young are tempted away by modernity, while their fragile ecosystem faces man-made destruction.\nBut now, the same technological developments so often deemed a threat to traditional ways of life, have offered the Achuar people, and other remote tribal people, the opportunity to preserve their legacy and fight back against the eradication of their histories.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLivia and her youngest daughter on their way to fish, Wayusentsa.

I feel that I give positive energy to the communities and families here.\n“The big trees are my grandparents. They speak to me. I feel very sad when I think about what will happen in a long time.

The summer of 2020 saw the third and widest outbreak of mass coral bleaching in five years.\nOcean heating, caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is threatening coral reefs around the globe.\nAdvertisement\nThe UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said most tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. Global heating is already at about 1C since the industrial revolution.\nThe federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said a “global response” was needed to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions.\nShe said: “For the average Australian and the average citizen of the world that cares deeply about the reef, this is our chance to shine and demonstrate that while we know climate change is the number one challenge to our reef, we also know there is much we can do to prepare the reef and put it in the best possible position for it to become as resilient as it needs to be.”\nThe feasibility study, led by AIMS, said: “Even if the world manages to stabilise global warming at 1.5C above the pre-industrial average, mass-bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Critically, the reef’s resilience may already be significantly impaired.”\nThe study added: “In short, we are facing the very real prospect that, within a generation and without concerted action to reduce emissions and help drive adaptation and faster recovery from damage, the Great Barrier Reef as we have known it will cease to exist.”\nLast week, the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dr David Wachenfeld, told Guardian Australia that measures to improve the reef’s resilience were needed, but their success was underpinned by “dealing with the climate problem.”\nSnow-white coral of once-vibrant Great Barrier Reef a sign urgent action must be taken\nAdam Morton\nRead more\nDr Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of AIMS, said the “best and brightest scientists” from across Australia had been brought together to work on the feasibility study.\n“What we have found is pretty profound. There is real hope for the reef,” he said.\n“RRAP is all about finding ways to help protect the reef from the effects of future warming and to prevent the kinds of bleaching that we have seen going on and to help damaged reefs recover.”\nHe said the research effort was “at the forefront of any science being done anywhere in the world”.\nSome methods previously discussed as having potential to lower temperatures on reefs during heat stress events – including using pumps and fans to circulate cooler deeper water onto shallower corals – have been ruled out for further research.\nBut other concepts have been approved for further research in programs that will run over the next five to 10 years. They include:\nShading reefs by brightening clouds using nano-sized ocean salt crystals, or creating fog and mist over smaller reef areas\nUsing “micro-bubbles”, ultra-thin natural films and farmed algae to reduce light over smaller areas\nStabilising and enhancing damaged reef structures with mesh, frames, concrete shapes and 3D printed forms that could recreate the complexity of natural reefs\nDispersing slicks of natural and tank-raised coral larvae onto reefs\nBreeding corals that are naturally more heat tolerant and then using their larvae in mass dispersal\nDavid Mead, the AIMS director of strategic development, who helped coordinate the feasibility study, told Guardian Australia: “The outcome we want is to retain the fundamental resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“This is to progress a broad range of ideas and some will get eliminated along the way.”\nOn cloud brightening, Mead explained the concept was to spray nano-sized droplets of salt water to increase the reflective capabilities of clouds.\nWhile the effect was “subtle” he said over a period of weeks initial modelling suggested it could keep water temperatures below the threshold where corals bleached.\n“It sounds scary and we need to do a lot of detailed studies on any downstream impacts,” he said.\nThe feasibility study also estimated the annual cost of the 43 different concepts being researched. While the costs seemed high – cloud brightening, for example, would cost an estimated $158m a year – Mead said the benefits were also very large.\nThe study modelled likely benefits from deploying the interventions, which ranged from $10.7bn over 60 years to figures in the hundreds of billions.\nBut the cost benefits from deploying the measures were dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and diminished as temperatures went higher.\nHardisty said the study had shown it was “technically feasible to act at scale” but he said “it’s going to be a combination of measures applied at different scales and in different areas that will work together to achieve real success.”\nHe said: “If we can get the science right and intervene on the reef at scale to prevent this kind of damage and build that resilience, then the benefits for Australia environmentally, socially and economically, especially for reef communities, is going to be in the tens of billions of dollars.”\nAnna Marsden, managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, said the feasibility study had shown that 71% of the Australian public supported large-scale efforts to help reefs adapt.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Figures have suggested that in July alone surface ice declined by 197 gigatonnes – equivalent to about 80 million Olympic swimming pools.\nNow experts have examined the level of melting in more detail, revealing what drove it. Crucially, the team note, the high pressure conditions lasted for 63 of the 92 summer days in 2019, compared with an average of just 28 days between 1981 and 2010. A similar situation was seen in 2012, a record bad year for melting of the ice sheet.\nThe team say the climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not taken into account such unusual conditions. If such high pressure zones become a regular annual feature, future melting could be twice as high as currently predicted, a result that could have serious consequences for sea level rise.\n“This melt event is a good alarm signal that we urgently need to change our way of living to hold [back] global warming because it is likely that the IPCC projections could be too optimistic for [the] Arctic,” said Dr Xavier Fettweis, co-author of the research from the University of Liege, adding that the atmospheric conditions were unlikely to be down to natural climatic variability and could be driven by global heating.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWriting in the journal the Cryosphere, Fettweis and his co-author Marco Tedesco from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University report how they used satellite data, climate models and global weather patterns to explore the melting of the surface of the ice sheet last year.\nAmong their findings the team report that almost 96% of the ice sheet underwent melting at some time in 2019, compared with an average of just over 64% between 1981 and 2010.\nUsing models, the pair also found that about 560Gt of meltwater runoff was generated in the summer of 2019. The surface mass balance, the amount of ice the sheet gained from rain and snowfall minus the amount lost through meltwater run off and evaporation, was just 54Gt a year– about 320Gt a year lower than the average across the earlier decades, and the greatest such drop on record.\nFurther analysis showed the level and distribution of melting to be closely tied to a number of factors, including levels of snowfall and reflection of sunlight – known as albedo – as well as cloudiness and absorption of sunlight. All of these, they note, were influenced by the persistent high pressure zone over the ice sheet last summer.\nDr Poul Christoffersen, a glaciologist at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, noting only 2012 had a higher meltwater runoff in recent years.\n“Clearly, this shows that extreme melt events are becoming a lot more frequent,” he said, adding that the new study showed that persistent atmospheric high pressure was an important factor, resulting in clear skies and a lack of snowfall in the south and warm, moist air being brought to northern parts of the ice sheet. “In that sense, the extreme melt years can be seen as natural events exacerbated by climate change,” said Christoffersen.\nProf Andy Shepherd from the University of Leeds said a fall in surface mass balance was concerning. “If that drops below zero, then the ice sheet is no longer viable because in every year it is losing more ice than it gains,” he said, adding that that was not even counting the loss of icebergs. “Even if the glaciers stopped flowing, which is not going to happen, it would mean that the ice sheet still can’t survive,” he said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown.\nHowever, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nTheir findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts. Many are under pressure to ignore or roll back previous commitments on the climate, and some stricken industries with high emissions – such as airlines and carmakers – have lobbied for a weakening of green measures. Oil producers have called a truce in their price war.\nBut reneging on green commitments now only stores up future problems, and will hasten climate breakdown, scientists have warned, and any respite from rising emissions caused by the crisis will be only temporary. All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before vital UN climate talks aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track.\nThe UN and the UK government have been forced to delay the talks, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called nationally determined contributions in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year’s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan’s plan showed no improvement.\nA UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: “We welcome Chile’s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see all countries following their lead.”\nCurrent climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Budgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations – it’s the fair and right thing to do. If we don’t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time.\n“And it’s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn’t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.”\nThe economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study’s authors. However, investments are needed to realise these gains, particularly from developed countries. The outlay would amount to between $5tn and $33tn for the US, and between $16tn and $105tn for the G20 countries as a whole.\nThe study said: “Early and quick action will provide a better chance to close the widening emissions gap, even though a large amount of abatement cost would occur in the short term.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

All the estuaries were acidifying.\nMore than half of remote reefs in Coral Sea marine park suffered extreme bleaching\nRead more\nThe study used data collected by field staff from the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment and covered five different types of estuaries – rivers, creeks, lakes and two kinds of lagoons.\nLagoons warmed 3.65C over the 12 years and rivers warmed 2.79C, the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found.\nThe warming in estuaries was occurring at a much faster rate than the average warming in the atmosphere or in the oceans – demonstrating that impacts of warming were not uniform and some habitats could see more rapid change.\nThe study said: “Our results highlight that air or ocean temperatures alone cannot be relied upon to estimate climate change in estuaries; rather, individual traits of any estuary need to be considered in the context of regional climate trends.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA NSW environment officer collects data at Wollumboola Lake near Nowra. Photograph: New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment\nThe study did not try to directly link the warming in estuaries to climate change but the authors noted that temperatures in estuaries had risen against a backdrop of Australia’s changing climate.\nAccording to Bureau of Meteorology data, NSW has not had a year where temperatures were below average since 1997. The two hottest years on record were 2019 followed by 2018.\nDr Elliot Scanes, a marine biologist at the University of Sydney and lead author of the study, told Guardian Australia that he was confident that global heating was partly to blame for the rising temperatures.\nHe said the data showed that “climate change has arrived in Australia; it is not a projection based on modelling, but empirical data from more than a decade of investigation”.\nHe said: “These sorts of affects have been anticipated, but maybe not at this rate. We have known that climate change will manifest in estuaries in some capacity.\n“This sort of rapid change could have negative effects for fisheries, but it’s going to be species specific.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDr Elliot Scanes believes global heating is partly to blame for the rising water temperatures. Photograph: University of Sydney\nAs well as rising air temperatures, a reduction in rainfall over the 12 years was also likely to have cut streamflow which meant the estuaries were shallower and more prone to heating.\nProf Pauline Ross, of the University of Sydney’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences and a co-author of the study, said estuaries provided “immense ecological and economic value”.\nAdvertisement\n“The rates of change observed in the study may also jeopardise the viability of coastal vegetation such as mangroves and saltmarsh in the coming decades and reduce their capacity to mitigate storm damage and sea level rise.”\nDr Ben Henley, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the study, said: “This is an interesting study and a very useful dataset but I would caution against extrapolating long-term trends or attributing climate change from a 6 to 12 year record. Ongoing monitoring will be important to confirm the trends in these observations.”\nScientists warn of 'critical gaps' in Australia's climate science capability\nRead more\nThe study also found that estuaries were acidifying with an average drop in pH of 0.5 between 2013 and 2019.\nThe causes for this drop, said Scanes, were harder to understand but could be down to higher CO2 in the atmosphere and the lower rainfall reducing the exchange of waters between the oceans and estuaries, causing minerals to build up.\nEstuaries in eastern Australia tended to be shallower, but shared characteristics with many other regions of the world that were also experiencing warming and drying climates, the study said.\nProf Perran Cook, of Monash University and an expert in estuaries and changes in coastal environments, said warming temperatures in estuaries would tend to lower oxygen levels in the water, increasing the risk of fish kills.\nBut he cautioned that the study covered a relatively short time period. Australia’s climate was already variable and he questioned whether that 2C warming trend over just 12 years would continue.\n“That’s saying that estuaries would be 6C warmer (in 20 years’ time) and I find that hard to believe,” he said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The current and urgent focus properly needs to be flattening the curve and saving lives.\nYet even as this overriding priority absorbs us, governments now need to be thinking about how to support the strongest possible recovery as we emerge from this crisis.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, underscores we are in both a health and economic crisis. In dealing with the former we cannot lose a generation to the latter.\nFocus on recovery must be on maximising economic growth and jobs, and ensuring this includes everyone. This was the guiding star that steered the international response to the global financial crisis.\nI was advising the prime minister Kevin Rudd at that time and saw first hand just how much foresight, coordination and effort was required for success. This is much worse, and so will demand so much more.\nReckoning with climate change will support a strongest possible recovery. The threat of climate change that is driving global action against it has not gone away. Indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic is a harbinger of climate disasters to come and the resilience we need to build into our systems – including health – to deal with what we know will be the adverse impacts of climate change.\nAustralia can be a better, fairer place after the coronavirus, if we're willing to fight for it\nLenore Taylor\nRead more\nWe know that unless we address this challenge, we will all be worse off; and the longer we take in addressing the challenge, the worse it will be. Just as Covid-19 requires us to act now to save lives in the next few weeks, climate change requires action now to avert a future global catastrophe. The logic of climate action has increasingly applied to global economic activity since the Paris agreement and must continue to underpin the investment decisions governments make going forward.\nDecisions that support the strongest possible recovery in growth will help to shape the future of the Australian economy. We must ensure these pathways to the future do not lock-in those that lead to damaging dead-ends: higher emissions and less climate resilience down the track to our economic, environmental and community disadvantage. Borrowing, as we are, from our kids to fund the billions in recovery stimulus, we cannot further burden them with such dead-ends.\nSignificantly, climate related investments in many cases will offer the best prospects for economic growth and jobs. On that basis alone they should be prioritised. The OECD report Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth demonstrated this in detail for the G20 in 2018.\nFor example, they provide options for major infrastructure investments which should be a bedrock of government stimulus for recovery: clean energy and new transport systems, more sustainable homes and buildings, improved agricultural practices water and waste management.\nIn short, if banks will not finance new coal-fired power in Australia but will lend for renewable energy and storage, which would you tend toward, and where then are the growth and jobs, and best place for stimulus?\nCorporates are increasingly working this out. There were a slew of announcements over summer largely subsumed by our preoccupation with drought, bushfires and pandemic. They show business banking on climate smart investment for growth.\nThe most significant example was BlackRock announcing a game-changing move to place sustainability at the centre of its investment approach because the returns to investors will be greater. BlackRock manages over US$7tn of assets, meaning other large asset managers will follow, as happened days after the announcement when State Street – managing US$3tn – went the same way.\nAs corporates are now integrating climate change as core business strategy, so should governments as core economic strategy, not least for recovery.\nWe know where such investments can be made. They are not hypothetical, whether outlined in CSIRO’s excellent technology roadmap for a low-emissions Australian economy, or Ross Garnaut’s recent excellent book on the growth opportunities Superpower: Australia’s Low Carbon Opportunity or last week’s inspiring report by Climate Works on de-carbonising Australia’s future, or presumably in the government’s forthcoming low-emissions technology roadmap for Australia.\nWe are not short on ideas, including on climate resilience.\nIt's not too early to start thinking about Australia after the crisis\nJim Chalmers\nRead more\nAn obvious starting point could be a nation-building stimulus investment around our decrepit energy system. By now the federal and state governments have a much stronger grasp of what we need for success, encouragingly evident on the recent $2bn federal-New South Wales government package for better access, security and affordability.\nTurbocharging this with a stimulus package for more renewable energy and flexible storage of all sorts (including hydrogen), accompanying transmission and security technologies for our electricity grid, and investment in dramatically improving energy efficiency would – literally and figuratively – power our economy forward.\nNot just for the growth and jobs in this sector alone but in the scope provided to power other sectors for growth, such as electrifying transport across the country – which stimulus could also spur.\nIn the aftermath of our drought and bushfires, another obvious area for nation-building investment is our land sector. Farm productivity can be dramatically improved by precision agriculture and regenerative farming technologies while building resilience to drought.\nNew sources of revenue for farmers can be created through soil carbon and forest carbon farming – with carbon trading from these activities internationally set to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade. These solutions and sources of growth and jobs can be harvested now with a little government support, keeping farmers on their land and regional communities thriving.\nIn these times of despair this prospect holds out great hope. Showing it is not a dream, the EU has already said its recovery stimulus will invest in climate for growth and jobs. We should too.\nPatrick Suckling was Australia’s ambassador for the environment, is a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute and senior partner at Pollination, a specialist climate investment and advisory firm\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Reports show that immigrant communities, black people and Americans with lower incomes are more vulnerable to the economic and health affects of Covid-19.\nIn general, Americans ranked infectious disease as more of a threat than terrorism, cyber attacks and climate change in the survey which took place from 3 to 29 March, while Covid-19 outbreaks prompted states and cities to lockdown.

In the short term, both in the UK and elsewhere, there is nothing more desirable than letting people resume their lives, once it is safe to do so.\nBut the speed of the “return to normal” is not the only thing that matters. The manner in which the world’s leaders manage the colossal economic and political shocks caused by the virus is also of the utmost importance. And at the top of their list of priorities, alongside human welfare, must be the biosphere and its future.\nIt’s too soon to say with any confidence what impact coronavirus will have on the climate emergency. The brakes placed on economic activities of many kinds, worldwide, have led to carbon emission cuts that would previously have been unthinkable: 18% in China between February and March; between 40% and 60% over recent weeks in Europe. Habits and behaviours once regarded as sacrosanct have been turned on their heads: road traffic in the UK has fallen by 70%. Global air traffic has halved. Meanwhile, a much-needed spotlight has been thrown on humans’ troubling relationship to wildlife, with some experts arguing that the degradation of the natural world and exploitation of other species is among the pandemic’s causes.\nIn human terms, the economic contraction precipitated by the virus – and predicted by the World Bank to lead to a severe depression – is sure to be brutal. No one, and least of all an elected government, would have chosen to limit emissions in this way. But if further savage waves of destruction to people’s livelihoods are to be avoided, rather than simply stored up or ignored until they become unignorable, just as coronavirus was, every possible effort must now be made to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, is as green as possible; that any and every stimulus package is directed towards renewable energy and zero- or low-carbon infrastructure and transport.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nThe urgency and desperation surrounding all such efforts are likely to militate against progressive measures. Already, governments are coming under huge pressure to bail out oil and gas companies (in the US and Canada this has already begun). But while in the short term the low oil price, which is also the result of a price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, could have the damaging effect of making oil more competitive against renewables, plunging demand and turmoil in the industry provide an opportunity that must be seized by all who oppose the continued dominance of fossil fuels.\nThere are other questions besides the future of oil that the crisis has opened up in unexpected ways. Huge political shifts are under way, with fiscally conservative governments such as Boris Johnson’s intervening in economies to an unprecedented extent. What was once impossible (socialist, reckless) now turns out not to be, at all. Could the renewed shock of human vulnerability in the face of Covid-19 make way for an increased willingness to face other perils, climate chaos among them?\nAdvertisement\nImpossible to say at this stage, perhaps. Certainly not without a fight against all those who will promote a return to business (and emissions) as usual. But with the postponement of crucial UN biodiversity and climate conferences, it has never been more important to keep up the pressure.

The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world’s biggest companies.\nAdvertisement\nAnalysis by InfluenceMap for the Guardian found that BlackRock in October controlled shares in fossil fuel companies worth $87.3bn that held 3.27bn barrels of fossil fuel reserves. BlackRock is a top-three investor in all eight of the world’s largest oil companies, and a top-10 investor in the 12 most systemically important banks in the world.\nKatrin Ganswindt, a climate and energy campaigner at Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said: “Appointing BlackRock as advisor to the European commission on environmental, social and governance factors seems a bit like letting the fox guard the henhouse. On top of being the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels, they are also among the leading global financiers of the weapons industry.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\n“We are baffled as to why the European commission didn’t think there would be a massive conflict of interest with this choice.”\nThe commission will pay BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) arm €280,000 (£244,000) for the study, according to a contract award notice published on the commission’s website – equating to only 1.3% of the $24m pay given to the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, in 2018, or 0.007% of the company’s $4.5bn operating profits in 2019.\nHowever, decisions made by European banking regulators on ESG issues could have significant financial effects on the companies whose shares BlackRock holds. For instance, looser restrictions on bank lending to companies fuelling the climate crisis could profit both oil companies and lenders.\nBlackRock itself has been strongly criticised for blocking progress on environmental issues. Guardian analysis of data from ProxyInsight found that BlackRock opposed or abstained on 82% of climate-related shareholder resolutions at the companies whose shares it managed between 2015 and 2019, far lower than many rivals.\nHowever, in 2020 the company has taken significant steps to make environmental sustainability a core part of its business. In January it said it would divest from companies that made 25% or more of their revenues from coal, as well as pledging to start using its voting power to force companies to disclose climate risks.\nA European commission spokesman said contract was awarded “in full and strict compliance with the applicable EU procurement rules, including those on the eligibility of tenderers and the prevention of any potential conflict of interest”.\nBlackRock’s tender was better than competitors, and it will form only one input in the EU’s policymaking, the spokesman added.\nA spokesman for BlackRock said its FMA arm functioned separately to the investment management unit.\nHe said: “We are honoured that BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory has been selected to perform an analysis to inform the European commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, deploying our expertise and capabilities in advising public-sector clients on structural trends, including the transition to a low-carbon future.”\n• This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the European commission’s suggested fee of €550,000.

Instead, emissions may fall by about 5%, or 2.5bn tonnes of CO2, to its lowest levels in about a decade.\nDr Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.\n“This decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,” he said.\n“The reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.”\nThe fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and the abrupt halt of flights and driving could cause the world’s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008.\nThe analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad.\nThe analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively.\nErik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: “The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world’s total carbon emissions.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“The last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day.

Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year.\nFewer cars on the road will also dent demand for petrol and diesel by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day.\nShare your story\nShare your stories\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

Today, a paper in the journal Science says these “long-lived pioneers” contribute more than previously believed to carbon sequestration and biomass increase.\nThe authors said their study highlights the importance of forest protection and biodiversity as a strategy to ease global heating. They say it should also encourage global climate modellers to shift away from representing all the trees in a forest as essentially the same.\n“This analysis shows that that is not good enough for tropical forests and provides a way forward,” said Caroline Farrior, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin. “We show that the variation in tropical forest species’ growth, survival and reproduction is important for predicting forest carbon storage.”\nHead in the clouds: the woman scaling fresh climate change heights\nRead more\nLong-lived pioneers – a term that has been around for decades – include species such as mahogany, Brazil nut trees and Ceiba pentandra, which are visible far above the rest of the canopy because they grow fast (at up to twice the speed of plants lower in the canopy) for hundreds of years.\nResearchers believe this is the result of a trade-off between stature and reproduction: they are able to put more energy into putting on biomass than into producing offspring.\nThe study is based on more than 30 years of data collected from old growth and secondary rainforest on Barro Colorado, an island in the middle of the Panama Canal.\nThe scientists grouped the 282 different species of tree into five categories determined by growth, reproduction and longevity. This showed the relative roles of “fast” species that grow and die quickly, “slow” species that grow slowly and reach an old age, “infertile giants” that live long and reproduce over a long time, and “fertile dwarfs” and small shrubs and low treelets that grow slowly, die young, but produce a large number of offspring.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe trunk and part of the canopy of the Brazil nut tree, one of the most dominant tree species in the Amazon. Photograph: Hans ter Steege/PA\nAdvertisement\nBy simulating different combinations of these groups, the scientists were able to build a model that reproduced the dynamics of the recovery of nearby young forests.\nThis knowledge of how quickly trees grow, how long they live and how many offspring they produce could help in the restoration of tropical forests, which are currently being cut down at an alarming rate. It could also dispel a theory that such giant trees disappear once a forest reaches maturity.\n“Our results show long-lived pioneers are not transient but an important feature in old forests. They represent about 40% of the biomass and there are no signs that this declines over time,” said the paper’s lead author, Nadja Rüger of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research and the University of Leipzig. However, she cautioned that others forest showed different patterns.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It’s quite devastating.”\nEven at 10 metres deep, some reefs saw half their corals bleached, with isolated bleaching seen as deep as 20 metres.\nHoey, a marine biologist at James Cook University, said the results were preliminary with further analysis to be carried out for the three-year monitoring project, which comes to a close in June.\nThe project is the most extensive reef survey of the Coral Sea Marine Park ever undertaken and is funded by the federal government agency Parks Australia.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBleaching at Holmes Reef. Photograph: Dani Ceccarelli\nHoey said in 2020 they had visited “the majority of the reef complexes” across the marine park that covers almost 1m sq km. A small number of reefs in the far north and far east were not visited this year.\nMore than half of the reefs visited had been severely bleached, including dive tourism spots like Osprey Reef north of Port Douglas, Bougainville Reef off Cooktown and Flinders Reef off Townsville.\nThe Coral Sea reefs are less well known than their neighbours to the west on the Great Barrier Reef, which experienced a third mass bleaching outbreak in five years this summer.\nGreat Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet\nRead more\nThe Coral Sea reefs were surveyed between mid-February and mid-March. Hoey said water temperatures were above 30C. Usual temperatures were 27C and 28C.\nCorals bleach when they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Corals can recover if bleaching is only mild but if temperatures are very high for prolonged periods, corals can die.\nOn 18 March, the US government’s Coral Reef Watch program produced analysis of heat stress over the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea showing “significant amounts of heat stress”.\nTownsville-based Dr William Skirving, of Coral Reef Watch, told Guardian Australia: “All the Australia reefs outside of the GBR will have had significant amounts of bleaching and many would have had significant amounts of mortality.”\nAdvertisement\nHoey said unlike reefs closer to shore in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the reefs in the Coral Sea were largely unaffected by pollution and fishing pressures.\n“But they are extremely susceptible to climate-induced stresses,” he said.\nHoey said it was “hard to predict” how many corals would die.\nThese more remote reefs, he said, relied on their own corals to spawn and regrow, unlike the more tightly packed reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.\nHe said: “Any coral mortality will take a lot longer to recover from because there is hundreds of kilometres between these reefs and so there’s unlikely to be a lot of connectivity between them.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“Because of their isolation we have a lot to learn about these reefs, but we would still expect any fish and other organisms relying on the reefs to have been affected, particularly those relying on the corals for food and shelter.”\nRichard Leck, WWF-Australia’s head of oceans, said it was concerning that Coral Sea reefs had bleached because they were regarded as more resilient, as they benefitted from cool water upwelling and very clear water.\nHe said: “The fact they have bleached shows how extreme the underwater heatwave was in the Coral Sea. It shows how close we are to a tipping point with climate change and coral reefs.\n“The reefs in the Coral Sea are less well known, except amongst the high-end scuba diving community. They’re a jewel in the crown for many divers around the world to come and visit.”\nCraig Stephen, managing director of Mike Ball Dive Expeditions, has been visiting the Coral Sea reefs since 1995.\nHe said there were still many amazing places to visit on the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea and “given time” he said he thought the reefs would recover.\n“These [Coral Sea] reefs rise from the sheer depths in very clear water,” he said. “Large soft corals and sea fans dominate the depths and sharks abound, giving the diver a real sense of being in the abyss.\n“You can hang off a wall that’s 1,000 metres and there you feel pretty insignificant. People enjoy the vastness of it.”\nThe 2020 bleaching was a “reset point for many of us” he said, adding: “We do need to step back and have a look at what we are doing to the planet.\nAdvertisement\n“If we don’t take a good look at ourselves and do something about our CO2 emissions then things will get out of our control.

Commit to repealing the 1996 immigration reform laws and creating citizenship pathways for all undocumented people without harmful provisions. Amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that all people, including undocumented immigrants, must be included in any healthcare reform as viruses do not discriminate on the basis of immigration status.\nHealthcare: Support the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act to allow the government to manufacture generic versions of drugs and dramatically lower prescription drug prices. Support Medicare for All, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

At a circular fence of waist-high thorny bushes, she knocks on the metal sheet serving as a makeshift door. A woman’s face, partially hidden by a bright green hijab, appears. “Salaam Alaikum,” Abdulle says, “peace be upon you.”\nHolding up a hand to the armed guards tasked with accompanying the visiting charity staff following her around the displacement camp, she instructs them to stay outside.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“We don’t want to scare her,” she says.\nAbdulle, 48, was living in the desert town of Oog in northern Somalia in 2016 when drought turned the region to dust, driving thousands of families from their homes. Now she makes daily visits to one of three sprawling displacement camps outside the town to campaign for vulnerable women and girls. Once a climate refugee herself, she knows what their lives are like.\n“I tell them to gather in groups when they go out,” Abdulle says. “That most of the men are your enemies, so don’t go out alone so you can be safe from the violence and the rape, especially at night-time.”\nIn Somalia, climate change is driving rape, sexual violence and intimate partner violence. Droughts linked to climate change ravage the landscape with increasing frequency, hurting families who depend on farming and herding animals.\nThe spike in regional violence against women and girls takes two forms: domestic violence against women who have become family breadwinners , and sexual violence against women and girls who have migrated to camps near crowded urban centres.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHalima, 20, lived with her elderly husband in rural Somaliland. When he died she was left destitute and travelled to Oog, in Sool region, for help Photograph: Will Swanson\nAbdulle came from a pastoralist family, displaced by drought and conflict during Somalia’s civil war in the 80s. After a nomadic life with her family, Abdulle was sent to the capital city, Mogadishu, for her education. She returned first to her parents in northern Somalia, and then moved to Oog.\nAdvertisement\n“When my family [lived] in the countryside, we had a drought like this one [in 2016],” Abdulle says. “The people were helped. Some were educated, some worked and some of them went abroad. I know something about the droughts. When the droughts come, there can be good change for the people, especially for women.”\nIn 2016, when waves of displaced pastoralist families streamed into Oog, looking for healthcare, food, water and shelter, Abdulle felt compelled to document the crisis and to protect and empower women and girls. She recorded videos to send to the government and the Somali diaspora, requesting support for the overwhelming need.\nAbdulle’s no-nonsense attitude and unrelenting commitment encouraged the community to approach the local government to request she be put in charge of their welfare. Holding a paid leadership position overseeing men is an usual responsibility for a woman in Somalia’s male-dominated society.\n“The surprising thing is that the three male heads of the three IDP camps are … happy that Ibado is above them,” said Muna Hussein, a gender officer at Oxfam, who works closely with Abdulle. “They listen to her.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHuda, 35, stands in her home at a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Oog, in Somaliland Photograph: Will Swanson\nCamp conditions are hazardous for women: there is no lighting at night, and no doors or fences to keep out opportunistic criminals and predators. As drought continued in 2017 and 2018, the population in Oog’s camps boomed. And crimes against women and girls mounted.\nWhile updated statistics are hard to come by, at least 25% of Somali women have experienced gender-based violence exacerbated by conflict and displacement due to the climate emergency, World Bank data shows. Much of this violence happens in displaced communities.\nResearch from Oxfam suggests women in Somalia are most at risk when walking to collect water and firewood, using outdoor toilets and sleeping in makeshift huts that lack doors and lighting. The perpetrators come from both inside and outside the camps. The government, fragile and under-resourced, cannot provide protection and services to the nearly 2.6 million Somalis already displaced.\nAbdulle has sought to help local women and girls protect themselves by organising groups to collect water and firewood. She has also coordinated forums, groups of volunteers who meet to learn how to campaign for their needs and rights. She also acts as a counsellor and friend for women who have been attacked.\n“If a girl who was raped came to me, I would start by speaking with her,” Abdulle says. “Then, I would take her to the hospital for any treatment. And I would take her to the nearest police station immediately to arrest the perpetrator of this crime.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSukhra Idris, says she was abused by her husband because she tried to find work, take her children and leave him when he refused to provide for the family.

According to experts, men unable to provide for their families often become more prone to domestic violence.

Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.\nOcean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen.\nBy the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest.\n“It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature.\n'Tipping points' could exacerbate climate crisis, scientists fear\nRead more\nWhat appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse.\nThe authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005.\nThen they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.\nThe sound of an iceberg melting\nThe sound of an iceberg melting\n00:00:00\n00:00:34\n“Despite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn’t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one – or a few – snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,” Pigot explained.\n“In our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.”\nThe scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an “abrupt exposure event”, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage.\nBut at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures.\nThat means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by “flattening the curve” of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt.\n“It is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,” said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study.\nOceans losing oxygen at unprecedented rate, experts warn\nRead more\n“Our research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.”\nScientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting.\nThis new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating.\nAdvertisement\nMark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss.\n“The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there,” he said in an interview published in the Catholic weekly the Tablet.\nHe added: “I’m thinking at this time of the saints who live next door. They are heroes – doctors, volunteers, religious sisters, priests, shop workers – all performing their duty so that society can continue functioning. How many doctors and nurses have died! How many religious sisters have died! All serving … If we become aware of this miracle of the next-door saints, if we can follow their tracks, the miracle will end well, for the good of all.”\nResponding to questions put to him by Austen Ivereigh, the British author of a papal biography, Francis spoke of the hypocrisy of politicians who talk about facing up to the coronavirus crisis sweeping the globe while failing to tackle the environmental emergency, supporting a “throwaway culture”, and continuing to manufacture weapons.\nPlay Video\n5:52\nCoronavirus: how to cope with anxiety and self-isolation – video explainer\n“It’s true, a number of governments have taken exemplary measures to defend the population on the basis of clear priorities. But we’re realising that all our thinking, like it or not, has been shaped around the economy.\n“In the world of finance it has seemed normal to sacrifice [people], to practise a politics of the throwaway culture, from the beginning to the end of life … It’s a culture of euthanasia, either legal or covert, in which the elderly are given medication but only up to a point.”\nThe coronavirus crisis put a spotlight on people’s values. “I am worried by the hypocrisy of certain political personalities who speak of facing up to the crisis, of the problem of hunger in the world, but who in the meantime manufacture weapons. This is a time to be converted from this kind of functional hypocrisy. It’s a time for integrity. Either we are coherent with our beliefs or we lose everything.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe climate crisis had been forgotten in the focus on the pandemic, he said. “Who now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of the floods? I don’t know if these are the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature’s responses.”\nHe added: “Today I believe we have to slow down our rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand and contemplate the natural world. We need to reconnect with our real surroundings …\n“Let us not lose our memory once all this is past, let us not file it away and go back to where we were. This is the time to take the decisive step, to move from using and misusing nature to contemplating it. We have lost the contemplative dimension; we have to get it back at this time.”\nAdvertisement\nThis was the moment to focus on the poor, the homeless and those on the margins. “But the poor are hidden, because poverty is bashful. In Rome recently, in the midst of the quarantine, a policeman said to a man: ‘You can’t be on the street, go home.’ The response was: “I have no home. I live in the street.’ To discover such a large number of people who are on the margins … They are there but we don’t see them: they have become part of the landscape; they are things.”\nIn Europe, he said, “when we are beginning to hear populist speeches and witness political decisions of [a] selective kind, it’s all too easy to remember Hitler’s speeches in 1933, which were not so different from some of the speeches of a few European politicians now”.\nPope Francis described life under lockdown in the Santa Marta residence, where he lives. “We now have two shifts for meals, which helps a lot to alleviate the impact. Everyone works in his office or from his room, using technology. Everyone is working; there are no idlers here.\n“How am I living this spiritually? I’m praying more, because I feel I should. And I think of people. That’s what concerns me: people. Thinking of people anoints me, it does me good, it takes me out of my self-preoccupation. Of course I have my areas of selfishness.

The grounding of aircraft during the pandemic means the baseline will be far lower than envisaged, and the carbon targets much more challenging, if Corsia goes ahead without changes.\nIata has told ICAO that the baseline “must be adjusted to ensure the sustainable development of international aviation and avoid an inappropriate economic burden on the sector”. It said some nations could pull out of the agreement if the costs were too high.\nBefore the Covid-19 crisis, estimates showed that airlines were likely to have to spend between £4bn and £18bn a year globally on carbon credits by 2035 to satisfy the Corsia rules. A report by the Green Alliance, before the coronavirus lockdown, found that this was not enough to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement.\nThe ICAO council had signed off on the Corsia plans on 13 March, gaining plaudits from green campaigners for sticking with its pledges on the climate crisis instead of shelving them in the face of the pandemic. However, airlines’ commitment now looks distinctly shaky.\nThe US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a long-time mover behind the Corsia scheme, argued that the existing Corsia rules allowed enough flexibility for governments to address the “suppressed activity in 2020, without any need to renegotiate the measure in a drawn-out political discussion”.\nJames Elliott, a Green Alliance policy adviser, said: “Calls to reduce burdens on the [aviation] sector as it recovers are understandable. But the climate emergency also presents an urgent challenge which must be addressed. If the sector cannot find ways to rebuild itself sustainably after the Covid-19 crisis, it will face painful disruption again in the future as its part in the climate emergency has to be addressed.\n“If Corsia is amended, it must be done in a way which also strengthens its ambition, with targets to limit and reduce actual emissions levels.”\nGreenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “At the same time as they’re asking for huge government bailouts, airlines are also lobbying furiously to dodge their obligations towards cutting carbon emissions.\n“Offsetting schemes have always been big polluters’ favourite excuse to carry on polluting while shifting responsibility for their emissions to someone else. The industry’s current proposal would only make the buck-passing easier.”\nShare your story\nShare your stories\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

That it hasn’t been reported in most of Australia’s major news outlets doesn’t make that any less the case.\nAcross nine days last month, Prof Terry Hughes from James Cook University travelled the length of the Great Barrier Reef in a small plane to survey the health of more than 1,000 individual sites. He was joined by an observer from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a government agency.\nHughes has been here before. It was his work in 2016 and 2017 that told us there had been back-to-back mass bleaching events that ultimately killed an estimated 49% of shallow water corals.\nGreat Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet\nRead more\nHis technique sounds uncomplicated, but it relies on sharp observational skills honed over decades. Reefs are filmed, assessed and scored. If 60% of coral on a reef has been drained of its colour it is considered severely bleached. Where possible, the assessments are checked and confirmed in the water.\nHughes this week released maps that show 25% of reefs falling into this category, with another 35% having recorded modest bleaching. The marine park authority has confirmed it is the third mass bleaching event to hit the global landmark in just five years. It is the most widespread and second most severe episode of its type on record.\nCrucially, areas that previously escaped bleaching at the southern end, particularly those near or below Mackay, have been badly hit. The affected reefs include those around the Keppel group of islands, where Pauline Hanson was filmed diving in 2016 as she denied bleaching was a significant problem. Hughes says the coral there is now “snow white”.\nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?\nRead more\nThe impact of bleaching is now cumulative. Across the three events, in 2016 , 2017 and 2020, reefs along nearly the full length of the 2,300km natural wonder have been severely affected. Some of the staghorn corals in the south this year are expected to die in the months ahead, and turn a scuzzy brown as they are swamped by algae. Others will survive but be less resilient and aren’t likely to make it next time bleaching hits.\nUnprecedented is a word that gets thrown around so often now that it has lost meaning but it is a clear understatement when describing what has happened here.\nLook at it this way: when the Australian government last reported to the Unesco world heritage centre on the health of the reef back in 2015 – a moment that led to an extended diplomatic dance by the Coalition government to avoid it being labelled world heritage “in danger” – there had been only two mass bleaching events in observed history, and none since 2002.\nAdvertisement\nSince then, the reef has bleached more years than not. The two most recent events have been in both years when there was no El Niño, the climate cycle in the Pacific that inflates water temperatures.\nIt suggests the underlying global heating is now at a level that an extended spell of warm weather is enough to leave the reef stricken. Next summer is considered a reasonable chance to bring another El Niño on top of that.\nHughes took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his heartbreak at again seeing the natural monument he has dedicated his life to studying irrevocably hurt, and raise doubts whether he would make the trip again.\nBut the most striking commentary on the reef came from David Wachenfeld, the marine park authority’s chief scientist. It is rare for public officials to speak their minds in ways that may be uncomfortable for their elected overlords but, in an interview with my colleague Graham Readfearn, Wachenfeld set out the reef’s plight in clear, blunt language.\nHe described the bleaching as a clear signal the reef was calling for urgent help, warned the resilience of the reef was not limitless and said it would require the “strongest action possible” on climate change to save it given the planet is headed for 3C heating – a level at which science tells us coral reefs can’t be protected.\nThat science was summarised by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reported a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear if heating was limited to 1.5C, and would be “at very high risk” at just 1.2C. The globe has already warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution.\nThe government’s language did not match Wachenfeld’s urgency. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, acknowledged mass bleaching was “deeply concerning” and the importance of coordinated global action to cut emissions but said the focus had to be on programs to reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience.\nIt echoed Scott Morrison’s eventual response to the summer bushfires: conceding the role played by rising emissions but quickly emphasising adaptation over Australia doing more to tackle the problem at its source.\nThere is another potential path, of course. Written down, it couldn’t sound simpler. It is true that Australia cannot address the climate crisis on its own but it is the world’s 14th biggest emitter and, as Morrison pointed out after he joined a G20 video conference to discuss coronavirus, can be influential in global debates.\nAustralia’s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps\nRead more\nA growing number of analysts and policy experts, including ClimateWorks Australia and Ross Garnaut, have suggested in detail that the country could set a jobs-friendly and economically sound course to net-zero emissions. The stimulus program that will be needed to recover from the pandemic offers a one-shot opportunity to speed up a clean transition.\nAdvertisement\nThis combination of action at home combined with a new diplomatic effort would give Australia the best chance at saving the reef. At a minimum, Australia’s new role as a climate hawk would point to a future in which the country embraced what will be an inevitable shift to a low-emissions world, rather than be dragged to it. And the prime minister, in his new collaborative mode, could have influenced others on the way.\nUnlikely, perhaps. Some would say impossible.

Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.\nThe new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time.\nIndeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions – which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years – is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLava piles of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province in Morocco (Midelt) Photograph: Andrea Marzoli\nThat, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. “[This] suggests that the end-Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future,” the team write.\nAdvertisement\nCapriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. “The end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,” he said.\nWriting in the journal Nature Communications, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province – a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe team found around 10% of the samples showed the presences of bubbles within small blobs of magma trapped by crystals in the rocks, most of which were found to contain carbon dioxide. Further analysis, they say, suggests the gas probably became entrapped deep within the Earth’s crust, suggesting it originated in the lower-middle crust or in the mantle.\nFrom these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down.\nDr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. “Over the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,” she said.\nThe new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. “The study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from individual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,” she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects.\nThat, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. “The initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,” she said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Their proposals and photography work impressed the jury and embraced the Climate Visuals seven principles for impactful photography.\nDrowning Land by Aji Styawan\nIndonesia is one of the largest archipelago nations in the world, with more than 17,000 islands. The majority of the small islands are only a metre above sea level. Deforestation, land reclamation and groundwater extraction make these areas even more vulnerable to rising sea levels.\nExperts predict that before 2050, thousands of small islands and millions of houses in coastal areas across Indonesia will disappear due to rising sea levels.\nDemak is on the northern coast of Central Java, about 300 miles east of Jakarta. More than 500 households have been displaced in the past 20 years.\nAs the sea levels rose, farmland became fish ponds and mangrove forests, which are now also submerged. Today it’s all sea.\n3 Millimeters by Greg Kahn\nThree extra millimetres of water every year will make land vanish. It will swallow communities. It will change environmental habitats forever. It will cause record pollution. For townspeople along the inner coastal region of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, the impact of sea level rise is no longer an abstract worry debated by politicians. They see the land becoming more saturated beneath their feet. Thirteen of the bay’s southern islands, many of them once inhabited, are gone.\n3 Millimeters explores the waterways of Maryland, where, due to the region’s makeup and Atlantic Ocean flow, sea levels are rising twice as fast as the global average and will leap by as much as 5ft by 2100. This will submerge more than 250,000 acres of land, displacing more than half a million people. Farms once fertile and productive now wilt as mounting salinity levels force families to abandon their way of life.\nThere is nothing to stop Hoopers Island from slowly drowning. Locals point 100 yards into the bay, telling stories of a baseball field where they used to play. Graves containing the island founders, once buffered by a forest, now jut out from an eroding shoreline patched with makeshift rock walls. “I doubt there’ll be any human life here in 100 years,” said Donald Webster, who works for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\nWhile nothing can reverse rising seas in places like Smith Island, there is hope for others. Gradient sea walls, vegetation renourishment and public education are all trying to preserve natural habitat and homes along the coast. The hope is that it will stop erosion as well as maintain habitat for sealife such as horseshoe crabs and terrapins."},{"title":"Great Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet","paragraph":"The government’s top Great Barrier Reef scientist says a third mass bleaching event in five years is a clear signal the marine wonder is “calling for urgent help” on climate change.\nOne quarter of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer in the most widespread outbreak ever witnessed, according to analysis of aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs released on Tuesday.\nDr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: “My greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there’s no action.\n“People need to see these [bleaching] events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.”\nProf Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights.\nHughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef – northern, central and southern – the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA coral bleaching map showing the worst affected areas in 2020 highlighted in red.

Photograph: ARC Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies\nSome 25% of the reefs were severely bleached – meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached.\nHughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to “high levels of mortality” of corals.\nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?\nRead more\nThe Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating.\nHughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species.\nAustralian Academy of Science\n(@Science_Academy)\nThe #GreatBarrierReef has experienced the third mass coral bleaching event in five years, explains @ProfTerryHughes@jcu @CoralCoE @MorganPratchett pic.twitter.com/nAQOQWcgq5\nApril 6, 2020\nThe 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said.\nCorals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals.\nHughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef – from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that “light up like a Christmas tree” when viewed from the air.\n“It’s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,” he said. “But business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.”\nIn February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900.\nSome scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually.\nWachenfeld said the reef’s sheer size – it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs – made it resilient, “but climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before”.\nHe told Guardian Australia: “Three mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate.\n'Probably the worst year in a century': Australia's environmental toll of 2019\nRead more\n“No one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.”\nThe globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.\nWachenfeld said: “We’re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.”\nMeasures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals.\n“None of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,” Wachenfeld said. “Dealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.”\nAdvertisement\nUnder the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C.\n“That’s the window we have to aim for,” Wachenfeld said.\n“As we approach and go beyond 2C, I don’t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef.\n“The world is heading for 3C of warming – we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances.\nGreat Barrier Reef world heritage values damaged by climate change, government admits\nRead more\n“The reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.”\nIn a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience.\n“The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures.\n“Thankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.”\nQueensland’s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats “are testing the reef’s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.”\nShe said the Palaszczuk government had “committed to a zero net emissions target by 2050” and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022.\n“The missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,” she said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Although Volkswagen has been found guilty in the US, in Europe the carmaker has denied that it cheated tests.\nThe preliminary finding in the case on Monday, by Mr Justice Waksman, casts a fresh light on the activities of the carmaker, first revealed in the “dieselgate” scandal of 2015.\nIn his summary, the judge wrote: “[After considering the arguments made by Volkswagen] the upshot was that I found that the software function in the vehicles here did indeed amount to a prohibited ‘defeat device’… I also concluded that VW’s attempt to relitigate the issue here was an abuse of the process.”\nHe said: “A software function which enables a vehicle to pass the test because (artificially) it operates the vehicle in a way which is bound to pass the test and in which it does not operate on the road is a fundamental subversion of the test … it destroys the utility of the test.”\nVolkswagen in 'Dieselgate' settlement talks with 400,000 German owners\nRead more\nDiesel vehicles were once touted by the car industry as a green alternative to petrol vehicles because they have lower greenhouse gas emissions. But their emissions of tiny particles and irritant gases such as nitrogen dioxide are far higher, unless trapped by filters.\nIn 2015, campaigners revealed that cars produced by Volkswagen emitted far more nitrogen oxides in standard road driving than was recorded in test conditions. The ensuing scandal engulfed the car industry, which has faced turmoil and falling sales in some categories.\nThe revelations also highlighted rampant air pollution around the world, which is estimated to cause as many as 800,000 premature deaths every year in Europe alone.\nAdvertisement\nIn the UK, the sale of new diesel and petrol cars is to be banned from 2035, in an effort to clear up dangerous air and reduce the impact of road transport on the climate crisis.\nJenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Diesel exhaust is in the same category for causing cancer as smoking, according to the World Health Organization, so to deliberately hide this toxicity cannot go unnoticed or indeed unpunished. The sale of all diesel and petrol cars and vans should be banned by 2030, earlier than the government is planning, both for air pollution and climate reasons.”\nVolkswagen is now likely to continue to a full trial of liability for the claims of deceit. The claimants argue that they were sold vehicles that were represented as being compliant with emissions regulations, when they did not comply.\nA spokesperson for Volkswagen Group told the Guardian: “The judgment relates only to preliminary issues [and] does not determine liability or any issues of causation or loss for any of the causes of action claimed. These remain to be determined by the court as the case continues.\n“Volkswagen remains confident in our case that we are not liable to the claimants as alleged and the claimants did not suffer any loss. We will continue to defend our position robustly. Nothing in this decision today changes this.”\n33m polluting cars still on EU roads after Dieselgate scandal\nRead more\nThe group litigation order in the UK is brought against Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat, the Volkswagen financial services arm, and various authorised dealers, by owners and lessees of cars under these brands which used a particular Volkswagen diesel engine.\nIn the US, Volkswagen has paid out $4.3bn (£3.5bn) in civil and criminal penalties since pleading guilty more than two years ago to criminal charges based on deceit. Global costs are thought to have reached at least $21bn.\nGareth Pope, who leads the legal team at the Slater and Gordon law firm, representing 70,000 claimants, said: “This damning judgment confirms what our clients have known for a long time but Volkswagen has refused to accept: that Volkswagen fitted defeat devices into millions of vehicles in the UK in order to cheat emissions tests.\n“The court’s conclusion that the existence of software was a ‘fundamental subversion’ of tests designed to limit pollution and make our air safe to breath exposes VW’s disregard for EU emissions regulations and public health, in pursuit of profit and market dominance.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

I’m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it’s hard.\nThe background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be “game over” for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the financing and permits, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It’s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then came the coronavirus epidemic – and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.\nIn Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a “war room” to fight environmentalists, invested $1.1bn of taxpayers’ money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a loan guarantee.\nMeanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest “critical infrastructure” like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, made it a felony even to “incite” such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a memorandum exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was “critical” – that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to cut supply.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nOn Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was moving workers from across America into place in states along the pipeline route – although local reporters in Montana discovered they’d actually begun arriving 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.\nOn Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a $1.25bn bond issue for TC Energy.\nSo here’s how it shakes out:\n1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are “essential” employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet’s climate system.\n2) The work is being done on the edges of many Indian reservations – endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have endured 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux put it on Wednesday, “this causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally”.\n3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can’t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet – but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.\nThere are plenty of targets for anger – timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:\n“Vice-president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project – including all pipelines – there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines – including to national security and diplomacy – is a model to build from in establishing this process.”\nBut let’s be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let’s further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they’ve prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come. And the banks are their invaluable allies: Chase Bank has lent $268bn to the industry since the Paris climate accords – what’s another billion to build a useless pipeline and perhaps spread a fatal disease?\nLiterally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No – let’s be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time. These aren’t penny-ante price gougers trying to corner the local market in hand sanitizer so they can make a buck – these are cold-blooded and calculating members of the one percent. It’s so over-the-top evil that it’s like the comic book version of Naomi Klein’s Shock Doctrine, written in blood.\nI am a Methodist, sometimes a Sunday School teacher. I don’t actually believe in hell – I think God is capable of forgiving people for the worst things. But I don’t think I am.\nThough the hour is late, there may still be ways to fight this blitzkrieg. The coalitions that have battled it for a decade are, even forced apart by the microbe, now coming together to try. We will do it with real and unabating rage in our hearts.\nHow could anyone be this low?\nBill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

Back-to-back mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017, and cyclones in 2014 and 2015, had wreaked havoc.\nBut in January, she saw thousands of new colonies of fast-growing Acropora corals that had “claimed the space” left by dead and degraded corals. In a three-year window without spiralling heat or churning cyclones, some corals were in an adolescent bloom – not mature enough to spawn, but getting close.\nClimate crisis may have pushed world's tropical coral reefs to tipping point of 'near-annual' bleaching\nRead more\n“It was an incredible recovery,” says Richards, of Curtin University. “But I knew if it was hit again, it would be trouble – and that’s exactly what happened.”\nIn 2020, mass bleaching returned to Lizard Island – perhaps not as badly as in previous years – but enough, says Richards, to turn the clock back on the recovery she had seen.\nZoe Richards\n(@ZoeR_Coral)\nDay 1 of coral biodiversity re-surveys @ Lizard I, GBR.

The back-to-back bleaching of 2016 and 2017 was mostly confined to the northern and central sections.\nAdvertisement\nData from aerial surveys is still being analysed, but the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has said preliminary results suggest the 2020 bleaching had a much broader footprint.\nWhen bleaching is mild, corals can and do recover, although it can make them more susceptible to disease. But severe bleaching can kill corals. Estimates are that the 2016 bleaching killed about 29% of the reef’s shallow water corals and the 2017 event took another 19%.\nSome scientists are now concerned global heating may have reached a point where tropical reefs bleach almost every year.\nWhat this means for the reef in the coming decades is an area of live research and debate among scientists.\nCan we fix it?\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nScientists Guardian Australia spoke to say the reef’s fortunes hang on the answers to two questions.\nThe first is whether governments around the world will make deeper cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have already agreed and, if so, how close they will get to keeping global heating to 1.5C.\nA second is whether efforts to first identify and then deploy a swathe of potential measures that could reduce the impact of rising temperatures will be successful.\nWhat seems clear is that without some human intervention, the magic of the world’s greatest coral reef system will be lost.\nAdvertisement\nProf Peter Mumby, professor of coral reef ecology at the University of Queensland, is the chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Foundation – the once-small not-for-profit that was awarded a controversial $443m government grant in 2018.\nI’m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates\nOve Hoegh-Guldberg\nHe said the 2020 bleaching “is giving us greater pause, given it seems we can see quite frequent coral bleaching events earlier than people had previously expected”.\nMumby says bleaching events have been “patchy”, and the fact that some areas have escaped “means there’s an opportunity for management”.\nWhat keeps the reef functioning as a single ecosystem is the way each reef connects to another through the way corals reproduce. They all either spawn, or produce larvae, that can float in the water column and settle on nearby reefs.\nMumby and colleagues have identified about 100 reefs along the GBR that are well spread, well connected to other reefs by ocean currents, and tend to experience cooler temperatures.\nHe says making sure those reefs stay as healthy as possible – in particular by managing outbreaks of the coral-eating crown of thorns starfish – could be crucial in keeping the wider reef viable.\nThe reef’s unrivalled size and diversity – almost 4,000 reefs, cays and islands stretching for more than 2,000 kilometres – gives it extra resilience, he says.\nClimate change is still the reef’s biggest threat and society will need to focus on tackling it, “but there needs to be a way to adapt to how we manage reefs so that they can roll with the punches – we have to do both those things”.\nThe Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS) has produced an as-yet unpublished study, sent to the federal government, that reviews more than 160 different interventions that have been suggested for the reef, identifying about 40 that could be worth further study.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHeat-stressed corals off Lizard Island in February 2020. Photograph: Dr Lyle Vail, Director of the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station\nAdvertisement\nDr Lina Bay, a principal research scientists at AIMS, says one promising area of study is what’s known as “assisted gene flow”, where the spawn of corals with better tolerance for heat could be captured and then dispersed.\n“Not all corals are created equal,” she says. “Some have a higher stress tolerance than others. Over many years we’ve shown that the variation in bleaching tolerance is hereditable – it gets passed from parents to offspring.”\nShe says these differences can exist even among the same species, meaning those corals can be selectively grown in a lab setting to promote more heat tolerance.\nAIMS scientist Dr Neal Cantin has just finished a three-year experiment with one fast-growing coral species called Pocillopora acuta, which behaves like a weed by filling in the gaps when less hardy corals die off.\nStarting with 90 parent specimens taken from three different parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Cantin and colleagues grew 7,500 offspring and then subjected them to rising levels of CO2 and temperatures of up to 2C warming.\nEven at high temperatures, some of these corals survived, and they were able to tolerate higher levels of heat as the experiment went on.\nHaving a street-fighting weedy coral like this is important, says Cantin. Dead areas of coral reefs tend to get covered in algae, but Cantin says a weedy coral that can compete with the algae can then make room for slower-growing corals to also grow.\n“The whole goal of a lot of these interventions is to work with species that can be successful on their own. We won’t be able to work with 600 species of corals, but we could probably work with 20 that fill the functional roles of a healthy reef community.\n“You can’t deny bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe and they’re impacting across a bigger area than before. We can just document that demise, or we can learn from it and have some corals for future generations.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn unbleached specimen of Acropora clathrata on the Great Barrier Reef. Photograph: Zoe Richards\nAdvertisement\nThat demise is clear and it happens at scale, and also in detail. Zoe Richards has already seen evidence of likely local extinctions of some corals at Lizard Island. One is a spiralised plate coral – Acropora clathrata – that she hasn’t been able to find for years.\n“It’s these silent extinctions that go on,” she says.\n“The entire reef is operating like one big meta population with sub-populations that are connected to each other. If you successively take out nodes in that population, sooner or later you will end up with parts that don’t connect. It will be fragmented into subsets that will continue to erode in terms of diversity. It’s degradation of the [coral] community at a very large scale.”\n‘At 3C, you basically have nothing’\nProf Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, has done pioneering work on the study of coral bleaching going back to the mid-1980s.\nHe remembers Lizard Island as a “picture perfect” place to do research on corals in the late 80s, when his research there found rising temperatures caused corals to lose their “symbionts” – the algae that lives in the coral and gives them much of their nutrients and colour.\nThe Great Barrier Reef’s first major mass bleaching event happened in 1998. There was another in 2002, and again in 2016, 2017 and 2020.\nHoegh-Guldberg says: “We knew there was a temperature effect, and we knew that temperatures were going up. At the end of the 90s, I could put those two things together.”\nThe year after the reef’s first mass bleaching, Hoegh-Guldberg took climate models to forecast that if greenhouse gas emissions kept growing then, by 2020, “the average bleaching event is likely to be similar or greater than the 1998 event”.\nAs 2020 approached, the models showed reefs across the northern, central and southern regions would see between eight and 10 bleaching events per decade.\n“I wished I’d been wrong” he says. “I think I said at the time that I’d have egg on my face if I was wrong. But there’s no egg on my face.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCorals at Lizard Island had been showing signs of recovery before this year’s bleaching. Photograph: Dr Lyle Vail, Director of the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station\nAdvertisement\nHoegh-Guldberg says manually replanting corals is uneconomic at scale but there’s merit in helping the dispersal of coral larvae, pointing to a technique being developed by a scientist at Southern Cross University that captures millions of larvae in floating pools.\nBut he says the main game is keeping global heating down.\n“Let’s say we get to 1.5C and then we can stabilise – that’s really the last call for reefs. Corals will come back and there will be winners and losers, but you’ll have a functional reef that supports fisheries and tourism.”\nThe problem is that right now, government pledges under the Paris agreement are enough to raise temperatures by 3C – not 1.5C.\n“At 2C all the reef-building corals have plummeted and instead you are looking at the dominance of other organisms like algae. At 3C you basically have nothing.\n“I’m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates,” he says. “That’s what keeps me up at night.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They weren’t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result.\n“We found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,” says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action.\nNearly one in five of Australia's big polluters breach government-set emissions limits\nRead more\nNet-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia’s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century.\nClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, Decarbonisation Futures, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 – soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C.\nThe report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020’s expected focus on climate change. The year-end UN meeting in Glasgow has been delayed until next year. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital.\nClimateWorks’ analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis.\nIt’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done. That’s why it is stimulus-friendly\nAnna Skarbek\nThe former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an “all-in” approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls “the transformational decade” before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed.\nSkarbek says it means a “make or break moment” is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready.\nAdvertisement\n“If we get this right, we can meet Australia’s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,” she says.\n“If we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don’t seize it now.”\nThe report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology.\nIt would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2.\n“It’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,” Skarbek says. “That’s why it is stimulus-friendly.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTo achieve a goal of 1.5C by 2030, three out of four cars in 2030 would have to be electric, the report says. Photograph: Uwe Meinhold/EPA\nAdvertisement\nThe analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nOn electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then.\nDeployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks’ head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas.\nOne may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a potentially plentiful clean energy source for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up.\nBut Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia’s reliance on fossil fuel exports?\nDenis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest.\n“We now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,” she says. “But we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.”\nElectricity\nAustralia's carbon emissions fall just 0.3% as industrial pollution surges\nRead more\nThe analysis found electricity is key – getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, at about 25% clean energy, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required.\nHydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed.\nThe analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity – double what the country needs – could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities.\nBuildings\nAdvertisement\nAs with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists.\nIt would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops.\nTransport\nTransport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia.\nIndustry\nIndustrial emissions have been rising rapidly in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable “residual” emissions by 2050 based on existing technology.\nImproved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts.\nAgriculture\nImmediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout.\nForestry\nReaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today’s technology, the complete eradication of CO2 is not yet possible. But the report warns this is a temporary solution. The country cannot reforest land forever, and trees are vulnerable to bushfires, drought and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,” said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni. “It will require more than just a small tweak.”\nResearchers say the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic is probably the largest annual biological carbon sequestration mechanism on the planet. Like a vast forest of tiny plants in the sunlight upper part of the ocean, they draw down carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The bigger the plankton, the higher the chance they will sink into the deep mesopelagic zone of the ocean, where carbon can be trapped for more than 1,000 years.\nUntil now, climate models have assumed that diatoms – one of the biggest types of plankton – were dominant. But the study, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology Journal, reveals they are a very minor share of biomass when compared with much smaller cyanobacteria, picophytoeukaryotes and nanophytoeukaryotes.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThis was expected in winter, but the research team found that even in spring – shortly before the annual bloom – there were far fewer diatoms in the western North Atlantic than assumed\n“We asked, how could our impressions of this ocean region be so far off?” Giovannoni said. “There are three possibilities: new equipment that allows us to see smaller plankton more clearly, the fact that previous studies had focussed on more eastern regions, and climate change altering the biology of the ocean.”\nAlthough the findings of this study of one part of the North Atlantic – much of it carried out in fierce gales – do not necessarily apply to all oceans, Giovannoni said they highlight how little is understood of marine biology, as well as the need for close-up study.\nNasa and other satellite monitoring agencies have previously used images from space to assess the carbon draw-down capacity of algae blooms, but they will need to revise the assumptions on which their calculations are based.\n• The headline on this article was amended on 4 April 2020 to make clear that the story is about the North Atlantic, not all oceans as suggested in an earlier version.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

What fossil traces will post-industrial human civilisation leave behind for the future to find? Roads and vast cities, long abandoned and forgotten, will show up as layers in the geological strata; our buried radioactive waste will still be deadly; our throwaway plastic will persist until eventually “over the coming millennia, hydrocarbons leach from the fossil plastic, accumulating in small deposits and setting in motion a slow chemical return” to its origins as oil. Future archaeologists may comment on the dreary sameness of our collective biomass: almost all of it Homo sapiens, along with the few species we like to eat. Which future archaeologists would those be, by the way? Sometimes Farrier is addressing human generations to come; at other times he’s thinking on timescales longer than any species is likely to last, let alone ours with its over-sophistication and bad habits. One microbiologist fantasises that some day a “commune of evolved bees” will encourage bee-scientists to study the Anthropocene as “a warning for all hive-kind”.\nSign up for Bookmarks: discover new books in our weekly email\nRead more\nThe transience of what appears indestructible has been a rich theme in poetry and story. The mists shift on a bleak hillside in Kurosawa’s Throne of Blood, where bloody Cobweb Castle is visible, now vanished and forgotten; Saxons write poems about stumbling on the ruins of Roman Aquae Sulis; Batman chases villains round the fallen grandeur of Gotham City. Farrier’s argument is nuanced slightly differently, channelling our contemporary angst. It’s not only that our way of life is transient. Our heedless interventions in the life of the planet – herding, ploughing, planting, building, mining, smelting, processing, communicating – have degraded its complexity and beauty in ways that will long outlast us, leaving their ineradicable taint. “We live in the shadow of an eclipse that will endure perhaps as many as ten million years before sound, shape and colour return in full to the land and the oceans.”\nAn uninitiated eye can only glide over Farrier’s summaries, adding them on to the mounting heap of glum\nThe climate and ecological crisis hurts us: and not only materially, physically. It hurts in the imagination, in the stories we tell. An idea of nature’s boundlessness, the recurring seasons, the ocean’s endless renewal – vaster than we are and cruelly, consolingly indifferent to us – has salved our private and public despairs, perhaps often almost unconsciously, through plagues and floods and wars, tragic ending after tragic ending. I remember the happiness I felt when we were shown black and white slides, in school, of the equatorial forest – much too long ago for any warning that it was threatened. My happiness didn’t make me want to go there; I just needed it to be there. Nature holds together our sense of being, organically, at the root; and it’s therefore in the roots of our language. We didn’t know how fundamental our trust was in “the treasure of nature’s germens” – that’s Macbeth invoking chaos – until news came that the treasure after all couldn’t be counted on.\nAdvertisement\nAnd therefore the language and style in which we address the crisis are all-important. Obviously there’s a first responsibility for the words to produce effects: an urgent need to change minds, change governance, change practices. And then alongside that there’s the other responsibility that words have: to put up their supple resistance to stupidity and ugliness and evil, so that our consciousness of what’s at hand has form, and we can bear it. There’s a fascinating chapter in Farrier’s book on two contrasting approaches to burying nuclear waste. How can we warn the far future not to dig where we’ve put it, when we know that the future won’t understand our language?\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nOlkiluoto nuclear power plant … the world’s first underground repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste, on the island of Eurajoki, western Finland. Photograph: Sam Kingsley/AFP/Getty Images\nNear Carlsbad, New Mexico, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant has devised a scheme that sounds like a computer game: “Five levels of warning messages, rising in complexity, and a mix of monoliths, buried clues and archives … accompanied by faces of disgust and repulsion, modelled on Edvard Munch’s The Scream … A thirty foot earthen berm, studded with magnets and radar reflectors to signal an anomaly, will enclose the inner ring of granite markers.” In Finland meanwhile, they’ve decided that “given the long lifespan” of their nuclear waste repository on Olkiluoto island – it will probably be buried at some point under another ice age – “it would be foolish to try to mark it”. They will “bury the waste in specially designed copper canisters; backfill the hole; and retreat, without leaving a single trace aboveground”; it’s meant to be forgotten. This difference, too, feels like a choice about language; it’s aesthetic as well as practical. Only one of those options is in good taste.\nFarrier’s book is full of fascinating things, yet doesn’t in its totality work for me. Its central conceit, to begin with – that idea of viewing, in some unimaginably distant future, the fossils left behind by our Anthropocene – feels strained because such a future is indeed impossible to imagine. The very terms of our love for our planet will no doubt turn out in deep time to be so much stardust – or carbon, or whatever; we can’t begin to know in what ways our depredations might matter, on the timescale proposed here. No doubt Farrier wants the future-fossil idea to work as a rhetorical device, reminding us of the sheer size of our disaster now; but the harder he works to conjure the geological scale of the problem, the more tempting it is for his language to become vatic and sententious. “Fragments of artificial glass will be glazed with cataracts, like glaucomatous eyes staring blindly into the dark.”\nBest science, nature and ideas books of 2019\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nFarrier’s a literary critic and not a scientist, and the book is intended for a lay readership; but there just isn’t room here to begin to lay out the complexities of these diverse scientific disciplines. A reader might finish his chapter on jellyfish convinced that they’re taking over the sea (“the ocean’s one lonely god will be frilled and eyeless, drifting placidly and implacably through its vast, empty dominion”), but ocean scientist Juli Berwald, in her book Spineless, resists any certainty even as to whether jellyfish numbers are on the rise. Each “ecosystem in the ocean”, she writes, “has its own unique characteristics, with distinctive vulnerabilities, threats, and resiliences”. A reader can’t conceivably do justice to the chunks of science in Footprints: the account of lateral gene-swap transfer, for instance, or palaeoclimatologists’ varying theses of the rhythms of ice ages. An uninitiated eye can only glide over Farrier’s summaries, taking what’s there on trust and adding it on to the mounting heap of glum. “The shadows are racing onwards … life is collapsing into darkness and silence.”\nIt’s not that there isn’t plenty to be glum about: glum, anxious, desperate even. We have to hope to turn this stinking, filthy tanker of our civilisation around: do something globally, for the first time ever, for our collective good. Not easy. And things won’t ever all be all right again anyway, or all pristine, even at the best – they never were. Nature itself isn’t pristine, that’s a fallacy that belongs with the dream of original sin. If it’s the right moment for jeremiads, though, let’s at least have scorching ones, and not the lyric soulfulness of an admonitory headteacher. “Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground: and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched” (Jeremiah VII, 20).\n• Footprints: In Search of Future Fossils by David Farrier is published by 4th Estate .\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

We must use this time well.”\nCurrent commitments under the Paris agreement are insufficient to meet its aims of holding the world to no more than 2C – and preferably no more than 1.5C – of heating, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. The UK, as host of the Cop26 talks, is still aiming for all countries to come forward with fresh targets on their greenhouse gas emissions.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe EU pledged it would sustain its push for a bloc-wide “green deal” that would involve stiffer cuts in emissions and a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said: “We will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious Cop26.”\nA clear benefit of moving the talks is that their original start date of 9 November was days after the US presidential election. That timing posed problems for negotiators, because Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord, a decision that will take legal effect on 4 November.\nSome observers are hoping that a new president could change the course of the world’s most powerful economy and second biggest emitter. “American voters are increasingly likely to reject Trump’s science denial on both coronavirus and climate change and instead elect Joe Biden president,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. “Delaying Cop26 until 2021 means that Biden might have the chance to re-establish US climate leadership.”\nAdvertisement\nWhether or not there is a change of administration, the delay has an advantage for countries negotiating with the US, said Nathaniel Keohane, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US.\n“Under the original schedule, the Cop was going to be overshadowed by the US elections regardless of the outcome,” explained Keohane. “The shift in schedule will allow countries to react and respond. If a Democrat wins in November, then by the time of the Cop, the US will have re-entered Paris and will be able to send a high-level political delegation, giving an important and positive boost to the talks. And if Trump is re-elected, other countries will have had time to absorb that information by the time of the Cop and know definitively that they have to move on without the US.”\nThis will be the first year in nearly three decades of annual climate negotiations under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that no talks are held.\nHowever, given the scale of the coronavirus crisis, by the end of a nearly four-hour meeting on Wednesday it was clear a decision had to be made quickly. Questions were raised over the potential problems with a postponement, in delaying vital work by countries on their emissions plans, but none of the parties objected to the final decision.\nIt may take months for a new date for Cop26 to be decided, with hopes that it could take place in early spring at the soonest. The UK is still committed to holding the summit in Glasgow, and is working with the Scottish government on logistics, and with its scientific advisers on when might be safe to hold a summit in which it is hoped civil society and activists will play a key role.\nFor now, the immediate goal of green campaigners is to ensure that recovery plans from the coronavirus crisis do not entrench investment in high emissions. There is a danger that some countries are using the pandemic to roll back environmental protections and commitments – in the US, for instance, the Trump administration has revoked clean car standards and in the EU, carmakers have lobbied for a watering down of their emissions obligations.\n“Cop26 being put on hold should make governments double down on their efforts to ensure a green and just way forward in handling this health crisis and the climate emergency,” said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. “Going back to business as usual is completely unacceptable: this pandemic shows there are huge lessons to be learned about the importance of listening to science and the need for urgent collective global action.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This administration has cleared out science and scientists across all departments. America's reputation as a competent global leader is in peril. Truth is being chased away.

Swollen rivers have been sluggishly sitting in the valley for months. Inhabitants’ attempts to protect their homes from flooding are part of a losing battle played out across the country.\nThe UK’s flooding this year is a story of desperation – but also hope, says John Hughes, development manager at Shropshire Wildlife Trust, who works in the valley. Following widespread acceptance of the climate and ecological emergency, Hughes believes people are increasingly looking to nature for solutions.\nGeorge Eustice, the environment secretary, has announced that £4bn will be spent on flood defences in the next five years and said a “big part of our focus is going to be nature-based solutions upstream”.\nAdvertisement\nHughes says: “The media normally have a distinct agenda when it comes to floods which is: ‘how miserable have you been?’ This time around the interviews I heard were talking about natural solutions and I’d never heard that before.\n“I say thanks very much Extinction Rebellion and Greta [Thunberg] – you’ve done a great job. It’s the job we’ve been trying to do for 50 years. We need to take a holistic view – land can do many, many things.”\nSoils\nIn the past, flood plains acted like sponges that soaked up water and stopped it flowing headlong into settlements downstream. Wetter habitats provided useful materials such as willow and reeds for baskets and thatched roofs. However, natural wet woodland, neutral grassland, fens and marshes were ironed out of the postwar landscape and now cover just 11% of English and Welsh flood plains. Intensive agriculture covers 70%.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe River Severn and surrounding area has been flooded for months. Photograph: John Harding\nCrops such as maize, potatoes, asparagus and onions are harvested as late as October because of the milder UK climate. This means fields are often left bare over winter months after heavy machinery has compacted the soil. This leaves the land unable to soak up so much water.\n“When you drive heavy vehicles on soggy soil you make a mess,” says John Quinton, professor of soil science at Lancaster University. “You’ve then destroyed the soil structure, and because of that water can’t get into the soil very quickly. The water runs over the surface of the soil and picks up the soil and deposits it in rivers or elsewhere. If soils are in good condition, the water will go into the soil and you will have a lot of storage.”\nAdvertisement\nScientists say creating grassland, giving land rest periods and avoiding the use of heavy machinery in flood-prone areas will reduce nutrient and sediment loss from fields. “Some groups of farmers are definitely moving in the right direction. When I started my career in the late 80s we weren’t talking about soil erosion or nutrient losses. Things are changing,” says Quinton.\nWe need to take a holistic view – land can do many, many things\nJohn Hughes, Shropshire Wildlife Trust\nExperts are only beginning to understand the complexity of soil ecosystems. In the flood-hit village of Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, farm conservation adviser Caroline Hanks compares two spadefuls of soil from the same field near her house – one from the middle of the field where intensively farmed maize was harvested in October, and the other from under tussocky grass by the hedge. The first sample is root-free and heavily compacted, meaning water cannot percolate more than eight inches below the surface. The second spadeful is crumbly, full of roots and moist throughout. The two samples look – and smell – different.\n“We’re trying to give people a visual way to assess their soil. It’s such a simple technique – you can tell so much from a spadeful of soil,” says Hanks, who specialises in advising farmers on creating flower-rich grassland. “Twenty years ago people expected us to focus on birds and hedgerows and field edges but these days getting a spade out and looking at soil is a core part of the visit.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nIntensively farmed fields are more compact, allowing less water to be absorbed. Photograph: Philip Pickin/Alamy\nAccording to Quinton’s Defra-funded research there is between three and 10 times more water run-off from compacted soils than healthy soils. “That rotten egg smell you get from compacted soils is certainly something that says to me that’s an unhealthy soil,” he says. “It shows that it’s compacted and its normal biology isn’t functioning very well. In the soil that’s aerated you’ve got fungi and bacteria which are active and sometimes after rain, you get that sweet smell of damp soil, and it’s actually a compound called geosmin.”\nCreating rough landscapes\nAdvertisement\nMany natural flood-management techniques involve reinstating features that were once common to fields such as ponds, hedges and leaky dams (either created by fallen trees or beavers). Creating buffer strips, wooded areas, drainage ditches and re-meandering rivers are all part of the toolkit. The overall effect is to give the landscape more structure and roughness to counterbalance the way industrialised farming has smoothed it out.\nThe problem is that reducing food production is currently counterintuitive to most farmers’ business plan, says Dr Marc Stutter, a soil and water scientist at the James Hutton Institute. “The biggest thing we’re fighting against is that the farmers and their fathers and grandfathers have been very proud of the way they’ve brought the land into condition for crops and quite rightfully so. Their parents have spent a lot of effort draining the land and now there’s someone telling them they want pockets of it to be wet up again.\n“If we could reverse it and say they’re not just farmers of a crop but stewards of the land then we might be able to think of water quality and flood resistance as part of their overall job.”\nNatural flood management has other benefits – planting trees and hedges helps to create vital habitats for nature and locks away carbon. Creating buffer strips along streams and rivers helps filter out pollutants and improves water quality.\nHowever, nature-based solutions are no silver bullet, according to analysis by the University of Oxford which found they would be overwhelmed by the sort of floods seen in the UK this winter.\nNot one size fits all. It must be an open discussion\nProf Hannah Cloke\nMaking the land more absorbent should be used alongside traditional “hard engineering” techniques such as flood walls, says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.\n“Putting beavers in the River Thames is not going to keep people dry and a different solution is required. However, for some of the smaller communities you could implement woody debris dams and make sure the soil upstream is able to absorb the water. Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion between farmers and Defra and the Environment Agency and scientists. It’s not an easy problem but I think we should be confident that we can solve it,” she says.\nCase studies\nIn 2015 Glenridding, a village at the bottom of Helvellyn in the Lake District, was one of many communities trashed by Storm Desmond.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGlenridding village has been trashed by multiple winter storms in recent years. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\nDanny Teasdale, a mechanic from the village, decided to do something. “Flooding isn’t going to go away, we’ve got to start looking at things. There are extreme conservationists on one side and extreme farmers on the other and they keep clashing heads and nothing happens. I sit in the middle … I know the local farmers and they trust me,” he says.\nAdvertisement\nIn the valley above the village, Teasdale created a wiggly upstream release channel that runs parallel to the river and fills up only when the river is full. He worked with the local farmer and the Environment Agency. The £6,000 project was funded by a local flood action group.\nTeasdale says: “We’ve just had really, really heavy rain with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis – I think some of the heaviest since Storm Desmond – and it didn’t flood this time. So it’s looking like it’s been helping. It goes hand in hand with hard engineering in the village but if you can slow things down upstream you don’t need to build your walls so high.”\nTeasdale’s work was so successful he created a community interest group called Ullswater Catchment Management CIC in November 2018. He has since worked in a number of different catchments around Ullswater with the Woodland Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency, including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale valley at a cost of £8,000 and a project to re-wiggle the river in Matterdale that cost £14,000.\n“It’s peanuts compared to the money that goes into hard engineering,” explains Teasdale, who says £2m has already been spent on hard flood defences in Glenridding.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLocal mechanic Danny Teasdale has worked on projects including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale. Photograph: Danny Teasdale\nAdvertisement\nElsewhere in the Lake District, the RSPB led a similar river re-wiggling scheme in Swindale valley. The work cost £200,000 and involved letting the river meander back into its old course after being straightened by hill farmers looking to dry out land hundreds of years ago. The valley is a kilometre long and the river is now 180 metres longer.\n“It’s all about holding that water in the higher catchments for longer,” says Lee Schofield, a site manager at RSPB Haweswater. “Having a wiggly river means they move more slowly. We’re delaying flood peak – it’s a low-tech solution that delivers many other benefits and makes the landscape much more resilient.”\nWiggly rivers move more slowly. We’re delaying flood peak\nLee Schofield, RSPB Haweswater\nPaul Quinn, a senior lecturer in catchment hydrology at Newcastle University, believes more drastic landscape measures, called catchment systems engineering (CSE), are needed to compensate for the fact that flood plains are already full of houses and roads. More than 40% of rivers have been deepened or modified so that they are no longer connected to their flood plains.\n“In a beautiful world that doesn’t exist, we could get our soil back into good condition and that would actually stop a lot of floods. But when the big floods come along – the kind that climate change is going to produce – soil management is not going to do it,” he says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRelief channels have been used effectively to reduce flooding in Glenridding. Photograph: Danny Teasdale\n“CSE is halfway between nature-based solutions and something that’s a bit like traditional flood management which is usually big dams, big ponds and big walls. We need to start spreading them out over the whole catchment system. It seems to me such a simple idea. It’s not rocket science, it’s about storing water – and large amounts of it – at every opportunity you can.”\nQuinn’s approach includes natural solutions as well as features such as the creation of large retention ponds and cascading channels. His team built 35 ponds and dams, and created 10 zones of oak, beech and willow plantations in the catchment attached to the village of Belford in Northumberland which has been badly affected by flooding. The scheme cost £200,000 and in the seven years since the work was completed the village has not flooded. “Every single catchment in the country will have to be done,” he says.\nWhat next?\nIn terms of soils, Quinton believes people’s attitudes are already changing: “I sense a shift in the farming community with a much greater emphasis on soils and how to sustain them. I have no evidence for this, except talking to farmers and watching Twitter. I get the feeling that there is increasing recognition that protecting soils is vital for the sustainability of the farm business.”\nAdvertisement\nFarmers think of food production as their primary motivation because that is what they have been subsidised to do. Rather than trying to farm flood-prone areas of land that don’t yield much, farmers may be subsidised to manage them for nature. Many feel the government is making the right noises with policies laid out in the new Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) – which will be fully implemented by 2028.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nProtecting soil is central to the long term sustainability of land. Photograph: Danny Teasdale\nA Defra spokesperson told the Guardian that natural flood management would be an important part of protecting the nation from flooding. “ELMS will reward farmers for the public goods that they provide, including protecting communities from environmental hazards such as flooding. Natural England and the Environment Agency do vital work and we continue to work closely with both agencies to ensure they have the right resources to continue to do so.”\nSoil management has featured prominently in ELMS – with funding set to be available for measures such as no-till agriculture and maintaining water in peat soils – but conservationists are worried that the devil is in the detail.\nTeasdale says: “I’ve seen what the government has done to Environment Agency and Natural England and what they’ve done to their budget, and it’s criminal. They’ve slashed it. ELMS could potentially be good but it needs to be funded properly and that’s what I’m not sure about. I’d love to be wrong.”\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They will now be pushed back to 2021.\nA statement from the UN on Wednesday night confirmed that the meeting of over 26,000 attendees would be delayed until next year. It said new dates for the conference would be decided in due course.\nThe UK energy minister and president of the Cop26 conference, Alok Sharma, held crunch talks with the UN and several other countries on Wednesday evening to confirm the timing of the summit. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule Cop26,” he said.\n“We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference.”\nThe Cop26 meeting was scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the SEC arena, a venue that the Scottish government plans to turn into a field hospital to treat virus victims.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to delay the vital talks because of the widespread disruption caused by coronavirus, and will also delay a key preliminary meeting scheduled for Bonn, Germany, which was also expected to be derailed by widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions.\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said it was vital that the delay should not allow governments to back down on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis. “The decision to postpone the climate talks in Glasgow was inevitable given the health emergency the world is currently facing,” he told the Guardian. “But while the summit has been delayed, the climate emergency can’t be put on hold. Government stimulus packages will hold the key as to whether this emergency significantly delays or advances progress on tackling the climate emergency.”\nSome campaigners believe there could be another advantage to delay, as the US presidential elections take place this November, just before Cop26 was scheduled to begin. With the summit delayed to next year, other governments will have time to adjust either to a second term of Donald Trump – who opposes the Paris agreement and is withdrawing the US from it – or a new president who is likely to support climate action.\nBut several prominent climate experts had feared that delaying the talks would mean governments eased off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals.\nChristiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris summit in 2015, had argued for keeping Glasgow on track. On Wednesday night she accepted the delay but added: “Emissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5C and the Paris agreement set the Cop26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.”\nThe Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s CEO, said investors would support the decision because it “improves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis”.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nBut the delay will come as a blow to some climate campaigners, who have urged the UK government to proceed with the conference despite the outbreak to avoid stalling progress on global climate action. They believe since the Paris agreement, countries have failed to develop climate commitments that go far enough to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown. The Glasgow talks aim to galvanise tougher plans to cap rising temperatures by limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan.\nThrough rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas.\nThe scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world’s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.\n“We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.”\nProf Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.\n“One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFishing below an ocean’s maximum yield allows faster recovery of fish stocks. Photograph: Manu San Felix/NG/KAUST\nThe review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored.\nAmong the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring.\n“We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,” said Roberts.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHowever, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited.\n“The Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,” said Roberts. “And there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.”\nThe global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help.\nThe Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHealthy coral reefs are highly productive and support high biomasses of top predators. Photograph: Manu San Felix/NG/KAUST\nBut examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran.\n“When I started working on the science of marine protected areas in the early 1990s. it was very much a niche interest,” said Roberts. “Now it’s being discussed at the top level internationally and we have many countries signing up to expand protection to 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, with the UK among the early adopters of the target.” Marine protected areas have risen from 0.9% of the ocean in 2000 to 7.4% now, though not all are fully implemented.\nThe scientists’s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: “Meeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity’s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They [airlines] are worried about survival and will need lots of support, lots of liquidity – that gives them a big responsibility.”\nA group of 26 civil society groups in the UK have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, demanding “stringent conditions” on any rescue, including strict targets on greenhouse gases in line with the Paris agreement and measures to help workers. “Public money must be used to address social and environmental priorities, as well as economic needs,” they wrote.\nAviation has all but ceased in some countries and flights are vastly down in most others, owing to the lockdowns and other suppression measures. Airlines have been appealing to governments for bailouts as fleets have been grounded.\nBut campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring.\nIn their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners – including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice – call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers’ rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a “just transition” for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nThey also want a new fiscal regime that includes a frequent flyer levy or air miles levy, replacing air passenger duty, which would reduce demand without removing access to flights from those with limited alternatives or limited resources, by shifting the tax burden to frequent leisure flyers. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year, but 1% of people take a fifth of all flights.\nRebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: “Emergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers’ rights, prevent public money from being diverted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.”\nAttaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Cañete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. “Market mechanisms are needed,” he said.\nAirlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. “The UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the only national aviation industry to do so,” said a spokesperson. “This will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.”\nAirlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. Electric planes are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream.\n“We need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,” said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. “We need more proactive thinking from airlines – they can’t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.”\nThe coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people’s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future.\nQuick guide\n8 ways to offset your carbon emissions\nShow\nThese eight companies\nThese eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions.

Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects.\nBefore the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects.\nChoosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 – meaning Corsia’s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

These fertile meadows were highly prized, and the Norman lords who owned them used the hay crop to help fund Hereford’s cathedrals, churches and castles. The secret to their wonderful bounty was the River Lugg flowing through the middle, fertilising the valley floor with lime and silt each winter it flooded.\nBut this longstanding system is broken. This winter the valley was submerged under several feet of chocolate-coloured water. It has been flooded almost continuously since October, turning the 120-hectare (297-acre) reserve into an inland lake, with just the tops of gates and fence posts peeping out of the water. Now, as spring approaches, the water is still several inches deep and swans and gulls frolic where mice and rabbits would have burrowed six months earlier.\nThe damage flooding does to humans has been well-documented, but wildlife populations are unseen casualties, with some ecosystems taking decades to recover. “It is frightening to think that we have only just begun to see what might be ahead with our climate. The losses could be profound,” says James Hitchcock from Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the Lugg reserve.\nAdvertisement\n“The rate of change we are seeing and the repetition in extreme events is coming too fast for wildlife to adapt … The loss of these meadows could take years and years to reverse and we may never see a return of some species.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLugg wildflower meadows in Herefordshire are home to rare species of plants such as the ‘Snakeskin’ flower. Photograph: Holden Landscapes/Alamy\nDamage to wetland habitats\nMonths of flooding is turning Lugg meadows anoxic as oxygen is lost. Worms and other insects suffocate and come to the surface where they are picked off by scavengers such as foxes and crows, reducing the larder of food for rarer species that rely on the reserve in spring. Many delicate grass species like vernal grass and red fescue are likely to be weakened by the floods, leaving a flush of resistant weed species such as thuggish dock leaves and thistles to take their place. In 2012, conservationists resorted to weedkiller to get rid of the dock leaves because the valley had been too wet.\nThese meadows are highly valuable sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and were home to Herefordshire’s only fledged curlew chick last year. Curlews and other ground-nesting birds such as skylarks and reed buntings will have nowhere to nest unless the water subsides in the next week or so. The rare solitary red-shanked carder bee, which nests in mouseholes in tussocky vegetation, could already be wiped out. If flooding becomes too frequent, meticulously managed flood plains like this turn into swamps.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBombus ruderarius (Red-shanked carder bee), formerly widespread in the area. Photograph: Steven Falk/Courtesy of CEH\nAdvertisement\nThe casualties are far-reaching – otters that live in the Lugg have been killed on roads after being forced into areas where there is less cover. Kingfisher nests normally built into the muddy banks have been submerged under several feet of water. Soil in the water also chokes filter feeders such as dragonfly and damsel larva.\nThe decline of this rural valley, once rich in meaning and memories, is part of what Hitchcock calls the “homogenisation of the countryside”. All over the country, generalist species like rooks, crows and gulls thrive at the expense of specialised species that are picky about their habitat. Only around 1,200 hectares of species-rich flood plain meadows remain in the whole of the UK, with most of them lost due to the intensification of agriculture. Many of these rare species have nowhere to migrate to if their habitat is destroyed.\n“This flooding is one element in a general narrative of decline. When flooding is this prolonged, insects and vertebrates start to die and that includes things like earthworms. It then takes years to recover. In that intervening period you have less food for birds and potentially the loss of some species. Everything is getting hit from every angle,” says Hitchcock.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA series of storms over the winter of 2019-20 caused repeated flooding in Herefordshire. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty\nAdvertisement\nFarther down the Lugg at Bodenham Lake, prolonged flooding may have drowned 1,500 young reeds, planted in 2019 as part of a £520,000 project managed by the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust to create more habitats for declining wetland species such as warblers and bearded tits.\nSophie Cowling, senior project officer at Lugg Living Landscape, says: “The lake’s water levels have been extremely high since the end of October, due to repeated flooding. The floodwaters have fully submerged the young reed plants; if they drown it will be costly to replace them and the conservation of declining wildlife that relies on reedbeds will be delayed by several years.”\nDamage to river ecosystems\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThirty miles south-west is the village of Llanwenarth in the Abergavenny district in Monmouthshire, Wales. Two 16th-century manor houses and a church perched on land raised from the flood plain are a nod to former rural communities that once thrived in these valleys. The 16th-century houses had never flooded until earlier this year when they had three feet of water running through. The damage to the valley exceeded the three previous large floods in 1853, 1947 and 1979.\nFortunately these floods were not at a time when fish were spawning but their regularity worries Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye and Usk Foundation. “In the Usk we’ve had record floods in 2018, 2019 and now in 2020. That’s three massive floods in the last 20 months. Imagine each one as a bang on the ecology – if you keep hitting it it just goes away. Rivers just cannot survive flood after flood after flood.”\nAdvertisement\nFast-moving water causes gravel at the bottom of rivers – which is key for river ecosystems – to be ripped away and spat out farther downstream. Macroinvertebrates such as bull head, stone larch and marsh brown lose their homes, says Evans. “These animals are the life-support systems in the river. They provide food for the dippers and the fish, which provide food for the kingfisher, so if you don’t have the macroinvertebrates because you have taken away their houses then your whole ecology is done.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA lack of macroinverterbrates means less food for fish, which means less food for kingfishers. Photograph: Fred van Wijk/Alamy\nOn a tributary of the Llynfi, only the red bedrock is visible and the gravel patches where salmon and trout previously spawned have washed away. A single flood can impact populations for decades to come; the 1977 flood at Selkirk in the Scottish Borders washed away salmon eggs that had just been laid in the gravel and the effects were apparent on spring salmon catches in the River Tweed 25 years later, according to Evans.\nIn September 2012 more than 200,000 tonnes of soil left the Lugg in one flood, the equivalent of 26 hectares of top soil. There is up to 150mg of soil per litre of water in many of these rivers, and roads are visibly stained red after the water has subsided. This is caused by water flooding agricultural land – much of which is bare after being harvested for maize or root vegetables – and washing valuable topsoil into rivers. This soil is often doused in pesticides and fertilisers which cause additional damage to river ecosystems.\n“Our rivers are not adapted to these elevated sediment loads, and our ecology is not adapted to elevated sediment loads. We should not see big brown rivers sliding past but what we see is big brown rivers sliding past and that’s because of how we manage our land. We’ve got this shifting baselines thing going on – people think the Lugg has always been brown but it hasn’t,” says Evans.\nEggs in the gravel rely on flowing water to bring them oxygen and remove waste, but soil blocks up these holes and reduces the amount of water reaching the eggs, meaning they can suffocate and die. It also reduces visibility so river creatures cannot hunt so easily.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRecord-breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth in February Photograph: David Cheshire/Alamy\nDivided communities\nAdvertisement\nHistorically these traditional farming communities would have been centres for human trade, migration and settlement, but the battle to control water is dividing communities. Tris Pearce, an ecologist and trustee of the Badger Trust, grew up in the Welsh borders where the Severn and Vyrnwy rivers meet. He monitors badger setts near Pentre, Shrewsbury, which sits close to the border between England and Wales. Here, the roads have turned into rivers intersected with islands of tarmac. Some areas have been underwater for more than three and a half months.\nFor badgers, late winter storms come at the worst time because cubs are in underground dens and will drown unless the sow can get them out (which she does by picking them up in her mouth one by one). Pearson feels increasingly concerned about the future of these valleys for both the wildlife and people that live here. His parents were farmers and Pearson kept livestock himself but two years ago turned vegan due to concerns about the environmental impacts of livestock farming.\n“Climate change is the big thing. We can’t keep ignoring it. You look up at the overgrazed hillside from six feet of water and everything you can see is being propped up by government money. It’s not sustainable. This prolonged flooding is starting to turn into an annual event – it was once in a lifetime, then once every decade and now it’s all the time.”\nSamantha Somers, environment manager at Natural England, says the organisation will continue to support natural flood management measures, including creating space for temporary ponds and restoring rivers.\n“Recent flooding unfortunately caused significant distress and disruption for communities and businesses. However as flooding is a natural process, flood plains can generally continue to support ecosystems which are rich in wildlife and can accommodate floodwaters when rivers burst their banks,” she says.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It faces the gravest challenge in its 100-year history, they say, one that will permanently alter the industry. With some calling the scene a “hellscape”, the least lurid description is “unprecedented”.\nA key question is whether this will permanently alter the course of the climate crisis. Many experts think it might well do so, pulling forward the date at which demand for oil and gas peaks, never to recover, and allowing the atmosphere to gradually heal.\nThe boldest say peak fossil fuel demand may have been dragged into the here and now, and that 2019 will go down in history as the peak year for carbon emissions. But some take an opposing view: the fossil fuel industry will bounce back as it always has, and bargain basement oil prices will slow the much-needed transition to green energy.\nWho is right depends on a heady mix of geopolitics, profit, investor sentiment, government bailouts and net zero emissions targets, campaigner pressures and, not least, consumer behaviour – is virtual working, for instance, the new normal?\nWhat is beyond doubt is the carnage in the sector. The lowest oil prices for almost two decades, with worse potentially on the way. Some oil major stock market valuations halved since January. At least two-thirds of annual investment – $130bn – dumped and tens of thousands of job losses. In a few markets prices have gone negative – sellers will pay you to take the oil, as global storage capacity fills.\n“The price war and Covid-19 have really thrown the oil and gas sector into turmoil, and now we have companies really in survival mode,” said Valentina Kretzschmar, director of corporate research at analysts Wood Mackenzie.\nOil wells responsible for almost 1m barrels a day may have already been shut down because the price of oil is now lower than the cost of shipping it, according to US banking giant Goldman Sachs, with the number of wells growing “by the hour”. This is likely to “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics” and “shift the debate around climate change”, said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities at the bank.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nDemand for oil has plummeted as the coronavirus locks down people in their homes and airplanes on runways. “The virus will bring forward peak demand for fossil fuels,” said Kingsmill Bond, at analysts Carbon Tracker. This latest cyclical oil shock is hitting an industry already heading towards a structural peak created by nations committing to net zero future emissions, he said.\n“As for the impact of the virus on the timing [of peak demand], it depends of course on the severity,” he said. In 2018, Carbon Tracker estimated peak demand would come in 2023 but Bond said it was possible that the crisis has advanced this by three years. “That means that peak emissions was almost certainly 2019, and perhaps peak fossil fuels as well,” he said. “It will be touch and go if there can be another mini-peak in 2022, before the inexorable decline begins.”\nAdvertisement\nWhile the oil companies themselves have long argued peak demand is too far off to put a number on, most observers thought it would happen this decade. Mark Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, agreed the crises could bring it closer.\n“When the dust settles, the peak demand narrative will be there stronger than ever,” he said. “This is particularly true if long-haul aviation fails to recover. This has been a very strong source of oil demand growth in recent years but the longer we are at home – remote working, using video conferencing – the more people will wonder: do we really need to get on a plane?”\nEnd of an era?\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe price of petrol displayed at a fraction of a penny under £1/litre at Costo’s filling station in Birmingham. Photograph: Morgan Harlow/PA\nThe oil price plunge has also demolished the lucrative returns on exploration projects to which investors have become accustomed. This threatens what Lewis calls the “golden dividend era” of the last two decades, which has made oil stocks mainstays of portfolios.\nWood Mackenzie last week analysed the impact of an oil price of $35 on companies’ previous investment plans for 2020. “It’s a very, very ugly picture,” said Kretzschmar. “At $35 per barrel, 75% of projects don’t even cover the cost of capital.”\nMost strikingly, the fat rates of return projected for the oil and gas projects have slumped from about 20% down to 6%, she said. “They’re very much in line now with what you can get from solar and wind projects.”\n“The oil and gas sector is already a very much unloved sector by investors and in this kind of oil price environment, it becomes low return, high risk and high carbon,” Kretzschmar said. “It is not a very attractive proposition.” With oil prices predicted by some to collapse even further, Kretzschmar is blunt: “At $20 [the industry] will be decimated.”\nAdvertisement\nThe oil industry was already under pressure from investors concerned about the climate crisis and increasing regulation from governments to cut emissions. Colin Melvin, at Arkadiko Partners, a consultancy advising some of the world’s biggest investment management and pension funds, said that after the crisis he expects investment to flow increasingly towards companies perceived to offer wider social benefits.\n“The purpose of the investment of capital in business is to create wellbeing, to create wealth in the true sense, and I think that is going to become more and more relevant to investors,” he said.\nAdam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England pensions board, said the implications for the oil and gas sector could be significant. “[Demand reduction] could be the catalyst for rapid change and I think investors are going to look at long term systemic challenges very closely and want to see much greater resilience.”\nAs well as climate concerns, the wild instability of the oil markets provoked by the crises may also deter investors, according to analysis from the University of Oxford’s Institute for Energy Studies: “This is a market that is being tested to its limits.”\nHowever, not all experts think the oil industry’s loss is necessarily a gain for green energy and the climate. “If anything it may hold up the share of oil for longer, because it’s cheaper. It could be bad news from a climate point of view,” said Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford.\nHe said securing a green economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis will require deliberate policy measures from governments: “This is where the carbon tax comes in. Now is the moment.”\n‘Historic opportunity’\nGovernments are deploying stupendous sums to stimulate the coronavirus-wracked global economy - $5 trillion from the G20 nations alone - but how it is disbursed remains uncertain. European Union leaders have promised to make their emergency measures align with their Green Deal programme and Fatih Birol, executive director at the International Energy Agency, has said there is an “historic opportunity” to pour investment into energy technologies that cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut the $2tn US coronavirus relief package is doling out $60bn to struggling airlines and offering low-interest loans that are available to fossil fuel companies, without requiring any action to stem the climate emergency. The Canadian government has said it will give loans to its oil companies, who say they are on “life support”.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAerial view of the Noor 3 solar power station which is nearing completion, near Ouarzazate, southern Morocco in 2017. Photograph: Abdeljalil Bounhar/AP\nAdvertisement\nAfter the 2008 global financial crisis, there were high hopes that the trillions of dollars delivered at that time would green the economy, but fossil fuels and their emissions powered on, ever upwards. Bond said: “The big difference to 2008 is that the cost of renewables is now below that of fossil fuels. There is no point trying to sustain the unsustainable high-cost fossil assets in any event. It would be deeply ironic for [neoliberal] advocates of Ayn Rand to ask for a government bailout.”\nAdrienne Buller, an economist at the Common Wealth thinktank, said governments in countries like the UK, US and Canada should now consider nationalising major oil corporations.\n“Fossil fuel companies won’t be allowed to fail en masse.\nAny bailout should at a bare minimum come with equivalent public stakes in the companies, and strong conditions for environmental and climate protections and a transition away from fossil fuel production.\n“However, given the intent of acquiring this stake should be to wind down production as rapidly as feasible while ensuring a just transition for workers and security of energy supply, nationalisation may be more appropriate and pragmatic.”\nThe global industry trade body, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, insists its members have a vital role after the pandemic. “Oil and gas play a significant role in the global energy mix and will do so in the future,” said a spokesman. “It is too early to predict what the midterm impact will be. But the oil and gas industry has a history of successfully responding to difficult situations and we anticipate that it will adapt as it has before.”\n“Furthermore, the industry has been a key engine of prosperity and a driver of innovation for many decades,” he said. “It has the experience, skills, knowledge and resources needed to realise a low-emissions energy future - a transition that would be more difficult and more expensive without it.”\n‘Saudi Arabia is desparate to cash out’\nAdding fuel to the fire of the pandemic is the price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, who increased production just as the pandemic slashed demand, sending prices towards the floor. The moves are seen as an attempt to grab market share by killing the higher cost producers behind the US shale boom.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSaudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nProf Bernard Haykel, at Princeton University, US, said it also reflects a more fundamental strategic shift led by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman: “With a global clean-energy transition inevitable, he is desperate to cash out while the Kingdom still can.”\nThe lasting impact of the price war depends on how long Saudi Arabia and Russia can keep pumping cheap oil. While their production costs are very low, they depend on high revenues to balance their national budgets.\nMichael Liebreich, at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the fiscal break-even for Saudi Arabia is around $80 per barrel, meaning its foreign exchange reserves might sustain rock-bottom oil prices for only two or three years. “Russia, with a $40 a barrel fiscal break-even and much more diversified economy, can survive low oil prices for a decade,” he said.\nWhatever happens, the industry will never be the same again after the double whammy of the pandemic and price war. “The companies that emerge from the crisis will not be the ones that went into it,” said Carbon Tracker’s Bond. “We will see write-downs, restructuring and radical change.”\nExperts, including Currie at Goldman Sachs, say the climate change debate will almost certainly take a difference course after the crisis. But exactly what that looks like remains to be seen. “The question is how long this is all going to last, and no one really knows,” said Kretzschmar.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth.

In that analysis, Long-Bailey and Nandy both came out with the maximum score of 100%. Starmer had only been present for two votes, meaning there was insufficient information for him to be given a score.\nIn a clear sign of how deeply embedded a radical environmental agenda has become in Labour policy, all three candidates, answering before the Covid 19 outbreak said the climate crisis was the biggest challenge facing the UK. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy highlighted their previous experience – Long-Bailey as the architect of Labour’s Green New Deal at the last election and Nandy from her time as the party’s shadow energy secretary and her role leading Labour’s team at the Paris climate talks in 2015.\nThe Green New Deal\nAll the candidates pledged broad support for Labour’s comprehensive Green New Deal agenda. Both Long-Bailey and Starmer supported the specifics of the plan set out in the 2019 manifesto, spelling out how the UK could rapidly decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of secure, unionised green jobs.\nStarmer said the project should be “hardwired” into everything a future Labour government did “from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing”, and he flagged up the role of the “green transformation fund and a national investment bank” to pay for it.\nAdvertisement\nLong-Bailey said that under her leadership Labour would organise and pay for such an ambitious scheme through public ownership and investment in the energy system to ensure “extra costs are not loaded onto homes that can’t afford it”.\nNandy did not commit to the details of the plan but agreed there needed to be “a wholesale transformation” in the way homes and businesses were powered and heated, adding that “this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities”.\nPublic transport\nAsked whether they would commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building, Long-Bailey said she would, saying it was necessary not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to improve “our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.”\nNeither Nandy nor Starmer specifically committed to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than roads although both said they would increase investment in those areas.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nNandy said she would nationalise the railways and hand over control of buses to local councils so they were run “for people not profit”.\nStarmer said the government had made a “political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport”.\nHe added: “I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.”\nAirport expansion and frequent flyer tax\nAll the candidates expressed interest in a frequent flyer tax to ensure that the 15% of wealthy UK residents who are estimated to take 70% of domestic and international flights pay more for the environmental damage they cause.\nNandy said she would look to “make the system fairer and greener”. Long-Bailey said it was right to “ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights”.\nStarmer said the tax system should encourage people to use alternatives to flying.\nAll three said they were opposed to expansion at Heathrow and were sceptical about aviation expansion elsewhere in light of the UK’s legal commitments to reduce carbon emissions.\nNuclear power\nAdvertisement\nNone of the candidates came out against nuclear power. Long-Bailey said she supported it where necessary for the UK’s “energy security”. Nandy said that the middle of a climate emergency was the wrong time to rule it out definitively. Starmer said nuclear power should be “part of the mix” in the transition away from fossil fuels, but the “overwhelming focus” should be on renewables.\nRed meat\nAsked whether they would support policies to reduce red meat consumption, Nandy said the focus should be on the fossil fuel industry. “The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.”\nLong-Bailey highlighted the growing number of people who are cutting down on red meat “as people think about the environment and their health”, but stopped short of any specific policy commitments.\nStarmer acknowledged that the meat and dairy sector was “one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, deforestation”, adding that everyone should think about how to reduce their consumption.\nBut he added: “Changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change.”\nRewilding and biodiversity\nNandy said tackling the climate emergency went “hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment”. She backed Labour’s existing policy of creating 10 new national nature parks, adding: “I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.”\nStarmer agreed rewilding was an essential part of the “fightback against the climate and environmental emergency”.\n“I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets.”\nLong-Bailey also backed Labour’s existing plans to create new parks and rewild existing ones, as well as “natural corridors” across the country.\n“These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand. This resonated with so many readers around the world. We promise to update you on the steps we take to hold ourselves accountable at this defining point in our lifetimes. With climate misinformation rife, and never more dangerous than now, the Guardian's accurate, authoritative reporting is vital – and we will not stay quiet.\nYou've read 115 articles in the last six months. We chose a different approach: to keep Guardian journalism open for all. We don't have a paywall because we believe everyone deserves access to factual information, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.\nOur editorial independence means we are free to investigate and challenge inaction by those in power. We will inform our readers about threats to the environment based on scientific facts, not driven by commercial or political interests. And we have made several important changes to our style guide to ensure the language we use accurately reflects the environmental emergency.\nThe Guardian believes that the problems we face on the climate crisis are systemic and that fundamental societal change is needed.

Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour’s priority for the duration of this parliament?\nRebecca Long-Bailey\nThe climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy.\nAs leader I will continue the work I’ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition.\nAdvertisement\nAs a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump’s climate crisis denial when our country hosts Cop26 this year.\nLisa Nandy\nYes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country’s economic and foreign policies.\nOne of the first things I did on becoming Labour’s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert’s book, Field Notes From A Catastrophe. It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn’t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we’ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don’t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too.\nQ&A\nWhat is the European Green Deal?\nShow\nThe European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy.\nAs well as the long-trailed goal of enshrining in law a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, the plan will propose cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). The current target is 40%\nMaking trade deals only with countries that stick to their climate targets under the Paris agreement\nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy laws will be tightened up to reflect the more demanding climate targets\nTo avoid penalising European steelmakers and other industry who are cleaning up their act, non-EU competitors importing energy-intensive goods could face a tax, known as “a carbon border adjustment mechanism”\nUsing EU funds to develop a zero carbon steel industry by 2030.\nCar and truck makers will have to do more to curb emissions, while the EU will seek to boost funding for electric vehicle charge points. Container and cruise ships, currently a gaping hole in efforts to tackle the climate emergency, will be brought into Europe’s emissions trading system, meaning maritime companies will probably have to buy pollution permits\nA new strategy to protect European nature, as well as plans to plant and restore forests. Also proposed are plans to improve air and water quality, as well as a review that could lead to tightening of industrial pollution laws\nTargets to cut pesticides, chemical fertilisers and increase the area of land devoted to organic farming will be part of an overhaul of the EU’s €59bn a year common agricultural policy\nA plan to raise a €100bn “just transition fund” from public and private sources to help EU member states move beyond fossil fuels\nThe European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs; money will have to be raised; plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out.\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nKier Starmer\nYes – and for the next parliament when we are in government. We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing.\n2. As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples?\nRLB\nAs leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAt the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted.\nAs Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign – lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election.\nQ&A\nWhat is Labour's 'green new deal'\nShow\nLabour's 'green new deal' - or 'green industrial revolution' - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport, tackling the UK’s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model.\nAlthough the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits in the medium term, positioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years.\nCrucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by – among others – those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure.\nLabour's manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its 2019 election campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US 2020 race. Internationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west’s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants.\nMatthew Taylor\nWas this helpful?\nLN\nAs shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street.\nAdvertisement\nKS\nThe climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power – from councils, city mayors to devolved governments – as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030.\nWe need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives.\nWe must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs – not the unambitious targets they have set themselves.\n3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to:\n• Retrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament?\n• Producing 90% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030?\n• Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen?\nRLB\nYes, I commissioned the expert report, Thirty by 2030 (pdf), these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do – but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better.\nInsulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless – we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country.\nLN\nI know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change.\nKS\nAdvertisement\nI fully support Labour’s Green New Deal and the proposals for a Green Transformation Fund (pdf) and a National Investment Bank (pdf). The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party.\n4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised?\nRLB\nThese are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can’t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain.\nIt’s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can’t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people’s homes and the quality of jobs we create.\nWhen it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world’s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains.\nLN\nI would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I’m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What’s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that’s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved.\nAdvertisement\nKS (see previous answer)\n5. How will you ensure the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis?\nRLB\nFor too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism.\nFor example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions.\nInternationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger – as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home.\nSocial justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN’s green climate fund, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south.\nLN\nIt’s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe’s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain’s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused.\nAdvertisement\nKS\nThe Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget – and work for greater international financial assistance – to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies.\n6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded?\nRLB\nI support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK’s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities.\nLisa Nandy\nI’m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now – right in the middle of a climate emergency – is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this.\nKS\nI support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy.\n7. Do you support HS2?\nRLB\nYes. The government’s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK’s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures.\nAdvertisement\nLN\nThe government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead.\nKS\nIf we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north.\n8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion?\nRLB\nLabour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour’s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them.\nLN\nI voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners’ air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can’t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the Committee on Climate Change in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments.\nKS\nAdvertisement\nI voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don’t think that’s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I’ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests.\n9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour’s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals?\nRLB\nYes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.\nLN\nTackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents’ income.\nSo I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.\nRewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap.\nKS\nRewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution.\n10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme?\nAdvertisement\nRLB\nI support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a “public money for public goods” approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest £3.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime.\nLN\nIt’s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers’ cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way.\nKS\nTrees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK’s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change.\n11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take?\nRLB\nGrowing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It’s been really positive how we’ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can’t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone.\nLN\nThe priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.\nIn my view this is not about telling people what to eat – it’s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful.\nKS\nAfter fossil fuels, the food industry – particularly the meat and dairy sector – is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That’s why I support Labour’s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency.\n12. Do you support a frequent flyer tax to reduce air travel?\nRLB\nAt the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less – they shouldn’t be unfairly taxed. We don’t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change.\nLN\nIt cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener.\nKS\nAir travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that.\n13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building?\nRLB\nYes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons – not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.\nLN\nIt is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport – and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes.\nKS\nThe government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.\n14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution?\nRLB\nYes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization’s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour’s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain.\nLN\nIt is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can’t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan’s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees’s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading.\nKS\nAir pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones.\n15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages?\nRLB\nYes. I stand by Labour’s 2019 commitment to invest an additional £5.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories.\nClimate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK’s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies.\nBetter insulated homes, delivered through Labour’s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter.\nLN\nShort-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We’re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences.\nKS\nAs demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs – but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal.\n16. What direct diplomacy should Labour undertake with international partners to help make Cop26 a success?\nRLB\nThe eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26.\nLN\nI was proud to lead Labour’s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full.\nAcross the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them.\nAhead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London’s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement.\nKS\nWe know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I’m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations.\n17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal?\nRLB\nLabour’s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage.\nLN\nI have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality.\nKS\nWe need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

And to deal with the climate emergency we need to leave the vast majority of the world’s coal in the ground,” he added.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nThe plan was rejected two years ago by Sajid Javid, the former minister for communities and local government, after an 18-month review concluded that the environmental impact of the mine would outweigh its economic benefits.\nThe decision was overturned by the High Court eight months later after a judge ruled that Javid’s reasoning for disregarding the support of the planning inspectorate, which backed the project, was “significantly inadequate”.\nThe Banks Group argues that mining coal domestically would have a smaller carbon footprint than importing coal by sea and rail. The same argument was put forward in favour of UK shale gas development, but failed to win over energy ministers who announced an indefinite moratorium on all fracking in England last year.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But the much-celebrated small bird with a beautiful song may be increasingly endangered because its wings are getting shorter.\nThe nightingale makes an epic journey from sub-Saharan Africa to breed in Europe each summer but there are barely 7,000 nesting pairs left in England.\nSpanish researchers examining wing sizes of two nightingale populations in central Spain have found that the average wing length relative to their body size has fallen over the past two decades. Shorter-winged birds were found to be less likely to return to their breeding grounds after their first trip to Africa.\nAccording to a new study published in The Auk: Ornithological Advances, natural selection driven by climate change is causing the birds to evolve with shorter wings.\nIn recent decades, the timing of spring has shifted in central Spain and summer droughts have become longer and more intense, leaving the nightingales a shorter window in which to raise their young.\nScientists believe that there is a suite of adaptations that make the nightingales effective migratory birds including a long wingspan, a larger clutch size and a shorter lifespan, which are controlled by a set of linked genes. This means that selective pressure on one trait also affects the other features.\nIf the pressure of drought is leading the most successful birds to lay smaller clutches of eggs, with fewer young to feed, then it could be causing these nightingales to also lose the other linked traits that make them such effective migrants. This is an example of “maladaptation” where species’ responses to cope with changing conditions end up causing them harm.\nGarden birdwatching: the wildlife travel drama on your doorstep\nRead more\n“There is much evidence that climate change is having an effect on migratory birds, changing their arrival and laying dates and their physical features over the last few decades,” said lead author Carolina Remacha of Complutense University of Madrid.\n“If we are to fully understand how bird populations adapt to new environments in order to help them tackle the challenges of a rapidly changing world, it is important to call attention to the potential problems of maladaptive change.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The latest bleaching on the reef has hit during this cycle’s neutral phase.\n“The real concern is with this much bleaching without tropical forcing,” Eakin said. “This may be a sign we’ve now tipped over to near-annual bleaching in many locations.”\nGreat Barrier Reef’s latest bleaching confirmed by marine park authority\nRead more\n“It’s quite concerning that we are getting this much heat stress across the Great Barrier Reef in an Enso [El Niño southern oscillation]-neutral year.\n“What we are seeing on the Great Barrier Reef and potentially elsewhere is really being driven just by anthropogenic climate change.\n“If we get another El Niño, the odds are almost 100% that we will see another global bleaching event.”\nAerial surveys of 1,020 individual reefs completed across the length of the 2,300km marine park confirmed last week a third mass bleaching event in only five years.\n“That’s already pushing awfully close to near-annual bleaching,” added Eakin.\nCorals bleach when they sit in abnormally hot water for too long. Reefs and corals can recover from mild bleaching, but severe and prolonged heat stress can kill corals.\nIn back-to-back bleaching in 2016 and 2017, about half the reef’s corals died.\nEakin said that in January Coral Reef Watch’s models were warning that heat stress would build across the reef in February and March. Sea temperatures over the Great Barrier Reef were the highest on record this February.\nSatellite data later confirmed the modelling results which, Eakin said, was received “with a sense of dread” among scientists.\n“I was not ready to have another bleaching event this quickly,” he said.\nEakin said the agency’s modelling for the next four months was showing a “classic pattern of heat stress” that had preceded previous global bleaching events.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHeat was predicted to rise first in the southern Indian Ocean, then to south-east Asia and into the Coral Triangle.\nHe said it was “too early” to say if a global bleaching event was on the way, but “it would not really surprise me”.\nEakin said that when severe bleaching causes mass mortality of corals, “those events take a decade or more for recovery. We are seeing these events far too frequently”.\nAs the planet gains heat from increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, about 90% of that extra heat is taken up by oceans. In January, a study of heat down to 2km in depth concluded that 2019 was the warmest year on record.\nEakin said ocean heat content data showed the world’s oceans were gaining heat. “There’s so much heat that has been absorbed in the upper ocean that all the coral reefs are much closer now to their bleaching threshold. As result, it’s very easy to tip them over.”\nData from nine days of aerial surveys over the Great Barrier Reef, carried out in mid-March, are being analysed and compiled at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University.\nDr Neal Cantin, a senior coral biologist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said because of the warming of the oceans caused by climate change, “we are already committed to more frequent and more severe bleaching in the next decade”.\nAdvertisement\nCantin said the Australian Institute of Marine Science would be carrying out monitoring of sites in the coming months to see which corals had survived this event and how 2020 had impacted recovery from previous bleaching.\n“We need to understand the full extent of significant mortality,” he said.\n'Probably the worst year in a century': Australia's environmental toll of 2019\nRead more\nMany areas of the Great Barrier Reef are known to have experienced severe bleaching this summer, likely killing many corals, but others, including tourist reefs near Cairns and the Whitsundays, only experienced mild bleaching. Most offshore reefs in the far north escaped bleaching entirely.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nScientists fear images of heat-stressed, bleached coral at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef taken in February could be the start of another mass bleaching event. Photograph: Dr Lyle Vail, Director of the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station\n“With mild bleaching, the animal survives but growth is slowed and they become more susceptible to disease,” said Associate Prof Tracy Ainsworth at the University of New South Wales.\nShe said mild bleaching can also impact the ability of the corals to spawn which can slow recovery from impacts.\n“We have known for 20 years that probably by about 2020, we would start to see annual bleaching.”\nEakin added: “Even if the corals don’t die, bleached corals are injured and starving and they are more susceptible to disease. They will also reduce their reproductive output in a bleaching year and the year after.”\nA 2019 study found bleaching in 2016 and 2017 had caused the numbers of new baby corals produced in 2018 to crash by 89%.\nCantin said that unlike in 2016 and 2017, the bleaching in 2020 appeared to have covered “the entire system” of the Great Barrier Reef.\nGreat Barrier Reef world heritage values damaged by climate change, government admits\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nCorals have a symbiotic relationship with algae that delivers nutrients and colour to the animal.\n“Completely white coral means it has lost probably 95-100% of their symbiont algae and they will struggle to recover,” Cantin said.\n“With moderate-level bleaching you will see the tips go white with some sections still having pigmentation left – they do have a good chance of surviving,” he said.\nThe Great Barrier Reef’s values as a world heritage-listed location are due for review at a meeting scheduled in China in June. Unesco has said that meeting is under review due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, Australia submitted a report to the committee that conceded climate change had impacted the reef’s values as a world heritage site since it was first listed in 1981.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Some companies were required to offset their excess emissions; they paid $863,860 in total.\nSmoke screen: how Australia's biggest polluters have been free to increase emissions\nRead more\nGavan McFadzean, ACF’s climate change program manager, said not requiring industrial polluters to pay for CO2 left Australian taxpayers to “pick up the tab” through the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund.\n“This is real pollution entering the atmosphere – pollution we can’t bring back, pollution that is heating the planet,” he said. “Ultimately, everyone will pay for this, whether it’s through losing a home to unseasonal bushfires, through food shortages as a result of worse droughts, or through not having coral reefs to appreciate.”\nThe safeguard mechanism was announced by the then environment minister Greg Hunt in 2015. He said it would put “a limit on the emissions that individual firms can have” to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by increases “above business-as-usual levels” elsewhere.\nIn practice, companies have regularly applied for and been granted higher limits, or baselines. It has prompted some business representatives and climate campaigners to question the point of the scheme.\nThe data released last week shows industrial emissions covered by the mechanism rose 5.6m tonnes, a 4% jump on the previous year. Some of the increase was from companies that lifted their emissions while staying within their limit.\nA spokesman for the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said all emitters met their obligations under the scheme last year.\nRising industrial pollution means national emissions have dipped only slightly, according to the most recent greenhouse accounts, despite reductions from electricity and drought-affected agriculture.\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nThe data covers a period well before the coronavirus pandemic forced a significant economic shutdown. It is expected emissions will fall this year, though analysts have warned they are likely to return to previous levels once the threat from the virus has passed unless policies change.\nThe data shows the biggest emitters last year were LNG projects: Chevron’s Gorgon development in the Pilbara, Woodside’s North West Shelf project and Inpex’s Ichthys development.\nIn addition to companies emitting at levels above previous baselines, the data shows a growing number of companies have been granted what is known as a multiyear monitoring period, under which emissions limits are no longer annual, but spread over a number of years. The number of facilities with these multiyear limits increased from 17 to 31.\nMcFadzean said it was effectively another way for companies to avoid paying for emitting too much in a given year. “In many cases they are not reducing their emissions in subsequent years, but instead are allowed to recalculate their baselines and pollute more,” he said.\nThe safeguard mechanism sets a baseline for industrial facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes each year. When the scheme began, baselines were based on either a facility’s highest emissions level over the previous five years or an independent forecast of future pollution.\nUnder changes introduced this year, all facilities are moving to limits based not on total emissions, but on emissions intensity – how much they emit per unit of production. It means that companies that lift production will be able to release more CO2 without risking a penalty.\nIt could also allow a government to require companies to reduce emissions intensity over time to drive a shift to cleaner practice without affecting production levels. Labor indicated it would have done this, without releasing much detail, if it won last year’s election.\nIn 2015, Hunt said the safeguard would be used to cut emissions by 200m tonnes over the decade to 2030, but the government later shelved that estimate. The policy was not included among policies that the government said would help it meet Australia’s commitments under the Paris climate agreement.\nIn February, Taylor said the safeguard mechanism was “designed to support growth while encouraging businesses to lower their emissions intensity”.\nThe Carbon Market Institute, representing businesses focused on climate action, has called for the safeguard mechanism and emissions reduction fund to be reformed as part of a post-virus economic repair that also focuses on “land and climate repair”.\nThe institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said the emissions reduction fund would need to be less dependent on taxpayer’s money and increasingly driven by business, and baselines under the safeguard should be strengthened to cut pollution over time.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Armed fighters had just seized her house in Aleppo and her family were on the run.\nKumari was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, preparing to present a conference. She immediately began organising a sprint back to Syria. Hidden in her sister’s house was a small but very valuable bundle that she was prepared to risk her life to recover.\nKumari is a plant virologist. Her work focuses on a quiet yet devastating development crisis. Climate-fuelled virus epidemics affecting fava beans, lentils and chickpeas are spreading from Syria to Ethiopia, gradually destroying the livelihoods of low-income populations. Known as “poor man’s meat”, these pulses are vital for both income generation and food security in many parts of the world.\nFinding a cure was urgent, Kumari explains. Hopeless farmers were seeing increasing levels of infected crops turning yellow and black. The cause? “Climate change provides aphids with the right temperatures to breed exponentially and spread the epidemics,” she says.\nFor 10 years, Kumari worked to find a solution. Finally, she discovered a bean variety naturally resistant to one of the viruses: the fava bean necrotic yellow virus (FBNYV). “When I found those resistant seeds, I felt there was something important in them,” says Kumari from her lab in Lebanon where she now works. Only the fighting in Syria had moved. “I had left them at my sister’s in central Aleppo to protect them from the fighting,” she says.\nThey wanted to buy our product and then sell it to the farmers, but we refused\nDr Safaa Kumari, plant virologist\nDetermined not to let a war get in the way of her work “for the world’s poor”, Kumari felt it her duty to rescue the seeds in Aleppo. “I was thinking: how am I going to get those seeds out of Syria?\n“I had to go through Damascus, and then drive all the way to Aleppo. There was fighting and bombings everywhere.” After two days’ driving along dangerous roads, seeds in hand, Kumari made it to Lebanon, where she now works as a researcher at Icarda (International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas) in the Bekaa valley, close to the Syrian border. Hassan Machlab, Icarda’s country manager says: “Many of the Syrian scientists we welcomed here have suffered. It is tough.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBut bringing the seeds to safety was only the beginning. Kumari needed to turn them into a sustainable solution.\nAdvertisement\nAs crop production collapsed in the region, producers started to rely heavily on insecticides. “Most farmers go to the field and spray it without safety material – masks and appropriate jacket,” she says. “Some are dying, others are getting sick or developing pregnancy issues.”\nAt first, the sample failed. “So we crossed them with another variety that had a better yield and obtained something that is both resistant and productive,” says Kumari. “When we release it, it will be environment-friendly and provide farmers with a good yield, more cheaply and without insecticide.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSeed samples in the laboratory.\nKumari now plans to distribute her super-seeds free to farmers. She has already turned down an offer from a large company for the virus detection technology.\n“They wanted to buy our product and then sell it to the farmers, but we refused,” says Kumari. “Ours is free. It’s our responsibility to provide our solutions to people everywhere,” she says.\nBut, as for many Syrian refugees, the war is never far from her thoughts, “Something she won’t tell you is that it wasn’t easy for her,” says Machlab. “She was working on all this and she didn’t have a clear mind as her family were in Aleppo and her house was destroyed.”\nScientists in Israel grow date plants from 2,000-year-old seeds\nRead more\nKumari adds: “Last week I saw my family in Turkey. I have five sisters and three brothers, scattered in Germany, Turkey, Syria. The last time we met was in Aleppo in 2012. When I came back someone told me ‘Safaa, you’re looking great today!’ Of course, I had just spent time with my family again!” she says, laughing.\nBut she adds: “It’s not easy for me, it’s not easy for a woman to work on agriculture (research). It’s not easy, but it’s OK.\nAdvertisement\n“When I’m working, I’m not thinking I am a Syrian or a woman though.

At the same time, it feels as if we’ve walked into an old recurring dream. In a way, we have. We’ve seen it before, on TV and in blockbusters. We knew roughly what it would be like, and somehow this makes the encounter not less strange, but more so.\n‘We can’t go back to normal’: how will coronavirus change the world? – podcast\nEvery day brings news of developments that, as recently as February, would have felt impossible – the work of years, not mere days. We refresh the news not because of a civic sense that following the news is important, but because so much may have happened since the last refresh. These developments are coming so fast that it’s hard to remember just how radical they are.\nCast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be out of work. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history. In certain places, landlords will not be collecting rent, or banks collecting mortgage payments, and the homeless will be allowed to stay in hotels free of charge. Experiments will be underway in the direct government provision of basic income. Large swathes of the world will be collaborating – with various degrees of coercion and nudging – on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing?\nIt’s not just the size and speed of what is happening that’s dizzying. It’s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global flu epidemic of 1918 helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.\nBut crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military’s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is being slowed by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was resolved in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nBecause crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work – what we might call the field of “crisis studies” – charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear.\nIn such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-empty flights for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been reports of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. Prisoners in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.\nBut disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it’s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we’re entering become clear.\nT\nhe pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters – and especially pandemics – know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders – and assaulted, banished and killed “undesirable” community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of “xenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic”: they range from taunts to outright assault.\nAdvertisement\n“In a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,” says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote a book about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. “In a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies – test kits, masks, respirators – not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it’s all one battle. But it’s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.”\nIn the US, President Trump has tried hard to brand the new coronavirus as inherently “Chinese”, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have claimed or implied that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the conspiracy theory that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, recently announced: “We are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.”\nWhen you’re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it’s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn’t used. “In the course of a few days,” Zuboff says, “the concern shifted from ‘How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights’ to ‘How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?’”\nAdvertisement\nFor governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones’ built-in speakers broadcast scoldings from police. Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium are all using data – anonymised, for now – from major telecommunications companies to track people’s movement. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individual’s phone records. South Korea sends texts to the public identifying potentially infected individuals and sharing information about where they’ve been.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nIllustration: Nathalie Lees/The Guardian\nNot all surveillance is inherently malign, and new tech tools very well might end up playing a role in fighting the virus, but Zuboff worries that these emergency measures will become permanent, so enmeshed in daily life that we forget their original purpose. Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. “People have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they’re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,” says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. “Once a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.”\nAdvertisement\nIn the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK’s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the authority – in place for the next two years – to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed a request with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. “Those of us who follow the police know how this goes,” said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. “These powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time – and then very quickly they’re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.”\nIn a 2008 report on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency – resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 – for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: “People, rather than the disease, become the enemy.”\nPlay Video\nCoronavirus: 'each and every individual matters', says WHO director – video\nT\nhere’s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat – with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited – Covid-19 might open the door to political progress.\nAdvertisement\n“I think we’re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,” said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today’s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. “Ideas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There’s room for change that there wasn’t beforehand. It’s an opening.”\nThe argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state does have – the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra recently wrote: “It has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.”\nFor years, in mainstream politics the conventional line – on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing – has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are “marketplace” solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like “the public good” but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days – even going so far as to write cheques directly to citizens – and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.\nFrom this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus – and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.\nIn her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit used case studies of disasters – including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina – to argue that emergencies aren’t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster – but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit’s telling, “official” disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.\nGet the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\nAdvertisement\nSometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence – other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein’s view, there is always Disaster 1 – the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump – and Disaster 2 – the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)\nUnlike Solnit’s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn’t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably – or “naturally” – happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.\nIn 2008, days after Barack Obama’s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” Today’s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?\nFor anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they’re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be “in it together” – as always, the poor are hit worse – but there is more truth to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.\nIn this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.\n“More people are in a position to connect the dots,” Klein said. “It has to do with people’s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.”\nT\nhat screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming – that they know is already here – and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter’s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.\n“We’ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. “What is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode – when they fundamentally accept that there’s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it’s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can’t think we’re going to go ‘back to normal’, because things weren’t normal.”\nThe analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.\nBut it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke used pollution data from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online – stories of sweet-smelling breezes, expanded bike lanes and birdsong returning to neighbourhoods – in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.\nAdvertisement\nAlongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein’s “shock doctrine” framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that, in recognition of the pandemic’s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China’s environmental ministry has started waiving inspections that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a public relations blitz on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too – only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.\nSalamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. “I’m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I’m talking about people calling each other up and saying: ‘How are you doing? Are you scared? I’m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.’ And that’s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we’re terrified about.” Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. “It’s good that we’re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,” she said. “But unless we also do it for climate … ” She didn’t finish the sentence.\nW\nhat kind of actions would it take for the optimists’ vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. “The left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,” he told me. “And it wasn’t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.” How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?\n“The political outcome of the epidemic,” said Mike Davis, “will, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.” One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. “The biggest risk for all of us,” said Klein, “is going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.”\nAdvertisement\nDavis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn’t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about “SUPPORT THE NURSES’ UNION” or “DEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE”.\nSolnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn’t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour’s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak wave of strikes roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.\n'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine\nRead more\nWhat happens next might depend on the optimists’ ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. “We don’t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,” wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. “We cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.”\nThe world feels awfully strange right now, but not because – or not just because – it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it. It feels strange because the past few weeks have exposed the fact that the biggest things can always change, at any minute. This simple truth, both destabilising and liberating, is easy to forget. We’re not watching a movie: we’re writing one, together, until the end.\n• This article was amended on 31 March. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Mike Davis lives in Hawaii.

This summer’s Antarctic weather, as elsewhere in the world, was unprecedented in the observed record.\nOur research, published today in Global Change Biology, describes the recent heatwave in Antarctica. Beginning in late spring east of the Antarctic Peninsula, it circumnavigated the continent over the next four months. Some of our team spent the summer in Antarctica observing these temperatures and the effect on natural systems, witnessing the heatwave first hand.\nAntarctica may be isolated from the rest of the continents by the Southern Ocean, but has worldwide impacts. It drives the global ocean conveyor belt, a constant system of deep-ocean circulation which transfers oceanic heat around the planet, and its melting ice sheet adds to global sea level rise.\nAntarctica represents the simple, extreme end of conditions for life. It can be seen as a “canary in the mine”, demonstrating patterns of change we can expect to see elsewhere.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA satellite image showing melting on the ice cap of Eagle Island, Antarctica, on 13 February. Photograph: NASA Earth Observatory\nA heatwave in the coldest place on Earth\nMost of Antarctica is ice-covered, but there are small ice-free oases, predominantly on the coast. Collectively 0.44% of the continent, these unique areas are important biodiversity hotspots for penguins and other seabirds, mosses, lichens, lakes, ponds and associated invertebrates.\nThis summer, Casey Research Station, in the Windmill Islands oasis, experienced its first recorded heatwave. For three days, minimum temperatures exceeded zero and daily maximums were all above 7.5C. On 24 January, its highest maximum of 9.2C was recorded, almost 7C above Casey’s 30-year mean for the month.\nThe arrival of warm, moist air during this weather event brought rain to Davis Research Station in the normally frigid, ice-free desert of the Vestfold Hills. The warm conditions triggered extensive meltwater pools and surface streams on local glaciers. These, together with melting snowbanks, contributed to high-flowing rivers and flooding lakes.\nBy February, most heat was concentrated in the Antarctic Peninsula at the northernmost part of the continent. A new Antarctic maximum temperature of 18.4C was recorded on 6 February at Argentina’s Esperanza research station on the peninsula – almost 1C above the previous record. Three days later this was eclipsed when 20.75C was reported at Argentina’s Marambio station, on Seymour Island east of the peninsula.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe difference between mean surface air temperatures for January 2020 from the January average over the preceding 40 years. Photograph: Andrew Klekociuk/The Conversation\nWhat caused the heatwave?\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe pace of warming from global climate change has been generally slower in East Antarctica compared with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. This is in part due to the ozone hole, which has occurred in spring over Antarctica since the late 1970s.\nThe hole has tended to strengthen jet stream winds over the Southern Ocean, promoting a generally more “positive” state of the Southern Annular Mode in summer. This means the Southern Ocean’s westerly wind belt has tended to stay close to Antarctica at that time of year creating a seasonal “shield”, reducing the transfer of warm air from the Earth’s temperate regions to Antarctica.\nBut during the spring of 2019 a strong warming of the stratosphere over Antarctica significantly reduced the size of the ozone hole. This helped to support a more “negative” state of the Southern Annular Mode and weakened the shield.\nOther factors in late 2019 may have also helped to warm Antarctica. The Indian Ocean Dipole was in a strong “positive” state due to a late retreat of the Indian monsoon. This meant that water in the western Indian Ocean was warmer than normal. Air rising from this and other warm ocean patches in the Pacific Ocean provided energy sources that altered the path of weather systems and helped to disturb and warm the stratosphere.\nIs a warming Antarctica good or bad?\nLocalised flooding appeared to benefit some of Vestfold Hills’ moss banks that were previously very drought-stressed. Prior to the flood event, most mosses were grey and moribund, but a month later many moss shoots were green.\nGiven the generally cold conditions of Antarctica, the warmth may have benefited the flora (mosses, lichens and two vascular plants) and microbes and invertebrates, but only where liquid water formed. Areas in the Vestfold Hills away from the flooding became more drought-stressed over the summer.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nMoss at Mossel Lake, Vestfold Hills, photographed before the heatwave events (13 Dec 2019, left) and after snowmelt (22 January 2020, right). Some mosses responded to the additional water by greening up very quickly. Photograph: Australian Antarctic Division/Dana M Bergstrom\nAdvertisement\nHigh temperatures may have caused heat stress in some organisms. Antarctic mosses and lichens are often dark in colour, allowing sunlight to be absorbed to create warm microclimates. This is a great strategy when temperatures are just above freezing, but heat stress can occur once 10C is exceeded.\nOn King George Island, near the Antarctic Peninsula, our measurements showed that in January 2019 moss surface temperatures exceeded 14C for only 3% of the time, but in 2020 this increased fourfold (to 12% of the time).\nBased on our experience from previous anomalous hot Antarctic summers, we can expect many biological impacts, positive and negative, in coming years. The most recent event highlights the connectedness of our climate systems: from the surface to the stratosphere, and from the monsoon tropics to the southernmost continent.\nUnder climate change, extreme events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, and Antarctica is not immune.\nDana M Bergstrom is principal research scientist at the Antarctic Division and a visiting scholar at the University of Wollongong; Andrew Klekociuk is an adjunct senior lecturer at the University of Tasmania; Diana King is a research officer at the University of Wollongong; and Sharon Robinson is professor at the University of Wollongong.\nThis article was first published by the Conversation.

Now a group of public health experts says similar warnings should appear on high-carbon products, from airline tickets and energy bills to petrol pumps, to show consumers the health impacts of the climate crisis.\nWarning labels would be a cheap but potentially highly effective intervention that would make consumers aware of the impact of their purchases on climate breakdown, according to the experts.\n“Warning labels connect the abstract threat of the climate emergency with the use of fossil fuels in the here and now, drawing attention to the true cost of fossil fuels pictorially or quantitatively,” they write in the British Medical Journal. “They sensitise people to the consequences of their actions, representing nudges designed to encourage users to choose alternatives to fossil fuels, thus increasing demand for zero-carbon renewable energy.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA Canadian anti-smoking warning. Images and messages have grown starker in recent years. Photograph: European Parliament/PA\nIn many countries smoking labels have grown more graphic in recent years, with pictures of diseased lungs, children breathing smoke and blunt messages covering most of the packaging, in place of the anodyne “smoking can damage your health” warnings of the past.\nHigh-carbon health labels could be similarly graphic, especially if they highlighted the damage to health from air pollution caused by fossil fuels, such as the exhaust gases from diesel vehicles. They could include pictures of damaged lungs, or highlight severe weather such as flooding, or show the bodies of people who have died because of heatwaves, said Mike Gill, a former regional director of public health for south-east England, and a co-author of the letter.\nWe label fridges to show their environmental impact – why not food?\nJoseph Poore\nRead more\nIn some countries, messages could include the increased spread of dengue fever and malaria driven by global heating, while there should also be scope to warn about the effects of environmental degradation caused by climate breakdown, and the harmful effects on water and food supplies, he added.\n“The messages, including their pictorial element, should be stark and arresting, and they should relate directly to those effects known directly to affect health, such as air pollution causing heart disease and asthma,” he told the Guardian. “The immediate task will be to get some really arresting designs produced, such as we already have for cigarette packet warnings.”\nLabels warning of the damage to health would make more of an impression on people than messages focusing on the impact on the environment, wrote the experts, who included four professors of environmental health in the UK, US and India.\nSmoking labels have been accompanied by stricter bans on advertising, and the authors of the BMJ article want to see similar restrictions on advertising by fossil fuel companies, including better policing of misleading claims about investments in renewable energy that represent a minority of a fossil fuel company’s portfolio.\nPutting labels on high-carbon goods and services would require government intervention, and the authors hope that the UK could lead the way as hosts of the crunch UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for Glasgow this November.\nThe experts argue that the warnings could be swiftly adopted so as to “reduce the risk of a rapid rebound in greenhouse gas emissions as the economy expands” after the coronavirus crisis.\nGreen campaigners have also made similar suggestions on putting warning labels on high-carbon goods and services. Previous attempts to put labels on goods that showed the amount of carbon that went into their production petered out, however, as consumers found them hard to understand.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

However, ShareAction is calling on investors to back both resolutions, to ensure the bank actually pulls its services from the largest carbon emitters, rather than just offsetting them with alternative investments or services to other sectors.\nBarclays has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years and is the seventh largest globally, according to a recent report by the Rainforest Action Network. The bank has provided more than $118bn (£95.2bn) worth of financial services to carbon-intensive companies and projects since the Paris agreement was signed in 2016 and was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas last year.\nAdvertisement\nNatasha Landell-Mills, the head of stewardship at the asset manager Sarasin & Partners, a co-filer of ShareAction’s resolution, said: “The message is powerful: continuing to finance activities that undermine planet stability is not in anyone’s interests – and certainly not shareholders. This is groundbreaking and the board deserves to be commended. Other banks should follow suit.\n“What matters now is that the board sets robust nearer-term targets that leave no doubt about its determination to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. Shareholders should underline their support for this by supporting not just Barclays’ resolution but also the shareholder-initiated resolution at Barclays’ forthcoming AGM.”\nBarclays is expected to consult with groups including ShareAction before it releases detailed targets by the end of the year and will release its first set of reports on its progress in 2021.\nThe lender had come under mounting pressure in recent months after a number of high-profile investors publicly backed the ShareAction vote. The resolution – which was filed by a group of investment and pension funds managing more than £130bn of assets – gained the support of the top 25 shareholder Jupiter Asset Management, Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi, the Church of England’s investment arm and Nest – the largest UK pension fund by members.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nIn an interim update to its climate policy, Barclays said it would restrict financing for companies that benefit from thermal coal activities but would continue funding some companies involved in controversial tar sands projects in Canada that aim to cut their emissions. Barclays will no longer support new Arctic drilling and will not finance fracking in the UK or Europe but will consider other global projects.\nGreenpeace UK’s senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, criticised the policy, which he said contradicted Barclays climate announcements. “The whole thing stinks of hypocrisy. It’s nothing but an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of shareholders, who rightly want the bank to end its contribution to catastrophic climate breakdown.\n“Barclays remains Europe’s largest financier of these planet-heating industries and refuses to face up to the reality of the climate emergency and their role in fuelling it. Until it realises that getting to net zero means ambitious action to phase out support for all fossil fuels, this newly proposed resolution is absolutely meaningless.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent\nWas this helpful?\nJapan’s carbon targets – known as its nationally determined contribution (NDC) in the UN jargon – as announced on Monday morning are almost unchanged from its commitments made in 2015 towards the Paris accord, however.\nThe country’s target of a 26% reduction in emissions by 2030, based on 2013 levels, is rated as “highly insufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker analysis, meaning that if all targets were at this level, temperature rises would exceed 3C.\nThe country, the world’s fifth biggest emitter and third biggest economy, is one of the only developed countries still building new coal-fired power stations, although there are signs it may hold back.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nJapan’s energy systems were thrown into turmoil by the accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, after which the country shut its many nuclear reactors. The country’s politics have also been affected by intensified competition from neighbouring China, which overtook Japan as the world’s second largest economy in 2010.\nOnce a strong proponent of climate action – and proud of the 1997 Kyoto protocol signed under its auspices – Japan in recent years has appeared lukewarm in its commitments at a succession of UN meetings, before and since the landmark Paris conference of 2015.\nCampaigners fear the coronavirus pandemic will be seen by some countries as a way to weaken their commitment to the Paris accord and present less stringent targets instead of the strong cuts needed.\n“Japan should not slow down climate actions even amid the Covid-19 global fights, and must revisit and strengthen this plan swiftly in order to be in line with the Paris agreement,” said Kimiko Hirata, the international director of the Kiko Network, a climate group in Japan.\nShe added that the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared content “to settle for a low target and policies to continue to fund coal, which are firmly taking us down the path to economic and environmental ruin”.\nKat Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, said of the latest Japanese plan: “The fact they are smuggling it out during a global pandemic, when it will avoid the scrutiny it deserves, is shameful.”\nLaurence Tubiana,the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and the French architect of the Paris agreement, called Japan’s move disappointing and contrasted it with those of economic rivals the EU, UK, China and South Korea, which she said were moving to a low-carbon economy.\n“At one of the most challenging times of recent memory, we need bolder, mutually reinforcing plans that protect our societies from the global risks we all face,” Tubiana said.\nEnvironmental regulations and climate commitments have come under attack in the context of the coronavirus crisis. Under Donald Trump’s administration in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back key regulations including car efficiency standards. In the EU, carmakers wrote to the European commission last week to demand a loosening of requirements on them to cut carbon.\nThere is still scope for Japan to revise its targets. Other countries have yet to submit their detailed NDCs, but several – including the UK and the EU, and more than 70 smaller economies – made public their intention to reach net zero carbon by 2050, at last year’s UN climate talks in Madrid.\nThis year’s talks, called Cop 26, are still officially scheduled to be held in Glasgow this November, although there has been pressure from some quarters to announce a postponement.\nMany notable figures, including the leading climate economist Lord Stern, and former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, have spoken out against postponement at this stage. They fear a delay would mean countries slowing their work on emissions cuts.\nUnder the plans that national governments submitted to the UN under the Paris agreement, the world would reach more than 3C of warming according to estimates – a figure scientists say would be disastrous in terms of increases in extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises.\nNew plans are urgently needed, campaigners say, as emissions have risen globally by 4% since the Paris agreement was signed.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

You start to see ecosystems fall apart and then struggle to recover before the next major disturbance.”\nThe Australia’s Environment report scored environmental conditions across seven indicators – inundation, streamflow, vegetation growth, leaf area, soil protection, tree cover and the number of hot days.\nAcross all years analysed, 2005 was the next worst year, impacted by the millennium drought. The year 2010 was the best; it was also one of Australia’s wettest on record.\nAdvertisement\nVan Dijk said the cause of the impacts for 2019 were global heating as well as natural variability in Australia’s climate. The number of days above 35C was 36% higher than the previous 19 years.\nThe population had continued to grow and the country’s greenhouse gas emissions had remained high, the report said.\nGreenhouse gas emissions per person were 11% below the 2000-18 average, but remained among the highest in the world because of high energy use per person and the burning of coal for electricity.\nFindings were underpinned by about 1m gigabytes of data, including satellite data that only became available from 2000, as well as field data and on-the-ground surveys.\nReviewing biodiversity impacts, the report highlighted the number of spectacled flying foxes – one of many species vulnerable to heat stress – had dropped to 47,000 from an average of 100,000 before 2016.\nCoronavirus: 'Nature is sending us a message’, says UN environment chief\nRead more\nThe numbers of threatened species had risen by 36% since 2000, the report said.\nRiver flows were 43% below the 2000-18 average, causing water storages to drop and mass fish deaths in the Murray-Darling Basin, and wetland environments had also seen record-low inundation.\nRiver flows were above average around the coast of northern Queensland, around Karratha in Western Australia and at Strahan in Tasmania’s west.\nThe protection of soils by vegetation and moisture was “extremely poor”, causing dust storms. The average soil moisture was also lowest since at least 2000 and farming productivity had been hit.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, which has just experienced its third mass bleaching event in five years, had escaped bleaching in 2019 but its condition remained poor.\nWorld heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, the Blue Mountains, alpine regions, eastern Gippsland and Kangaroo Island had all been badly hit by bushfires.\nA co-author of the report, Dr Marta Yebra, said: “Our data clearly shows that the combination of dry forests and hot weather made for an especially explosive mixture.”\nAdvertisement\nAll the findings and data from the report, now in its fifth year, can be viewed on a website and interactive map.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The Granite City is still one week away from a market collapse even deeper than the 2016 price crash.\n“This is a real worry so soon after the last downturn,” one taxi driver says. “It doesn’t take long for people to lose their jobs if the oil price is under $35 [£28] a barrel. Within three or four months of low oil prices contract workers can be out of work. It’s always quicker than you’d think.”\nA week later oil is trading at about $25 a barrel, wiping billions from the market value of UK oil companies, and an industry report warns that the North Sea oil and gas industry is in a “paper-thin” position. Oil companies are expected to axe their spending plans to weather the latest market rout, which threatens to halve the revenue from the barrels of oil they produce this year.\n“During the last oil price crash Aberdeen was not ready at all,” says one North Sea veteran. “The city itself completely changed within the space of a few months. Around 150,000 people in the UK lost their jobs, and Aberdeen bore the brunt.”\nHe asks not to be named because after more than 20 years working in the North Sea oil and gas industry he is struggling to find work. In recent days a verbal job offer from one North Sea firm was rescinded and an interview with another cancelled. Employers have brought in hiring freezes across the city and recruiters have scrapped their meeting schedules for the next few weeks.\nThis disquiet is still fresh in the city’s collective memory. The last oil market downturn was deeper and longer than any oil market rout in history, lasting from late 2014 to its nadir at $28 a barrel in the first weeks of 2016. It was punctuated by about 150 North Sea job losses a day and a string of bankruptcies. At its depths property prices in Aberdeen plummeted and mortgage arrears spiralled to double the national level.\n“The last downturn was a tough one for the city,” says Derek Leith, a senior partner at EY’s Aberdeen office. “But what it meant was that Aberdeen began to think very seriously about the fact that eventually the era of oil and gas will come to an end and the city needs to be famous for doing something else.\n“There’s been a lot of effort to change the trajectory to make Aberdeen a centre for energy, rather than of oil and gas. The idea is to use the city’s existing skills and pivot towards renewables and other clean energy sources,” he says.\nAs the UK moves towards a net-zero carbon future many have questioned whether there can still be a place for the UK’s ageing oil industry. Now, a green future might be Aberdeen’s best bet for a long-term future.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“If you were to ask a dyed-in-the-wool Aberdonian who has worked in the oil industry for the last 20, 30 years whether they are interested in climate action they would probably only go along with it as long as it didn’t impact their livelihoods,” the North Sea veteran says. “These same people are realising that renewables might just save them.”\nSir Ian Wood is one such convert. During the North Sea’s boom years in the 1970s and 80s the billionaire oil tycoon used the UK’s lead in offshore oil and gas to transform his modest family firm, Wood Group, into one of the world’s largest oil engineering companies. Today, he believes the city that ignited the world’s dependence on fossil fuels believes it may hold the answer to tackling its consequences.\nWood set up Opportunity North East as oil prices tumbled in 2015. His threefold plan to rebalance the region’s economy recasts the offshore heritage and engineering legacy of the north-east of Scotland as a vital advantage in building a greener economy.\nFirst, accelerate the offshore wind boom, including a new generation of floating wind farms. Next, use this abundant clean energy to siphon off the carbon from hydrocarbon gas, in a process known as steam methane reforming, to produce clean-burning hydrogen for transport fuels and industry. Finally, store the leftover carbon “waste” from this process beneath the seabed to prevent it contributing to rising global temperatures.\n“This all sounds very glib,” Wood says. “It will take, in my opinion, 10 to 15 years to get this right. Once we have it, we will be able to sequester quite a lot of carbon emissions.”\nGetting it right would also secure a route to market for North Sea gas and a place for Aberdeen at the centre of the UK’s hydrogen economy. The city has already taken steps to lay claim to a green future, including the establishment of the Net Zero Solution Centre, a hub of green tech innovation within the Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), which could one day export low-carbon energy solutions globally.\nColette Cohen, the chief executive of the OGTC, says leading oil companies are beginning to take meaningful steps towards complying with the UK’s legally binding climate targets, but the oil price collapse has raised doubts.\n“When we were first set up three years ago the industry was still struggling against the last oil market downturn,” she says. “When we were talking about what their carbon footprint would look like in the next decade, companies were saying: ‘I may not exist then, it’s really financially challenging right now.’”\nIn the last year, there has been a palpable shift within the industry, she says, but the latest market crash “has to be a concern” for future green investments. “Everything around net zero costs money. If oil companies are backed into survival mode their ability to spend any spare cash on future-proofing their operations becomes more difficult.”\nLeith believes the latest crash may be enough to convince companies that investing in clean energy alternatives and “survival mode” are not mutually exclusive.\n“There are always some who would prefer to batten down the hatches and hope for an upturn in oil prices so that they can go back to what they regard as normal. If anyone is still under that misconception then the last few weeks should have put that to bed,” he says.\n• This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly referred to an “electrolyser machine” as removing carbon from hydrocarbon gas; this is actually done through a process called steam methane reforming.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Precisely, and this is why a similar approach is needed to confront the climate emergency – and why rightwing governments will fail to do so unless they adopt a leftwing approach that does not prioritise market and profit and instead sees the merits of massive state intervention. And the coronavirus crisis rather pointedly undermines Philip Cerny’s remark that the nation state cannot have a key role in this (“My solution to the climate crisis”, Letters). What we are learning now is the importance, yes, of individual responsibility and local initiatives but also of decisive governmental action to enforce the suspension of business as usual, and of international cooperation. The only other essential element is a recognition that the climate emergency is just as pressing and very much more of a mortal threat than even the current pandemic.\nJem Whiteley\nOxford\nI read with interest the interview with Professor Tim Lang with its important messages and mention of Covid-19 (“Why our food supply system doesn’t work”, Focus). I too am concerned about the UK’s food supply chains, given it imports at least half of its food. If imports of food, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, decline because countries like Spain and Italy are going to struggle to feed themselves because of this pandemic, this would affect the diet of the UK’s population, particularly the elderly, young and disadvantaged. It would be reassuring to know what the UK government’s contingency plans are.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nFurthermore, given the likely longer-term nature of the pandemic, we should also instigate the free distribution of these foods and vitamins for the elderly in our care homes and similar institutions throughout the UK, as a matter of urgency. Vulnerable elderly people have been told to self-isolate, possibly for many months, which will reduce their exposure to sunshine, which is essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin D.\nDr Laurence Harbige\nLondon E4\nYour Sport section detailed two sums of £50,000 being donated by each of Manchester’s richest clubs, United and City, to their local food bank (“United and City donate combined £100,000 to Manchester food banks”). An act to be applauded. However, you omitted to mention that Stockport County, playing in the league’s fifth tier, and with a somewhat lower financial income, has donated the sum of £75,000 to its local NHS foundation trust charitable fund to help support the staff looking after local people in these troubled times. Perhaps a mention of this fact might be worthy of consideration.\nDave Johnson\nHayfield, High Peak\nDerbyshire\nGood move, BBC\nAdvertisement\nI gave up watching Question Time (“BBC’s Question Time accused of giving platform to far right”, last week) several years ago, when questions and comments from the audience persistently ran the full gamut from neo-Nazism to proactive idiocy, laced with an occasional smattering of common sense and decency. While audience applause would often imply a more balanced composition, spoken emphasis was consistently on the right, and had a nasty ring to it. Last week’s QT was great – I found politicians I thought I loathed rather nuanced and interesting, the discussion became constructive and illuminating, and we could at last see why the BBC chose Fiona Bruce. Good move, BBC! Fiona, Keep it up!\nMarcia Saunders\nLondon N10\nKeep challenging, Lucy\nI’m writing with regard to the article about University Challenge by Lucy Clarke from Jesus College, Oxford (“I loved appearing on University Challenge. Then I went on Twitter…”, Viewpoint). It saddens me greatly that, since her appearance, Lucy has received such vile and ignorant comments on social media. I would like to assure Lucy that there are many of us men out there who do not judge the contestants (of whatever gender) by their appearance, nor indeed by the sounds of their voices. I do take note of who is, and who is not, answering questions, but this is certainly not gender-related; it is simply a reflection of the comparative ability of contestants. I advise Lucy to ignore puerile and prejudicial comments, because they are just not worth your time and energy. They are written by people who probably can’t even operate a Biro, never mind answer a question on University Challenge.\nJon Gruffydd\nCrughywel\nPowys\nDisastrous Lib Dems\nBarbara Ellen defends the Liberals’ claims during their disastrous 2019 election campaign as a tactic to “distance the Liberals from Labour” in Tory seats (“A shout-out to the Lib Dems, who at least were an option”, Comment). What a pity that the rest of us can’t distance ourselves from the consequences of the 2010-15 rundown of the NHS and social care which Liberals voted for under Nick Clegg, or the Liberals’ 2015 endorsement of absurd Tory claims that it was Labour’s investment in public services including the NHS – not the recklessness of the bankers – which was the cause of the global banking crisis, thereby legitimising the continued Tory rundown of the NHS in 2015-20.\nChristopher Clayton\nWaverton, Chester\nRight trees in the right places\nYour article, “Fewer oaks, more conifers: Britain’s forests must change to meet climate targets” (News), is a prime example of not seeing the wood for the trees. Yes, there are trade-offs between the types of woodland we create: exotic conifers suck carbon out of the atmosphere faster, whilst native broadleaved species grow more slowly but tend to support more species of wildlife. But endless infighting between foresters and conservationists risks obscuring the bigger picture.\nAdvertisement\nWe face a dual ecological crisis – the climate emergency and the breakdown of nature. Friends of the Earth’s analysis shows we easily have enough land to double UK tree cover. By growing the right trees in the right place, we can help lock up millions of tonnes of carbon and create much more space for wildlife. To achieve this we need a diverse group of approaches, including rewilded woods, sensitively planted commercial forests, bigger hedgerows, and agroforestry on farms. Rather than squabble over the details, let’s collaborate to make this broader vision a reality.\nGuy Shrubsole, Friends of the Earth\nLondon SW9\nWhat goes up…\nDavid Head asserts that science and technology have made little impact on the metaphors that we use in everyday life (“Metaphorically speaking”, Letters). Really? What about all those lightbulb moments and quantum leaps, the occasions when we are railroaded into a decision, things that disappear into black holes, governments that lack the bandwidth to deal with more than one issue? But perhaps scientific and technological metaphor is now so much part of our DNA that we are hardwired not to notice it.\nElizabeth Swinbank\nYork\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

What the government was pursuing was a worse society – that may not have been the objective, but it was what came out.”\nBut what had happened in response to coronavirus revealed a new way of operating for governments. “With Covid-19, everything [on austerity] went out of the window. It turns out austerity was a choice,” he said. “The government can spend anything [in the context of the coronavirus crisis], and they have socialised the economy.”\nCoronavirus mapped: which countries have the most cases and deaths?\nRead more\nThe urgency with which the government had acted showed that the response to an emergency could be swift and decisive, he said. But the climate crisis has been viewed as a “slow-burn” issue and had not elicited such a response. “Coronavirus exposes that we can do things differently,” Marmot said. “We must not go back to the status quo ante.”\nMarmot, who led the Marmot review of life expectancy, which earlier this year was found to have stalled for the first time in a century after the austerity policies of the last decade, urged ministers in the UK and other countries to put health equity “at the heart of all policymaking”, as it would lead to better outcomes across a range of issues. “It would lead to better environmental policy, it would lead to better social policy, it would lead to better healthcare policy and better politics.”\nSir David King, who was chief scientific adviser from 2000 to 2008, a period that included the foot-and-mouth epidemic that devastated farming in 2001, said governments were quick to forget about dangers in their quest to save money and must learn lessons from coronavirus.\nHe pointed to his own work on flood defences while chief scientific adviser. After serious floods in the early 2000s and work by climate scientists showing that flooding would become more frequent across the UK, he pushed for more spending on defences and a new national plan.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFloodwater surrounds houses and residential properties in Snaith. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\nBut in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, he said, austerity measures led to many flood defence projects being shelved and warnings ignored. The result was that over the following decade flooding got worse, as scientists had predicted, but many more people suffered and had their homes and livelihoods put at risk because resources were withdrawn.\nKing also said the government had been warned in 2016 of the dangers of a viral pandemic and should have been better prepared. “In 2016, a report indicated that our hospitals would not be ready for an epidemic of this kind. But that report has not been made public.”\nThe climate emergency represented a real risk but was being treated too lightly, he warned. “I think the climate emergency is much more serious than people think.”\nKing served as special representative for climate change to the government after leaving his post as chief scientific adviser, and was one of the experts who pushed for the Paris agreement in 2015. He warned that the Paris agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C or 2C was probably too weak, however, to save the world from the impacts of climate breakdown. “We need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,” he warned.\nHe pointed to the economic recovery plans after the second world war, and said that after the coronavirus crisis has passed, governments should consider similar plans to redevelop the global economy to adjust to a fossil fuel-free world.\nSome people have pointed out that the response to the current crisis has reduced emissions and air pollution in the short term. But Jason Hickel, lecturer in economic anthropology at Goldsmiths University, warned of taking too many lessons from that.\n“When you scale down energy use and industrial production, it does have these ecological benefits but the crucial thing to observe is that this is happening in an unplanned, chaotic way which is hurting people’s lives,” he said. “We would never advocate such a thing. What we need is a planned approach to reducing unnecessary industrial activity that has no connection to human welfare and that disproportionately benefits already wealthy people as opposed to ordinary people. There are much more equitable, just and carefully planned ways to approach this kind of problem.”\nA group of leading economists and global health experts including four Nobel prize-winners has urged the leaders of the G20 countries to devote trillions to helping poor countries out of the coronavirus crisis, or face a continuing crisis of migration, recurring global Covid-19 outbreaks, and social breakdown in the developing world.\nThe experts said: “Developing countries are facing an unprecedented collective threat to human life, social cohesion and economic devastation. Massive economic losses will be incurred as countries desperately try to cope; people will migrate out of fear as the epidemic takes hold, leading to social disruption, violence and security issues.”\nErik Berglof, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics and an organiser of the letter, told the Guardian: “If it will take more than $2tn (£1.6bn), perhaps as much as $6tn, to fix the US, we are not going to fix the rest of the world for less. To attach a specific number now is almost meaningless. What we need are new and creative ways of using global financial muscle to back up existing international financial institutions.”\nHe said that some measures, such as providing emergency resources and medical help, could be taken quickly, but it was important to manage the process with a long-term view as well, using and expanding existing international institutions and programmes. “You cannot sprinkle money from helicopters in these economies because it would never reach the intended receivers,” he said. “You need carefully managed programmes and projects that can help these countries through this extremely difficult period.”\nInfrastructure investment would take longer, but would be vital to ensure that countries can recover from an economic shock that economists say will be greater than that following the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn providing this help, the developed world would also be benefiting its own citizens, as if efforts to control Covid-19 in poor countries fail, “the virus could become endemic, producing new waves of destructive outbreaks around the world”, the letter warned.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

It’s hard to imagine right now that, just weeks ago, the truism of ecological politics was treated as hippy nonsense by mainstream politics.\nAnnouncing the statutory review of the commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) last October, the Morrison government pitched it as an opportunity to weaken the Howard era laws even further and make it easier still for environmentally destructive projects to be approved. And, regardless of clear statements from scientists and strong advocacy by campaign groups, it looked like it would get away with it because, back then, we were still living in the age of disconnection when the environment and the economy could be seen as separate things, in competition with each other.\nBut then the summer arrived, delivering one after the other two massive wake-up calls. In the age of consequences, with the climate crisis and a deadly pandemic bearing down on us, it’s impossible to pretend that we are separate from each other and from the natural world.\n'The forest is now terribly silent': land set aside for threatened species entirely burnt out\nRead more\nA pandemic, more than almost any other phenomenon, shows that all our lives are inextricably intertwined, for now and forever, whether we like it or not. It brings into sharp focus the impossibility of trying to keep economics, health, environment, education and social justice treated as separate questions with separate answers. It heightens awareness of our vital need, as social beings, to stay connected to each other as well as we possibly can while keeping our physical distance.\nIt shows how the “efficient”, on-demand world that capitalism has constructed is so incredibly fragile that a series of shocks can bring it to the point of collapse. And with the rules of neoliberal economics being broken by governments the world over, it demonstrates that massive policy interventions, shifting the entire structure of the global economy, are possible.\nWith the complete focus right now on Covid-19, it takes an effort to cast our minds back to this summer’s bushfires. They were, of course, far larger and fiercer than ever before, over a season that started when we were barely out of winter. Where previously bushfires had affected a small number of people, this season the smoke blanketing Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and the repeated evacuation of summer holiday spots, meant that most Australians were affected.\nCovid-19, among other things, shows us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more\nThis heralded a shift in thinking that went deeper than personal impact. Perhaps due to the remarkably low loss of human life compared with the scale of the disaster, there was a tremendous focus on the more than a billion mammals, birds and reptiles killed. We mourned the thousands of koalas and the numerous species being pushed towards extinction if their habitats aren’t restored.\nThe true legacy of this summer could be a vital turning point in recognising that “the environment” isn’t something “over there”. The environment is the air we breathe and the water we drink; it’s the soil in which we grow our food; it’s the animals we identify with and the landscapes imprinted on our souls; the environment is us, all of us, together, integrally connected with everyone and everything else on this beautiful blue marble floating in space.\nDamage the environment and we damage ourselves. And not just some of us – all of us together. Continue to think in our compartmentalised, linear fashion, and we’ll keep missing what’s coming, be it weeks of smoke, runs on toilet paper, or deadly pandemics.\nWhat started to become clear thanks to the fires was rammed home by Covid-19. We are only as healthy as the least healthy among us. Everything we do relies on extraordinary networks of activity by people we’ve never met, crisscrossing the globe. And responding to a health crisis that was likely triggered in part by environmental destruction has world-changing impacts on the economy, on education, on social justice, on geopolitics.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nThe age of disconnection is over.\nTo bring us back to where we started, where does that leave the review of the EPBC Act?\nWe have an opportunity now to not just push for a new generation of environment laws, but to re-evaluate the whole deal, to cultivate a new political settlement based on ecological principles of living well together in harmony with the natural world, understanding our place as part of it as First Peoples did for millenniums, with an economy designed to serve people and planet.\nAs part of this, in the immediate term we need to advocate for vital improvements to the EPBC. It is extraordinary that the Howard legacy of deliberately excluding a project’s climate impacts from the triggers to require assessment still hasn’t been remedied. That must now be fixed, as must the fact that there is no mechanism for assessing the cumulative ecological impacts of various proposals. After this summer’s destruction of huge areas of remaining healthy ecosystems, we need to institute, in both legislation and the practice of assessment, a presumption of protection instead of a culture of managed destruction.\nAll this will, of course, be attacked as “green tape” and we have to be ready to actively defend it instead of changing the subject – and defend it on ecological grounds. Regulation is a vital part of the connective tissue which holds the body politic together. Removing it sees us fall apart. Covid-19 is, among other things, showing us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more.\nHaving that conversation in this way means we won’t just be advocating for marginal improvements, but will be working to change politics. We’ll be building into the political common sense the idea that corporations absolutely should be regulated to enforce environmental and social responsibilities, and that we can no longer consider shareholder profit to be their sole focus. That helps move our politics towards altering the DNA of corporations so they operate as part of the body politic rather than as cancer cells.\nThe flip side of this systemic shift is to institute legal rights for the natural world. If BHP has legal rights, why shouldn’t the Great Barrier Reef? Rights of nature is an increasingly mature legal field, instituted from New Zealand to Bolivia, India to parts of the US. We can and should at least insert them as a normative principle in the goals of the EPBC.\nWhile we’re thinking at that level, a new ecological political settlement will need a rethink of federalism. Our system sees national and state governments cooperating to shut out community participation and scientific advice to facilitate destructive development. An effective regime based on a presumption of protection would see federal, state, territory and local governments enabling communities to collectively develop creative ideas at their local level, within the context of expert scientific advice, and coordinating those ideas at a regional and continental level.\nIf we shift environmental regulation from a process that is primarily responsive to demands of developers into a proactive, constructive, community-led system, we can see it morph from a defensive protection stance into one of active restoration, repair and regeneration. It can lead to the greening of cities and towns as we embrace the fact that habitats are not just “over there” but among us. It can create industrial jobs in coalmine rehabilitation. It can support regenerative agriculture, and cooperative sharing of scarce water. It can even open space for community-led conversations about relocation as the overheating world retreats from rising seas and inland desertification is inevitable.\nSupporting and enabling communities to make decisions is also vital for rebuilding confidence in democracy, which has collapsed in recent years. The ongoing panic-buying response to Covid-19 suggests that the abject failure of government to provide leadership through the fires worsened this further. This is now an opportunity to rethink governance, reclaim agency for communities, build practices of trust and social cohesion, embedded in respect for expert advice.\nNow it’s important to recognise that with this government we’re not going to get these kinds of changes. At best we might hold off the push to weaken the EPBC even further. But that shouldn’t stop us advocating for what we need. Quite the opposite.\nPolitics, like the natural world it operates within, is a system. It works in complex ways because all it is is the collected actions of humans, influenced by each other and by external impetuses such as the weather. Or viruses.\nCoronavirus: 'Nature is sending us a message’, says UN environment chief\nRead more\nDonella Meadows, the modern mother of systems thinking, wrote that the most effective leverage point to change a system is “the mindset or paradigm out of which the system ... arises”. It’s critical, then, that we confront the paradigm which sees environmental protection as of marginal importance at best, and as a barrier at worst. It’s vital that we challenge the mindsets of human disconnection from and dominance over nature.\nOver the past three months, a huge number of people made that conceptual leap. In recent weeks the crisis has become such that even mainstream politics finds it impossible to ignore.\nAt the same time, over this period numerous people decided to just get on with it, without waiting for government. In both bushfire response and the tremendous mutual aid response to Covid-19, millions of us are setting up local projects, or joining existing ones, that make life better, generate social cohesion, reduce our footprint, and cultivate an ethic of care – for ourselves, for each other, for the natural world we are part of.\nIf enough of us start doing this in our communities, and if enough submissions to the EPBC inquiry call for reforms that are embedded in ecological thinking, we will be putting a whole lot of small chocks under the lever. Each of those chocks is tiny. But together they can tip the balance.\nAll of a sudden, especially at a moment like this, change will come.\n• Tim Hollo is executive director of the Green Institute and visiting fellow at the Australian National University’s school of regulation and global government (RegNet)\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Laws due to come into effect include tougher targets on vehicle CO2 emissions.\nIn a letter to the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the groups said production and sales of cars had stalled in many countries and companies were facing a cash crisis.\nCoronavirus UK lockdown causes big drop in air pollution\nRead more\nWhile appealing for more financial aid to maintain liquidity, the ACEA said activities such as development and testing would inevitably suffer, which “upsets the plans we had made to prepare ourselves for complying with existing and future EU laws and regulations within the applicable deadlines”.\nIt said: “We believe therefore that some adjustment would need to be made to the timing of these laws. Please be assured, however, that it is not our intention to question the laws as such nor the underlying objectives of road safety, climate change mitigation and protection of the environment.”\nEuropean laws on CO2 emissions of new vehicles have applied since 2015 and a further tightening of the rules is due in January 2021. Manufacturers could potentially face huge fines for non-compliance, although the targets have pushed production towards less polluting cars.\nCampaigners described the call as shameless. Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “Many industries are facing difficulties during this challenging period that require governments and corporations to protect their workers. But it would be a mistake to use this crisis as a reason to roll back on environmental regulations. One, it won’t suddenly restart car sales, and two, tackling one crisis can’t be done at the expense of another one.”\nJulia Poliscanova, the clean vehicle director at Transport and Environment, said: “The priority now is to ensure the health, safety and job security of the workers affected by the current factory closures. While the overall economic recovery is crucial, we shouldn’t let some opportunistic carmakers use the crisis to shamelessly roll back the EU climate targets for cars. Selling less cars won’t impact compliance with the law. What matters is the type of car you sell.”\nThe big German carmakers Daimler, VW and BMW have already indicated they are aiming to comply with the new CO2 targets regardless of the current situation.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe ACEA director general, Eric-Mark Huitema, said the industry was not questioning any specific laws or the underlying objectives of tackling the climate emergency. He said: “The primary concern of ACEA and all its members right now is to manage the immediate crisis facing the auto industry, which has essentially come to an abrupt halt – something the sector has never experienced before.\n“In this emergency context, it has not yet been possible to undertake a detailed analysis of the implications of this crisis on legislation affecting our industry. [But] there will inevitably be consequences in this domain.”\nThe European commission said it would respond to the letter from the car manufacturers in due course.\nHowever, the commission made it clear that the European green deal, announced last December and the flagship policy of von der Leyen, would continue. The green deal will encompass all aspects of European industry, transport and environmental regulation, and require steep emissions reductions to meet the intended bloc-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050.\nA spokesperson said: “The commission is determined to use all the policy tools at its disposal to help protect citizens and mitigate the coronavirus pandemic’s severely negative socioeconomic consequences. We must also ensure that the recovery is as sustainable as possible – both economically and environmentally.”\nShare your story\nShare your stories\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

When the next edition of every aspirant child’s bible comes out later this year, Richard Parks will be included for skiing more miles (2,299) in Antarctica, solo, unassisted and unsupported, than anyone else.\nIf geographical isolation is the measure, no one has been lonelier. And yet over the phone in our new reality he can be heard handling the demands of his two-year-old son, Freddie, with aplomb, even as he handles those of this interviewer on the other end of the line.\nRichard Parks interview: Extreme therapy\nRead more\n“Speaking frankly,” he says, when asked whether isolation is easier with wife and child in a flat in Cardiff Bay or on his own in the sprawling, frozen wilderness, “there are pros and cons. Every moment of every expedition I wish I was able to share it with my family and friends. It seems this cruel twist of fate has now landed us with exactly that wish. Managing the space together poses its own challenges. The other day I found Jo, who holds a pretty senior position, working in Freddie’s treehouse on the balcony in the flat.”\nParks’s relationship with isolation is long and poignant. Forged in the boisterous rough and tumble of professional rugby, he was plunged into turmoil when his career, which included four caps for Wales, was cut short by a shoulder injury in 2009. In his award-winning autobiography, Beyond the Horizon, he describes how he retreated into the bare, white room at the back of the house his parents were renting. Crippled by despair and fear, he holed up for 21 days, emerging from the room only for the toilet and, from the house, for an operation on his ruined shoulder.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRichard Parks passes the ball out during the Powergen Cup semi-final between Leeds Tykes and London Irish at Headingley in March 2005. Photograph: Gary M Prior/Getty Images\n“That first period of isolation was really painful,” he says. “I felt at sea with nothing to hold on to. I was completely powerless – over my emotions, over what had happened, the injury. That was terrifying, right. I can imagine there might be people going through feelings related to that now.”\nPowder to the people: Scottish slopes enjoy best conditions for years – in pictures\nA line from his grandmother’s funeral two years earlier – “the horizon is only the limit of our sight” – had resonated so deeply he had it tattooed on his forearm. While staring at it in that white room, he was struck by an epiphany. His horizons had closed in, but thenceforth he would embrace the brilliant whiteness of mountains, wildernesses and the unknown, where the horizon stretches farther than anywhere else on earth.\nHe launched himself into his new vocation, acquiring the skills of a mountaineer with remarkable facility. In 2011, he became the first to stand, in the same calendar year, at the highest peak of each of the seven continents and at the North and South Pole, known as the adventurers’ grand slam. He managed the feat in six and a half months.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nParks celebrates on 15 January 2020 after reaching the South Pole in 28 days after battling hunger, blizzards and freezing temperatures. Photograph: Hamish Frost/PA\nAdvertisement\nSince then, he has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity and worked with scientists as a kind of guinea pig at the extremes of human endeavour. But his current world record is not the one he had been seeking in his four expeditions to Antarctica, the first a training run in late 2012. Parks has been chasing a world record they say will never be broken.\nIn 2011, his friend Christian Eide of Norway skied the 715 miles from Hercules Inlet on the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in an astonishing 24 days, smashing the previous record of 39. The reason no one expects it to be broken is that the conditions were perfect throughout. Good weather is not something to rely upon in Antarctica, the driest, windiest and coldest continent.\nParks, in that sunny Antarctic summer of 2011, was on the first two legs of his adventurer’s grand slam and testifies the weather has deteriorated since, becoming snowier, wetter and warmer. Despite the conditions, in 2014, he became the second-fastest skier to the South Pole, in a time of 29 days.\nThe magnitude of the challenge beggars belief. A month’s worth of supplies and equipment must be hauled on a sled weighing roughly 70kg, as the challenger skis uphill from the coast to the Antarctic plateau, 3,000m above sea level, the height of an average Alp.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nParks talking polar sled design and wind tunnel testing with Cardiff Met product design students ahead of his expedition. Photograph: Courtesy of Richard Parks\nParks expended the calorific equivalent of two marathons a day in the most hostile environment on earth. Forced to abandon his second record attempt last year, because of even worse weather than usual, this year he skied for 16 hours a day, and slept for three, as he lowered his British record to 28 days in January. At halfway he was on course to break Eide’s world record. Then, sure enough, the weather turned, the wind howling at him from the pole with a chill factor of -45 degrees. By the time he finished, he had lost 14.5kg.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAdvertisement\n“I’m genuinely at peace with it,” he says of the knowledge the speed record seems out of reach in the current climate. “There are some things I can’t control. That’s what makes this different from mainstream sport. And there’s a beauty in that.”\nHe has not decided whether to try again. For now, the kind of isolation we are all wrestling with is preoccupying him more. “For any given expedition, there is years of preparation and training. With the current situation, we didn’t have that luxury. So we are all going through something akin to the grief curve.”\nIdentifying and honouring what he can and cannot control is Parks’s mantra. Through it, he has transformed isolation from the scourge of his very soul to the field in which he is now a world-record holder.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand. This resonated with so many readers around the world. We promise to update you on the steps we take to hold ourselves accountable at this defining point in our lifetimes.

In an interview in the design magazine Dezeen, the influential trend forecaster Li Edelkoort has called it a “quarantine on consumption” that is having a devastating impact on our economy and culture, but ultimately offers “a blank page to a new beginning”.\nWhile sections of the fashion industry already knew they could not continue on their current trajectory, it was inconceivable that brands could be forced to slow down, let alone stop production altogether. But that is what has happened as famous names from Prada to Zara have turned their production lines to making medical gowns and masks, and luxury houses have changed from making perfume to sanitisers. It’s an unprecedented interruption of an industry that has relied on speeding from one season’s sales to the next. And it is bringing with it a new sense of connectedness, responsibility and empathy.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWe are seeing ‘a new sense of connectedness, responsibility and empathy’. Photograph: Danai Tsouloufa\nUntil factories started to feel the effects of Covid-19, the global fashion business was producing 150bn items of clothing each year, far in excess of the needs of a global population of 7.9 billion. Clothing consumption globally was in 2017 projected to rise still more, by 63% by 2030, according to the Global Fashion Agenda and Boston Consulting Group. Who knows if those projections will be dented now that bricks-and-mortar shops are closed, orders have halted and supply chains have been stopped in their tracks?\nAdvertisement\nAs factory orders dry up, the lowly paid, overworked garment workers without sick pay or any financial cushion are the ones who are paying the biggest price. The question is how, when the self-isolation and fear abates, we can use this temporary moratorium on production to correct the course of a carbon-guzzling and exploitative industry. We cannot continue down this path of unchecked overproduction, waste and human misery.\n‘Imagine a whole new system that places the Earth’s needs before those of industrial growth.’ Photograph: Danai Tsouloufa/Earth Logic\nOn Saturday, people around the world will be reflecting on the temporary decrease in CO2 as they turn off their lights at 8.30pm (local time wherever they are), to take part in Earth Hour. This annual environmental campaign by WWF will remind us that, according to the UN, we have only 10 years to keep global warming to 1.5C. This is something the academics Kate Fletcher and Mathilda Tham are acutely aware of. In their new report, Earth Logic Fashion Action Research Plan, they write: “The time frame of 10 years is the same as a child’s time at school. One eighth of most people’s lifetime, or 10 annual reports for a business. Consider what you, your family, community, workplace will do in the coming 10 years. Every moment will count.”\nConscious, ethical and cruelty-free: a guide to the language of sustainable fashion\nRead more\nTheir argument pivots around the idea that the only way to ensure we cut carbon emissions and end the cycles of overproduction and waste is to imagine a whole new system that places the Earth’s needs before those of industrial growth. In a post-Covid-19 world, that’s beginning to look slightly more feasible. “We propose planet before industry as a radical idea in which the health and survival of our planet Earth is given precedence over business interests,” they write.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought into stark focus the fact that business as usual can be stopped in its tracks. Anything, it seems, is now possible. According to the environmental journalist and broadcaster Lucy Siegle, who wrote the foreword to the Earth Logic report, this break is a “lifeline” to the industry and a “chance to reboot our efforts and change our course based on evidence and fact”.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘We are seeing that in times of real emergency, people’s behaviour has to change.’\nAdvertisement\n“Once we realise that the current system is always going to be self-limiting as there are finite resources, putting Earth first is the only option,” says Fletcher, of the London College of Fashion’s Centre for Sustainable Fashion. This is not about tinkering around the edges of the existing way of working, creating “sustainable” collections or clothing recycling schemes: Earth Logic attacks the very root of the problem: the existing economic model itself. This means a shift from production to the maintenance, use and care of existing clothes. It means reducing the volume of clothes we produce, and in turn, the amount of resources we are using. It means moving from globalised, tangled and unsafe supply chains to small production centres based around the needs and desires of local communities. “We need to find a role for industry scattered across communities,” says Fletcher, with multiple local hubs for people to be educated, to make and repair their clothes.\nPatriarchy and growth logic are inextricably intertwined, says Tham. The same sorts of people are making the same sorts of decisions. According to Earth Logic, there would be respect for “fashion in non-western geographies. We can train the focus of fashion on supporting race and gender equality. Each perspective offers new models and practices for relating with fashion as well as broadening and diversifying the base of fashion expertise.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAcademics Kate Fletcher and Mathilda Tham, who wrote the new report, Earth Logic , a Fashion Action Research Plan Photograph: Publicity image\nThese are all points the next generation coming into the industry is demanding, too. “The questions students are asking are very different now,” says Tham, who teaches fashion and economics students at the Linnaeus University, Sweden. How we design clothes must connect with the needs of society and the environment and work with them, not against them. We are seeing this happening with designers looking for ways to help make protective equipment and gowns for medical teams. These new positive role models must be allowed to lead the way forward.\nSign up for the Fashion Statement email\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nWe have uncertain and painful times ahead. But Fletcher says: “It’s about trying not to look away when the going gets hard.” We are seeing that in times of real emergency, people’s behaviour has to change. Even pressing pause on fashion’s relentless cycle for a season (possibly two) will have a profound effect. Already, so much has changed. The cycle of fashion for fashion’s sake has been broken. We must use this time to rethink how this industry can be redesigned with respect for the planet and the health of the people who work in it.\n“It’s like turning a kaleidoscope and seeing new patterns emerge,” says Tham. “There are so many possible patterns. Things can change very quickly when we have a new perspective. It is not impossible.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times.

The price of some vegetables in Australia has gone up considerably recently.\nThese price increases have led many people to take to social media, accusing major supermarkets and independent retailers of profiteering and price gouging at a time of crisis.\nHowever, Shaun Lindhe, the communications manager for peak vegetable growers body AusVeg, suggests that the price increases have more to do with another story, one that has fallen from the headlines in recent weeks: the ongoing, devastating droughts and bushfires that ravaged Australia over the summer.\n“There’s been a reduced supply as a result of drought,” Lindhe says. “There’s also seasonal fluctuations in supply, as production regions transition.”\nThe reduced supply has coincided with panicked shoppers clearing shelves, driving prices even higher.\nSign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance, our daily email newsletter\nGo to ground amid coronavirus: how to grow a living pantry to eat this winter\nRead more\nOn 24 March, ACCC chair Rod Sims directly attributed grocery price hikes to “unnecessary panic buying”, saying: “Australia’s supermarkets have experienced unprecedented demand for groceries in recent weeks, both in store and online, which has led to shortages of some products and disruption to delivery services.\n“In order to meet that demand growers and retailers have been working to try and keep that supply on supermarket shelves,” says Lindhe, “and as a result some of the production costs in terms of labour and transport have gone up.”\nIn January, well before the novel coronavirus crisis hit Australian shores and shifted consumer behaviour, growers warned of a 50% increase in vegetable prices. Now a supply shortage is coinciding with a spike in demand.\nMatthew Broadbent, a produce manager for Green Green Grocer, a small vegetable box delivery service in Melbourne, has noticed the price hikes at a wholesale level.\n“It is across the board, but especially broccoli, celery and cauliflower,” Broadbent tells Guardian Australia. “As a percentage, we’re looking at as much as double in some cases … Prices do go up and down at times, but I’ve never seen it like this before.\n“At the moment our margins are a lot slimmer,” Broadbent says, although he has seen an increase in customers over the last few weeks too.\nBroadbent’s experience chimes with statements from Coles and Woolworths. “Coles has seen wholesale price increases on some fresh produce lines due to factors including limited availability as a result of bushfires and drought,” a representative tells Guardian Australia.\nA Woolworths spokesperson, meanwhile, says: “Due to pressures throughout the horticultural supply chain caused by drought, unseasonal weather and an unprecedented spike in demand, we’re currently seeing an impact on the availability of some fresh fruit and vegetable lines. This has led to higher wholesale costs for some fruit and vegetable lines across the market.”\n“The price of vegetables, like many commodities, is set by supply and demand,” says Lindhe.\nBoth supermarkets firmly deny price hikes are a result of profit-seeking, with a Coles spokesperson saying that “Coles has absorbed some of these increases”.\n“I haven’t heard of any reports of price gouging,” says Lindhe. “The situation we’ve got at the moment is that the level of supply has lowered ... and that coupled with the increased demand ... as a result the prices have gone up.”\nBecause the “vast majority” of fresh vegetables available in Australia are grown locally, Lindhe does not expect international supply chain issues caused by the Covid-19 crisis to impact Australians.\nLindhe is optimistic that the situation will resolve itself soon. “As availability of fresh produce increases over time, as we expect it will, demand levels will resume to what we normally expect for this time of year, and as a result of that, price will lower to reflect the increased availability.”\nCoronavirus measures could cause global food shortage, UN warns\nRead more\nIn the short term, major supermarkets have also relaxed their specifications for the size and cosmetic appearance of vegetables, in order to increase supply, ABC reports.\nWhile the Covid-19 crisis and drought have driven vegetable prices up, Australians can look forward to cheaper high end seafood this autumn, as export demand for Australian seafood plummets.\nJosh Pearce, of the Fish Shoppe in Melbourne, tells Guardian Australia that the price of rock lobster has almost halved in recent months. “The main market was China and retailed at Christmas for $150. It has now dropped to $100 when the Chinese market closed and this weekend we will be selling at $85 a kilogram, which is nearly half of its original price.”\nPearce notes that mud crabs and sashimi-grade yellowfin tuna are also particularly cheap at the moment, as restaurants and export markets close. “Australians can now enjoy higher-end species … at bargain price.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat-controlled House, had proposed a requirement for airlines to cut their planet-warming emissions in half by 2050, but that provision is not in the bill.\n$1,200 stimulus checks for all? What to know about the US coronavirus bailout\nRead more\nThe House is expected to vote on the package on Friday. It also includes nearly $500bn in lending authority that one environment group, Friends of the Earth, called a “corporate slush fund with insufficient guardrails to protect workers, taxpayers and the climate”.\nCongressional Republicans have accused Democrats of taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue climate policy. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week that Democrats were “bargaining as usual” with “counter-offers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels”. Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis.\nIn the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside.\nAnnie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid.\n“The provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they’re going to do,” Petsonk said. “People do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.” The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes.\nThe bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve “significant discussions of green objectives”.\n“Was this a missed opportunity for climate? I think the answer to that is no,” Segal said. “This stimulus package was primarily about getting money into the hands of individual households and workers and in some service sectors that were particularly hurt.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nKevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, said: “Congress is going to be making more deals, and as long as there is a deal to be made, Democrats have made clear what they want.”\nDemocrats negotiated multiple measures meant to prevent abuse of the $500bn available in lending, including an oversight board, a special inspector general and provisions aimed at limiting Donald Trump’s businesses from benefiting – an issue that has already come under scrutiny.\nBut climate hawks said those stipulations were not strong enough. “What makes this so frightening is that there are very few binding restrictions on how this money can be used that the secretary of treasury cannot waive,” said Lukas Ross, a senior policy analyst with Friends of the Earth.\n“It’s great that [Trump’s son-in-law ] Jared Kushner isn’t going to get a subsidised line of credit. It’s much more worrying in human terms that Chevron, Exxon and every other polluter you can imagine is eligible to be propped up in terms of the stimulus package.”\nThe bill also does not include specific assistance to the renewable energy industry, although trade associations and lobbyists expect to revisit that possibility as discussions continue about more targeted aid for at-risk sectors of the economy.\nShare your story\nShare your stories\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

British homes are using more electricity as people stay in and work from home, but this increase has been more than offset by the steep drop in demand for electricity at factories, construction sites and offices.\nElectricity demand is expected to fall further as major industries continue to close down to help stem the spread of the pandemic, which should help lead to lower overall emissions in 2020 alongside rising renewable energy generation.\nMore than a third (36.9%) of the UK’s electricity was generated by renewable energy sources including wind farms, solar panels and biomass-fuelled power plants in 2019, a record for the sector. The average in the last three months of the year rose to 37.4%, the highest ever recorded for this time of year.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWind power alone generated almost a fifth of the UK’s electricity over the year as a whole, divided equally between onshore and offshore wind projects, in large part boosted by rising generation from the new Hornsea offshore wind project off the Yorkshire coast, which is the largest offshore wind farm in the world.\nMelanie Onn, RenewableUK’s deputy chief executive, said the records will continue as the UK moves away from fossil fuels to reach net zero emissions as fast as possible.\n“As well as wind, we’ll use innovative new technologies like renewable hydrogen and marine power, and we’ll scale up battery storage,” she said.\n“Low-cost renewables are central to the government’s energy strategy and our sector will grow rapidly in the years ahead, as our domestic supply chain expands and we continue to seize multibillion pound export opportunities around the world,” Onn added.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

He was joined on the trip by an observer from the marine park authority.\nIn a statement, the authority said the accumulation of heat, particularly through February, had caused bleaching across large areas of the reef. The severity of the damage varied widely, but some southern areas that had been spared during mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 had now experienced moderate or severe bleaching.\nIt noted there was positive news for the tourism industry: reefs they rely on in the northern and central parts, including near Cairns and Port Douglas, experienced only moderate bleaching, and most corals there should recover. Some pockets of the reef remain unaffected by bleaching.\nAdvertisement\nThe authority said it would have a better understanding of the extent and severity of the bleaching once surveys finished on Friday, with analysis to continue over coming weeks.\n“Once the aerial surveys are complete we will be able to compare this event to those of 2016 and 2017,” the statement said.\nIt stressed bleached corals would not necessarily die. “On mildly or moderately bleached reefs there is a good chance most bleached corals will recover and survive this event,” it said. “Equally, on severely bleached reefs, there will be higher mortality of corals.”\nGlobal heating caused by escalating atmospheric greenhouse gases is a major threat to the world’s coral reef ecosystems. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution.\nGreat Barrier Reef outlook now 'very poor', Australian government review says\nRead more\nAbout half the reef’s shallow water corals bleached and died in 2016 and 2017.\nThe authority reiterated that climate change was the “single greatest challenge” facing the reef. “While the strongest possible global efforts to reduce emissions are essential, it is critically important we continue to deliver the work already being undertaken to enhance the resilience of the reef,” it said.\nEnvironment groups said the mass bleaching underlined the need to move away from fossil fuels.\nAustralian Marine Conservation Society campaigner Shani Tager said the news was devastating for the reef, the species it supports and the communities that rely on its health. She said reef industries reeling from the impact of coronavirus needed short- and long-term support.\n“When the restrictions from this pandemic lift we will need the beautiful places in this world like our reef more than ever to heal, reconnect with each other and the natural world,” she said. “That means we need a healthy reef and climate policies that will give it a fighting chance.”\nKate Smolski, from Greenpeace Australia, said future economic stimulus packages must include measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Gavan McFadzean, from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “With help, the tourism industry can recover after Covid-19, but only if there is a healthy Great Barrier Reef to visit once this crisis is over.”\nSpecific observations from the aerial surveys include:\nInshore and offshore reefs between Tully and Townsville were severely bleached.\nOffshore areas in the northern section, including highly valued tourism reefs, were more moderately bleached.\nInner and mid-shelf reefs between Townsville and Mackay were mostly severely bleached, though some areas used by the tourism industry were only moderately bleached.\nBleaching of reefs in the Swains and Pompey groups, at the marine park’s far southeast, was highly variable, with some severe, some moderate and some with minor or no damage.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Some of this data has been invaluable in drawing up detailed pictures of the British climate, which have been influential in computer models used to forecast climate change.\nBut some of it is still effectively unusable because it is marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. They hope that hundreds of people currently stuck indoors with little else to do will be inspired to join up to help digitise rainfall data for use by meteorologists and climate experts.\nUnder the Rainfall Rescue project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records.\nAdvertisement\n“We are set to reach in time to rescue millions of pieces of UK rainfall data that are currently going to waste in filing cabinets,” said Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. “These records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.”\nThanks to Britain’s weather obsession, there are records from several thousand rainfall gauges sited across the country from the 1950s alone, but only a few hundred have been digitised so far.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe UK’s variable climate, which scientists recently suggested was responsible for disguising some of the impacts of the climate crisis while the impacts in other parts of the world are growing more obvious, makes it crucial to understand why some parts of the UK are wetter or drier than others and to discern long-term trends.\nFor instance, extreme years – a year-long drought in 1921 and the notoriously wet summer of 1912 – can tell scientists a lot, and their understanding will be vastly improved if the weather sources from those years can be viewed at last. Water companies and government planners will also benefit, as the resilience of current systems can be compared with real historical conditions.\nThis is the biggest such project yet, and Hawkins hopes to amass as near complete a record as possible from the 1820s to the 1960s, when digitised records began.

More generally, if successive governments hadn’t sold off the plum state-owned assets, the government might now have more options for cushioning current pain.\nOne could go on but you get the idea: the failures of today stem from the choices of the past.\nTo put it another way, if there’s an economic alternative now, there was an economic alternative then – and we are all suffering from the ideologically-driven failure to take it.\nNow, we can’t step back in time. But we can change what happens next.\nThe Covid-19 catastrophe demonstrates – if any demonstration is needed – that prevention is better than cure. It shows that scientific experts know, by and large, what they’re talking about, and that their modelling accurately predicts real world effects.\nThe implications for climate change could not be more obvious.\nScientists have told us, over and over again, that a warming planet will deliver increasingly horrific disasters, with the recent Australian bushfires a taste of what’s to come.\nAfter the last weeks, it’s simply not credible to say nothing can be done about the rising temperatures. We don’t have to wait for some market mechanism to sort things out.\nHope in the time of coronavirus lies in rebuilding the state\nVan Badham\nRead more\nOther alternatives exist – and the sooner we embrace them, the less disruption we face.\nIn the end, ideology matters less than material interest. The politicians currently buffeted by extraordinary events will, quite soon, recover their equilibrium – and, when they do, we should expect a return to the old rhetoric, as the big end of town insists the rest of us pay for what’s happened.\nIndeed, the economic devastation will be used to justify more of the same indifference to the threats of the future, with climate action dismissed as a job-killing indulgence in a time of mass unemployment.\nBut it doesn’t have to be like that. We have a chance to build from the wreckage – to learn from this crisis and prevent the crisis we know is coming.\nIf we don’t, it will all happen again.\n• Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Last September, satellite images revealed the ozone hole annual peak had shrunk to 16.4m sq km, the smallest extent since 1982.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“It’s a success story. This is more evidence that the Montreal protocol has led to the recovery of the ozone layer,” said the study’s lead author, Antara Banerjee, who works in the chemical sciences division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is a visiting fellow at the University of Boulder, Colorado.\nThe expected effect on people will vary from region to region. In Patagonia (southern Chile and Argentina), there should be more rain and less carcinogenic ultra-violet light. The findings will be of more concern for central South America (Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina), where ozone depletion was previously found to bring more rainfall and wider bands of agricultural production. The same may also be true of east Africa and other desert areas in the mid-latitudes.\nPrevious studies suggest the reversal may also be good news for Australia, which has suffered more drought because the movement of the jet stream pushed rain-bearing storms away from its coast during winter. Whether this is enough to offset the rise in carbon emissions is another matter.\nThe restoration of ozone is not enough to push southern hemisphere weather patterns back on to a normal track because other industrial emissions – such as carbon dioxide and methane – continue to exert a disruptive force in the opposite direction.\n“There is a tug of war between ozone recovery and increasing CO2. That’s why we are seeing a pause. In the near future, the ozone factor could dominate and the jet stream will move back towards equator. But once the recovery is complete, CO2 could push it southwards again,” Banerjee said.\nAlexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the paper who works for the Finnish Meteorological Institute, said the paper illustrated how ozone depletion had been the main driver in atmospheric circulation.\n“This is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change,” he said. “We can see coordinated action works. It is a strong message to us as emitters of greenhouse gases. This shows we can manipulate the climate both ways: in a wrong way and by reversing the damage we have done.”\nWhether this will affect the loss of Antarctic sea ice remains a major unanswered question. Previous studies suggested the ozone hole had a chimney-like effect that sucked some of the heat out of the atmosphere, which meant the south pole warmed more slowly than the north. But Banerjee said such a view was controversial and required further study.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand. This resonated with so many readers around the world. We promise to update you on the steps we take to hold ourselves accountable at this defining point in our lifetimes.

They said it was almost always human behaviour that caused diseases to spill over into humans.\nTo prevent further outbreaks, the experts said, both global heating and the destruction of the natural world for farming, mining and housing have to end, as both drive wildlife into contact with people.\nThey also urged authorities to put an end to live animal markets – which they called an “ideal mixing bowl” for disease – and the illegal global animal trade.\nAndersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the immediate priority was to protect people from the coronavirus and prevent its spread. “But our long-term response must tackle habitat and biodiversity loss,” she added.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\n“Never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass from wild and domestic animals to people,” she told the Guardian, explaining that 75% of all emerging infectious diseases come from wildlife.\n“Our continued erosion of wild spaces has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbour diseases that can jump to humans.”\nShe also noted other environmental impacts, such as the Australian bushfires, broken heat records and the worst locust invasion in Kenya for 70 years. “At the end of the day, [with] all of these events, nature is sending us a message,” Anderson said.\n“There are too many pressures at the same time on our natural systems and something has to give,” she added. “We are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not. If we don’t take care of nature, we can’t take care of ourselves. And as we hurtle towards a population of 10 billion people on this planet, we need to go into this future armed with nature as our strongest ally.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn orangutan seeks refuge from a bulldozer as loggers smash the base of a tree in the Ketapang district, West Borneo. Photograph: International Animal Rescue\nAdvertisement\nHuman infectious disease outbreaks are rising and in recent years there have been Ebola, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), West Nile virus and Zika virus all cross from animals to humans.\n“The emergence and spread of Covid-19 was not only predictable, it was predicted [in the sense that] there would be another viral emergence from wildlife that would be a public health threat,” said Prof Andrew Cunningham, of the Zoological Society of London. A 2007 study of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak concluded: “The presence of a large reservoir of Sars-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a timebomb.”\nCunningham said other diseases from wildlife had much higher fatality rates in people, such as 50% for Ebola and 60%-75% for Nipah virus, transmitted from bats in south Asia. “Although, you might not think it at the moment, we’ve probably got a bit lucky with [Covid-19],” he said. “So I think we should be taking this as a clear warning shot. It’s a throw of the dice.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWild animals sold at the Wuhan Huanan seafood market in China, linked to first cases of the coronavirus pandemic.

Markets butchering live wild animals from far and wide are the most obvious example, he said. A market in China is believed to have been the source of Covid-19.\n“The animals have been transported over large distances and are crammed together into cages. They are stressed and immunosuppressed and excreting whatever pathogens they have in them,” he said. “With people in large numbers in the market and in intimate contact with the body fluids of these animals, you have an ideal mixing bowl for [disease] emergence. If you wanted a scenario to maximise the chances of [transmission], I couldn’t think of a much better way of doing it.”\nChina has banned such markets, and Cunningham said this must be permanent. “However, this needs to be done globally. There are wet markets throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and a lot of other Asian countries too.” The ease of travel in the modern world exacerbates the dangers, he said, adding: “These days, you can be in a central African rainforest one day and in central London the next.”\nAaron Bernstein, at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said the destruction of natural places drives wildlife to live close to people and that climate change was also forcing animals to move: “That creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.”\nAdvertisement\n“We’ve had Sars, Mers, Covid-19, HIV. We need to see what nature is trying to tell us here. We need to recognise that we’re playing with fire,” he said.\n“The separation of health and environmental policy is a ​dangerous delusion. Our health entirely depends on the climate and the other organisms we share the planet with.”\nThe billion-dollar illegal wildlife trade is another part of the problem, said John Scanlon, the former secretary general of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThousands of frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burnt in Indonesia, after a pangolin bust conducted by the police.

People on average use 143 litres of water every 24 hours.\nGareth Davies, comptroller and auditor general of the NAO, criticised ministers in his report for failing to lead on the issue of water sustainability. He said personal water consumption had risen every year for the past five years.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHe called on the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) to co-ordinate a national approach to encouraging consumers and public bodies to reduce their water usage in an attempt to avoid water shortages in the coming decades.\nHe said: “The government has made limited progress on reducing water consumption, tackling leakage and sharing water resources between regions in the last five years, but rapid progress is now vital for the government to deliver its objective of a resilient water supply.\n“Defra needs to provide stronger leadership to water companies, regulators and consumers.”\nThe report said during the past five years water companies had made little or no progress in reducing water consumption and cutting leakage.\nThe NAO urged the government to monitor progress on the water suppliers’ pledge to reduce leaks by at least 15% by 2025.\nThe report said ministers in 2018 committed to announcing a personal water consumption target but had yet to follow through on the promise.\nThe NAO said it wanted Defra to promote a “more coherent and credible message” about water efficiency and develop a plan to evaluate its impact, with Whitehall leading on getting the message to consumers that they needed to save water.\nDefra should work with other government departments to reduce water consumption by large public sector users, such as hospitals and schools. The NAO said Defra should also better understand how willing the public were to pay higher water bills in order to improve water infrastructure.\nThe regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency should also have a role to play in regularly reviewing water companies’ progress on reducing consumption and leakage, the report recommended.\nA Defra spokesperson said: “We thank the NAO for this report as an important contribution to our work to meet our future water needs. We recognise that we need to work harder than ever to ensure that we all have enough water in the future and that is why we are already working towards many the report’s recommendations.\n“The recently published National Framework for Water Resources sets out a bold vision for bringing together consumers, businesses and industry to safeguard the future of our water resources while ensuring that our natural environment is protected for future generations.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In the rich nations, we have begun to believe we have transcended the material world. The wealth we’ve accumulated – often at the expense of others – has shielded us from reality. Living behind screens, passing between capsules – our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls – we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards.\nNow the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished storms through our lives. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long.\nThe planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it’s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them.\nA large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being hammered by drought, floods, fire and locusts (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of anomalous tropical cyclones). When we call such hazards “biblical”, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nIn his forthcoming book, Our Final Warning, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become too high for humans to tolerate, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to exceed the lethal thresholds for crop plants across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into dust bowls. Simultaneous global harvest failure – something that has never happened in the modern world – becomes highly likely.\nIn combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and pollinators, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps its promises under the Paris agreement, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C.\nAdvertisement\nThanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don’t need to change. When I challenge them, I’m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven’t experienced since I opposed the Iraq war. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like lab-grown food, is scarcely anywhere.\nBut this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on many livestock farms. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to deliver bacterial resistance.\nIn the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with veterinary antibiotics, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the search for new drugs. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers.\nOur multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the Bath Half Marathon, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. “It is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.” In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts – the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths – it might cause.\nThe amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments – but at least they got there in the end. Sunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life.\nThere are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who claims that the coronavirus is nothing more than “a little flu”. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him.\nOr this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life. This coronavirus reminds us that we belong to the material world.\n• George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Once QE and government spending are – hopefully – providing adequate resources for the health service, and the necessary financial cushion for businesses and workers, it will be time to urgently consider what lessons can be learned to tackle the other all-pervasive threat to our future – the climate emergency.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nCentral bankers used “bankers’ QE” to help tackle the 2008 financial crisis and are now turning to “coronavirus QE”. While working to bring this latest threat to human health under some degree of control, it is time to also plan for “green QE” to fund a global green new deal to transform the health of the planet. In the UK this would involve the Bank of England e-printing hundreds of billions of pounds. A new national investment bank would issue bonds that would be bought using QE and the money used to fund a green and decentralised infrastructure programme. This could include a decades-long, multi-skilled initiative involving energy refits of all 30 million UK buildings, a shift to localised renewable energy and food production, and the building of local transport and flood defence systems. The last war led to the NHS; this one must result in a green new deal.\nColin Hines\nConvener, UK Green New Deal Group\n• In his excellent opinion column on how the coronavirus crisis will transform our current economic and social models, William Davies says: “It may end up devaluing urban centres, as it becomes clear how much ‘knowledge-based work’ can be done online” (The last global crisis didn’t change the world. But this one could, 24 March).\nI live close to the City of London. The usually congested streets there are almost deserted; most financial buildings stand empty. If the financial system can apparently carry on with a large proportion of its workforce working from home, we must ask whether we actually need the massive conglomeration of mainly ugly, expensive, energy-guzzling buildings that I can see from my window.\nIt seems more and more evident that these glassy towers, still being built and rebuilt even as I write, now mainly serve as the vanity projects of corporate bosses. Perhaps this outdated model of financial centralisation is already redundant? Without great loss, couldn’t they be turned over, at least to a large extent, to housing for the UK’s homeless – or other socially useful projects?\nCarl Gardner\nLondon\n• William Davies and others are suggesting that the Covid-19 crisis is the sort of world-making event that allows for new economic and intellectual thinking. If we take the response to the climate crisis as an example, we may be overly optimistic. Many of us have been campaigning for many years, but only now has the world paid attention when teenage activists have spoken truth to power. Yet governments and corporations are still dragging their feet or are in denial.\nOne crisis is due to carelessness, the second to misfortune; who knows if there will be a third. Covid-19 has motivated community action and, while we are in lockdown, we could bring together disparate thinkers and activists to form online citizens’ assemblies. We need the reach to be as wide as possible; this can’t be just an academic exercise. There are many with the experience to lead and coordinate, and crowdfunding would finance a long-term initiative. Unless we speak truth to power and can coherently argue our case with policy, strategic and practical solutions, it will be business as near usual as possible.\nRosamund Aubrey\nSt Ishmaels, Haverfordwest\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

As with the climate crisis, neoliberal capitalism is proving particularly ill-suited to this.\nLike global warming, but in close-up and fast-forward, the Covid-19 outbreak shows how lives are lost or saved depending on a government’s propensity to acknowledge risk, act rapidly to contain it, and share the consequences.\nOn these matters, competence and ideology overlap. Governments willing to intervene have been more effective at stemming the virus than laissez-faire capitalists. The further right the government, the more inclined it is to delay action and offload blame elsewhere. International comparisons suggest this could be making infection and death rates steeper.\nThe rest of Europe views the UK's coronavirus plan with disbelief\nGiles Tremlett\nRead more\nTake the US, where Donald Trump is only now acknowledging the seriousness of the pandemic after weeks of claiming fears were exaggerated. Until recently, his government put more money into shielding the oil industry than providing adequate testing kits. He reportedly ordered officials to downplay early warnings because he did not want bad news in an election year. The US now has one of the fastest rising numbers of new cases in the world.\nIn Brazil, the ultra-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is equally reckless. He claimed the risks of coronavirus were overblown, until 17 of his aides and security detail tested positive after a trip to the US. Last weekend, he ignored his own government’s advice and chose to shake hands and pose cheek-to-cheek for selfies at a mass rally of supporters. As cases and deaths surge, his support has plummeted.\nIn the UK, Boris Johnson acknowledged the risk, but did little about it. Though not as extreme in his denial as Trump or Bolsonaro, Johnson’s government first dithered, then dabbled with a policy of “herd-immunity”that was reportedly driven by Dominic Cummings’ desire to protect the economy, even if it cost pensioners’ lives. The UK has since shifted tack and enforced a lockdown, but its controls are still haphazard. Last week, daily deaths in the UK were reckoned to be on a steeper upward curve than Italy was at the same stage.\nBy contrast, more interventionist governments – generally but not exclusively those which are centrist or leftwing – have acted more quickly and shared the burden of risk more widely. Norway, Denmark and Sweden already appear to have flattened the coronavirus curve. Spain and France implemented lockdowns at around 200 deaths, which the UK and US have far surpassed.\nIn Asia, China initially attempted to hide the problem from the public when the virus emerged in Wuhan, then mobilised huge public resources to enforce a strict lockdown and provide extra hospital beds. South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand also appear to have turned the corner thanks to different combinations of extensive testing, quarantine measures and public health education.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nOther factors are at play. Asian countries with prior experience of the Sars epidemic appear to have been better prepared. Italy, one of the worst affected countries, has one of the world’s oldest populations. In Japan’s case, the relatively flat curve of confirmed cases may also be a result of the government’s unwillingness to do widespread testing because it could jeopardise the Olympics.\nSimilarly, the relatively low number of cases in the global south has raised hopes that warmer weather might slow the disease – but this is far from certain. A comparatively low number of coronavirus cases could be the result of a lag caused by distance from the origin of the disease, relatively lower levels of international traffic, and fewer resources for testing.\nThis pandemic has amplified the importance of assessing and controlling risk before it gets out of hand. But the political champions of the neoliberal right, such as Trump and Bolsonaro, are more inclined to deny and delay, as climate politics have shown us in recent years.\nWhen it comes to a pandemic like Covid-19, that position is untenable. No leader can deny the science, nor can they endlessly delay action as they have done on global heating. Muddling through until the next election is not an option; leaders will be judged on deaths next week, not emissions reductions in 2050.\nUK coronavirus: 12,000 former NHS workers to return and emergency hospital to open as death toll rises – as it happened\nRead more\nThe demographics are also completely different. Unlike the climate crisis, the virus predominantly threatens the elderly – the right’s core support group – rather than millennials. So far, the worst affected regions are also closer to the centre of economic power: the cool industrialised north rather than the warmer developing south (though the latter may suffer more in the future due to weaker healthcare systems).\nFor the right, this makes the pandemic a greater political threat than the climate crisis has ever been. Unless they can quickly get on top of the disease, they will lose any claim to being champions of national security. It is entirely possible that the effects of this pandemic could be one of the most catastrophic failures of free-market capitalism.\nThis should also be a lesson for the left. If state intervention and scientific advice is effective in dealing with the virus, the same principles should be applied more aggressively towards the still more apocalyptic threats of climate disruption and the collapse of nature. Until now, the left has recognised these dangers, but done little to act on them because economic growth has always taken precedence.\nThe pandemic has proved that delays are deadly and expensive. If we are to avoid a cascade of future crises, governments must think beyond a return to business as usual. Our conception of what is “normal” will have to change. We’ll need to invest in natural life-supporting systems such as a stable climate, fresh air and clean water. In the past, those goals have been dismissed as unrealistic or expensive, but recent weeks have shown how quickly the political compass can shift.\nFirst though, we need to accept – and share – risk. Instead of deferring risks to future generations, weaker populations and natural systems, governments need to transform risks into responsibilities we all bear. The longer we hesitate, the fewer resources we will have at our disposal, and the more risk we will have to divide.\n• Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

The threat from climate change is as real as the threat from Covid-19, though it seems far away.”\n“Money has poured into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement [of 2015],” she said. “That can’t continue.”\nBut she said the changes wrought in societies around the world by dealing with Covid-19 would also demonstrate to people that the changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future were much less drastic and far more palatable. As far as the climate was concerned, “we must not go back to bad habits afterwards”, she said. “It will be easier to persuade people, as we have had to change so dramatically because of this threat.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nEconomic plans worth trillions of dollars in public money are being rolled out to stave off the immediate collapse of some badly hit businesses, such as airlines and tourism – and to protect the incomes of workers in danger of redundancy as normal life becomes impossible across Europe and large parts of the US, as it already has in many parts of east Asia.\nBut while people’s health and the immediate welfare of workers caught up in the crisis are paramount, campaigners and experts fear that if the longer-term packages are not carefully designed they will only entrench fossil fuel dependence across the global economy.\n“Governments are drawing up stimulus plans to counter the economic damage from coronavirus,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. “These stimulus packages offer an excellent opportunity to ensure that the essential task of building a secure and sustainable energy future doesn’t get lost amid the flurry of immediate priorities.”\nQuick guide\nWhat are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor?\nShow\nWhat is Covid-19?\nCovid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.\nWhat are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?\nAccording to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.\nAbout one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.\nIn the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:\na high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back\na new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly\nAs this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.\nShould I go to the doctor if I have a cough?\nMedical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nWas this helpful?\nThe Bank of England is resuming its quantitative easing programme of buying up assets to create liquidity in the financial system, as it did after the 2008 crash, but there are concerns that the programme has previously been used to buy bonds from fossil fuel companies including Shell, BP and Total.\nThere have been calls in some areas, such as eastern Europe and in Asia, to ignore climate concerns and pour stimulus money into existing high-carbon businesses and fossil fuels, rather than seeking a balance with a longer-term view that includes the need to curb emissions.\nJohn Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said governments must act urgently to protect people’s livelihoods, which could be done without directing the money to prop up ailing sectors whose long-term future was already threatened by the climate crisis.\n“Decisions are being made now about whether to spend billions rescuing airlines, cruise ships, the oil and gas industry, among many others,” he said. “Bailing out the shareholders of dirty industries to continue businessasusual rather than protecting workers and their families means we would have learnt nothing from the bank bailout during the financial crisis.”\nGreen campaigners have long talked about a “just transition” that would enable workers to move away from fossil fuel-dependent jobs and into skilled jobs with long-term low-carbon prospects. They argue this is compatible with tackling the coronavirus, too – but only if governments resist calls to downgrade environmental aims in light of the new crisis.\n“Diluting or doing away with environmental regulations to get a quick economic hit, as China and Poland are suggesting, would be misplaced – out of the frying pan, into the fire, even if the fire seems a few years away,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “It is striking that the ruling party in South Korea has not let coronavirus deter it from proposing a green new deal election manifesto. But I would expect the UK to prioritise the immediate economic impact while also applying a climate lens and thinking about the longer term.”\nIn the US, campaigners are concerned that Donald Trump’s hostility to climate science and wooing of fossil fuel industries will skew the economic rescue packages in harmful ways. The planned bailout for airlines and the cruise industry’s request for cash are an immediate worry.\n“Given that airlines produce a very large and growing amount of climate pollution, any financial assistance should include requirements that these companies take action to reduce their emissions,” said Annie Petsonk of the US-based Environmental Defense Fund. “The cruise industry, which has also requested billions in aid, has serious environmental impacts as well, and should meet new standards in exchange for government funding.”\nShe said that in return for public money, companies should give firm commitments on carbon. “[That] would be a major step in the fight against climate change. Taxpayers, many of whom are now struggling financially, have the right to expect responsible behaviour in exchange for bailouts. They should not be funding private businesses only to see them create more costs for the public – in the form of climate impacts – in the future.”\nFor many experts, the vital point is that the lessons from the stimulus following the financial crisis more than a decade ago are learned. Then, as now, global greenhouse gas emissions paused as the crisis hit. But after the immediate impact, emissions began their steady rise again and have continued to do so since, partly because the chance was missed to use the vast amounts of public money to set the world on a green path.\n“Given the state will never again play such a powerful role in our economy, and more broadly the global economy, if there was ever a time to join the dots between responding to the health emergency and the climate and nature emergency then this is it,” said Sauven. “The worst case would be that you haven’t used this awful crisis to reorientate the economy to achieve a much better outcome for people and the environment globally.”\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

But it has to also stop investing in Shell and BP,” she said.\n“These investments cannot be justified on ethical, environmental or financial grounds, and they undermine MPs’ credibility in addressing the climate emergency.

Dealing with both is going to require extraordinary focus and resolution.\nAlready there is a whiff of political opportunism in the air. Last week, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said that the €1tn European Green Deal, unveiled and enshrined in law by the European commission barely three weeks ago, should be put to one side. Member states, he advised, should concentrate all resources on combating a pandemic which, one by one, is shutting down societies and economies. Along with other eastern European states such as Poland, the Czech government has been reluctant to acknowledge the scale of action required to combat global heating, which would have a severe impact on fossil fuel industries in their countries.\nAdvertisement\nThe extreme urgency of defeating Covid-19 scarcely needs stating. But Mr Babiš’s broader suggestion has been rightly rejected. “This is one of the very reasons why we presented the climate change law: to avoid that climate action, a generational task, is obfuscated by more pressing and immediate challenges,” said a Brussels spokesman. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch commissioner who is leading the EU response on the climate emergency, has made the same point.\nThe new climate law commits member states to zero emissions by 2050. A stringent new target is also to be set for 2030, which will be enshrined in the law.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMr Timmermans has said that the climate law will act as a ‘“compass” for the next 30 years as EU member states seek sustainable forms of growth. In these extraordinary times, local imagination and creativity in developing a sustainable future will be at a premium. There are at least some hopeful signs that such thinking is taking place.\nIn the city of Utrecht, plans have been unveiled for the largest purpose-built pedestrianised residential area in Europe, which will attempt to harness the virtues of the sharing economy. The Merwede estate will house 12,000 people on a 60-acre site. Transport will be provided by bus and train networks and a shared pool of bikes and cars – one car for every three families. Schools, shops, sports and medical services will all be within walking distance, and water from the local canal will be used to heat the area. The intention is for the district to become close to energy neutral.\nUtrecht is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Netherlands and is projected to add 100,000 people to its 350,000 population by 2040. In terms of factoring in a necessary environmental dimension to new construction, Merwede looks like best practice. It is the kind of project that is relatively small scale, but repeatable. It helps of course that the Dutch have a historically passionate relationship with the bicycle. But as the EU attempts to hold the line on implementing its green deal, many more Utrechts will be required.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps.\nIn the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been stubbornly stuck on natural gas for much of the country.\nAcross the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle.\nAdvertisement\nThat has made some individuals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, produced a decisive yes.\nScientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO2 saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating.\nThey found that in 53 out of 59 regions, comprising 95% of the world, electric vehicles and domestic heat pumps generate less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered cars or boilers. The only exceptions are heavily coal-dependent countries such as Poland.\nHow green are electric cars?\nRead more\nIn countries such as Sweden, which gets most of its electricity from renewable sources, and France, which is largely powered by nuclear, the CO2 savings from using electric cars reach as high as 70% over their conventional counterparts.\nIn the UK, the savings are about 30%. However, that is likely to improve further as electric vehicles grow even more efficient and more CO2 is taken out of the electricity generating system.\nHeat pumps use electricity and heat exchange systems – similar in principle to those found in fridges – to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany’s emissions today.\n“The idea that electric vehicles or heat pumps could increase emissions is essentially a myth,” said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. “We’ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.”\nJean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: “The answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.”\nAmong the detractors has been Bjørn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were “simply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet”.\nMike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Electric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it’s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.”\nBut he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits.\n“Where the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the necessary rapid rollout of electric cars and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,” he said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”\nMonks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.\n“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe World Health Organization describes NO2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.\nOne of the largest drops in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to Nasa, nitrogen dioxide levels across eastern and central China have been 10-30% lower than normal.\nAdvertisement\nNO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.\nThe country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.\nThe changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hotspots.\nSince the country went into lockdown on 9 March, NO2 levels in Milan and other parts of northern Italy have fallen by about 40%. “It’s quite unprecedented,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Service. “In the past, we have seen big variations for a day or so because of weather. But no signal on emissions that has lasted so long.”\nThe source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.\nAdvertisement\nPeuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.\nAlthough the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London.\nRoad traffic accounts for about 80% of nitrogen oxide emissions in the UK, according to Monk. For the average diesel car, each kilometre not driven avoids 52 milligrammes of the pollutant entering the air.\n“What I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

The migratory butterfly flew in from Africa via continental Europe in greater numbers than in any summer apart from 2009 and 1996.\nOn the verge: a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers\nRead more\nProf Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation said the encouraging results “provide evidence that the overall rate of decline of butterflies is slowing and for some species being reversed”.\nHe said conservation through agri-environment schemes, increased woodland cover, climate warming and “increases in grazing levels by wild animals and a slowing in the rate of agricultural intensification” had all played their part.\nDr Marc Botham of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology said two warm summers in succession, which allowed population numbers to build up over a longer period, had also contributed to the boom year.\n“In addition to record numbers of spring species such as orange-tip and brimstone, it was also encouraging to see annual increases in garden favourites such as peacock and small tortoiseshell, both of which have had some poor years recently,” he said.\nSome species, however, are struggling to adapt to rapid climatic changes. The rare heath fritillary saw its annual abundance drop by 34%. Its numbers have fallen by 91% over the long term as a result of climate change and a loss of traditional coppicing in woodlands and grazing on moorland.\nThe figures show that targeted conservation work is helping many rarer species, including the chequered skipper, up by 175% on 2018, and the Duke of Burgundy, which a decade ago was threatened with extinction but recorded its eighth best year since 1976. Other species benefiting from habitat management include the marsh fritillary, silver-studded blue and silver-spotted skipper, none of which are now in long-term population decline.\n“We’re really heartened to see a shift in the fortunes of many of our most loved species,” Brereton said. “The long-term situation for butterflies in general does remain a cause of concern though, with more species declining than increasing since the 1970s.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Scientists have said the world’s oceans are gathering heat due to accumulating levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mostly from burning fossil fuels.\nCorals bleach if they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Survival from bleaching depends on how high and for how long temperatures get. Some species of corals have higher tolerance for heat than others.\nObservations of conditions on the reef from satellites and in-water temperature loggers suggest central and southern parts have accumulated high levels of hat stress.\nBut the authority said the full picture would only come clear once the aerial surveys were completed at the end of this week, and the data had been analysed.\nIn 2016 and 2017, the world heritage reef experienced back to-back bleaching that was intense enough to kill almost half the reef’s corals over those two years.\nCentral and southern parts of the reef were not severely impacted in those years, meaning they are not used to the heat stress and could be harder hit.\nProf Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, spent 17 hours across four days in the air last week scoring bleaching on reefs with a staff member from the authority.\nGreat Barrier Reef on brink of third major coral bleaching in five years, scientists warn\nRead more\nAfter completing the first four of nine days of aerial surveys, Hughes told Guardian Australia most of the severe bleaching had been seen at coastal reefs.\nOn Friday, flying from Lockhart River to Cairns, Hughes said corals at Princess Charlotte Bay at the bottom of the Cape York Peninsula had been severely bleached, but the impacts were much less on reefs further away from the coast.\nMany of the outer reefs in the north – known as “ribbon reefs” because of their slim and snaking appearance from above – had escaped bleaching.\nHughes said: “A lot of the reefs we have been looking at were badly affected in 2016 and 2017. They don’t have a lot of corals on them and the corals that are there have managed to survive 2016 and 2017, and so they are tough.”\nHughes said it “remains to be seen what will happen in the south” but there were more coral species in those areas – including staghorn and table acroporas – that would be more susceptible to bleaching.\nSome of those central and southern reefs “have accumulated a lot of heat, particularly near the coast,” he said. “This is shaping up to be strongly coastal – 2016 and 2017 were cooler in the south and, this time around, it is not cool in the south.”\nHughes said: “Even if it turns out to be a relative moderate event event compared to 16 and 17, it is still cumulative and because the footprints are different, the cumulative amounts of the reef that’s affected severely or moderately will go up.”\nTownsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government’s Coral Reef Watch program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the agency’s analysis showed how localised the heat stress had been. But whether that heat stress had translated to severe bleaching would be be answered by the aerial surveys.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHe said according to his agency’s analysis, one area of Swains Reefs off Townsville had showed some of the highest levels of heat stress across the entire reef, but some of the lowest levels had also been in the same group.\nThis was one reason, he said, why the aerial surveys were important. He held concerns for the corals in southern areas.\nHe said: “Let’s cross our fingers that the corals were not as susceptible as they were in the past.”\nWachenfeld told Guardian Australia that whatever the final assessment was “these are still significant events that are sounding a very loud alarm bell about what’s happening to the reef in the face of climate change.”\nHe said there had been reports of “at least moderate bleaching” from Magnetic Island, near Townsville, and Heron Island, off Gladstone.\n“Bleaching does not necessarily mean death and that some people do misunderstand that,” he said. “Yes, the reef is in trouble, but what that means is that it needs more help.”\nGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\n(@gbrmarinepark)\nAerial surveys this week of the Ribbon Reefs, above Cairns, show little to no bleaching. Aerial surveys continue over the coming days in areas that experienced more heat stress. #GreatBarrierReef #video pic.twitter.com/4cdjpbj4ZE\nMarch 20, 2020\nAdvertisement\nWachenfeld said whatever the final detailed assessment of the severity of this summer’s bleaching revealed, this needed to be seen in the context of the broader challenges the reef was facing, including the ongoing impacts from climate change.\nHe said 2016 and 2017 were “the worst events that have ever happened” for the reef, and so if this year turned out to be less severe, this should “not lull us into a false sense of security”.\nHe said he was encouraged to hear that outer ribbon reefs in the north – which he had personally dived on many times – had seemingly escaped bleaching this summer.\n“They are some of the most beautiful places on the planet and so to know they have done well in this event gives me enormous hope for the future and of what we have left to protect,” he said.\n“There are still places that are absolutely amazing. The reef as a whole is still a gobsmackingly amazing and beautiful place and it needs us to do more globally to protect it.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Britain will have no choice, he says, but to engage with the commercial sector in large-scale planting of imported conifers, despite fears of the impact on habitats and wildlife.\nSuch a move risks incurring public anger, if its 20th-century precursor is anything to go by. “People felt it was bad for landscape, biodiversity and amenity,” said Healey. “Both the public and conservation professionals saw many negative effects on heathland; there was the notorious draining of the peat bogs of the Flow Country in the far north of Scotland; some really important habitats were left decimated by tree planting.”\nCarbon benefits of fast-growing trees have been clearly proven | Letters\nRead more\nIn 2017 the UK was the second largest net importer of forest products, behind China. Yet only 1,420 hectares of woodland were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government’s target of 5,000 hectares. Wales and Northern Ireland planted 520 hectares and 240 hectares respectively.\nThe Committee on Climate Change has called for the planting of more trees and woodlands if the UK is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It recommends increasing UK woodland cover from its current low level of 13% of total land cover to at least 17%, and possibly to 19% by 2050. In contrast, 38% of the average EU member state is wooded, a roughly similar percentage to the US.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFarnham Heath nature reserve, where conifer plantations were removed to restore open heathland. Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian\nThe Conservatives have pledged to plant 30 million trees a year between 2020 and 2025. But Healey said such targets faced stiff challenges. Indigenous species grow too slowly to be an efficient option for rapid carbon fixation, he said. Unharvested woodland eventually stops sequestering carbon when it reaches maturity.\nAdvertisement\nBut conifer forests are harvested for timber, allowing new trees to be planted. He said: “The trees that produce this commercial timber and can grow in this country are virtually all non-native and are predominantly conifers from North America.”\nThe need to plant more trees is now an urgent priority to tackle the climate emergency. Mature tropical forests in Africa and the Amazon are slowing their rate of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere and may soon become a source of emissions, as trees die.\nHealey said it was time to be pragmatic. “Many people think we can have this huge expansion of tree planting in the UK and it will all happen without costing us as the taxpayer that much money. We also think it will all be nice, native species woodland of broadleaved trees and lots of biodiversity but it’s just economically impossible.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“People and politicians have got to face up to the fact that the vast majority of this tree planting, if it’s to occur at the scale they have talked about, is going to have to come from commercial investments, and forest and environmental policy has got to avoid getting in the way of that unnecessarily,” Healey said. “Planting is catastrophically slow in England and Wales, and many commercial investors feel that they are held back from acquiring land and converting it to woodland because of the way that the whole raft of environmental and other policy regulations are implemented.”\nMany endangered species – such as curlews and lapwings – depend on open habitats like moors and heaths.\n“Everyone agrees that the best of these habitats should be protected,” Healey said. “But a lot of them are in really poor condition. Is restoration the best use of all this land, or should some, instead, be converted to conifer plantations or native woodlands? We need to ask how much of our heathland we need to protect or restore and how much we can convert to rapid carbon sequestration.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A third of healthcare facilities in developing countries also lack access to clean water on site.\nWater wars: early warning tool uses climate data to predict conflict hotspots\nRead more\n“It’s really obvious that in Africa and parts of Asia we should be very fearful of what is to come,” he said. “The coronavirus crisis highlights how vulnerable the world is.”\nThe UN World Water Development report, published on Sunday, pointed to the underfunding of water infrastructure around the world, despite its importance.\nRichard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told the Observer that water was often overlooked for spending and investment because the economic benefits of better water and sanitation were not emphasised. The coronavirus crisis sheds new light on those mistakes.\n“One of the reasons underlying the investment gap in water and sanitation is that these services are perceived mainly as a social - and in some cases environmental - issue, rather than an economic one, like energy,” he said. “Yet the economic costs of an outbreak [such as Covid-19] are enormous, both in terms of national economies and stock markets, as well as in terms of household revenue - when people cannot work because of sickness or lockdowns. Realising the economic importance of water and sanitation should provide an additional catalyst for greater investment.”\nAnother reason for the neglect of water and sanitation is that people are generally willing to pay for the water coming into their homes, but not for transporting and treating afterwards. “Once it is flushed down the toilet, it disappears and becomes someone else’s problem,” said Connor. “Treating wastewater is several times more expensive than treating the source water in the first place. So without a willingness to pay on the part of users, it falls on governments to foot the bill, and since they do not recognise the economic value of wastewater treatment – which is perceived as more of an environmental issue - the political will behind such spending is low.”\nYet improving access to water and sanitation has clear benefits – in the coronavirus crisis, and beyond. Connor quotes evidence that suggests that the return on investment in water and sanitation can be high, with a global average benefit–cost ratio of 5.5 for improved sanitation and 2.0 for improved drinking water, when broader macroeconomic benefits are taken into account.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWater use has increased sixfold in the past century and is rising by about 1% a year owing to rising populations and increasing demand, while climate breakdown means that more areas of the world will see stress on their water supplies, including regions where supplies were previously abundant, such as many parts of Europe, Asia and north America.\nOne possible source for renewed investment in water is through a better understanding of the links between water issues and water infrastructure and the climate crisis, the UN report suggests.\nWhile trillions in investment have been poured into reducing greenhouse gas emissions around the world in the last decade, through clean energy and low-carbon technology, few resources have been devoted to the water supply. This year’s UN water report has found that opportunities are being missed to use water projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions while improving access to clean water.\nSewage treatment is a clear example: wastewater gives rise to between 3% and 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally, more than flying. Processing sewage can turn wastewater from a source of carbon to a source of clean energy, if the methane is captured and used in place of natural gas. Currently, between 80% and 90% of wastewater around the world is discharged to the environment with no treatment.\nFarming methods can also be adapted to use water more efficiently and cut carbon at the same time, because when soils are better managed they hold more organic matter, more carbon and more water – rendering them more fertile as well as sequestering greenhouse gases.\nThat makes investing in water a “win-win-win”, in terms of improving people’s lives, generating economic growth and helping to cut carbon, the report found.\nYet of the hundreds of billions in climate finance devoted to developing countries in recent years, projects involving water made up less than 1% in 2016, the latest year for which full figures were available, according to the report.\n“Water does not need to be a problem – it can be part of the solution [to the climate crisis],” said Audrey Azoulay, director-general of Unesco. “Water can support efforts to both [reduce greenhouse gases] and adapt to climate change.”\nWainwright said the key ingredient for success in fixing the world’s water problems, alongside funding, was improving governance and how water supplies are managed.\n“Water needs good governance,” he said. “That is usually what is missing. The world is not running out of water, but there is water stress. There is competition for water resources, but making sure that the people who need water get it is a good investment.”\nTopics\nWater\nClimate change\nUnited Nations\nRivers\nAccess to water\nOceans\nnews\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on Pinterest\nReuse this content"},{"title":"Book clinic: are there any novels about the climate crisis?","paragraph":"Q: Can you recommend some climate crisis fiction? The nonfiction is too depressing and fiction often helps the heart cope with the world\nPeggy Duesenberry, 61, Massachusetts, US\nA: Melissa Harrison is a novelist and nature writer whose books include At Hawthorn Time and All Among the Barley. She writes:\nThere are plenty of dystopian cli-fi novels out there, designed to jolt us out of our current complacency – but it doesn’t sound as though that’s what you need. The American poet and climate activist Kate Schapira believes we must “imagine – and learn about! there are precedents! – the structures that would allow us to live well enough without hurting ourselves and each other, and without helping the people currently hurting us”.\nAdvertisement\nFiction can help us do that imaginative work.\nThe brilliant Jenny Offill’s new novel Weather is a great place to start, as it explores what it’s like for ordinary people to move from fear and denial to concrete action. Emily St John Mandel’s haunting Station Eleven (2014) takes us into a near future where disease has led to a breakdown of society, but not a world devoid of hope, for Shakespeare’s plays survive, and art and love remain central to the human experience. Set in an Australia ravaged by climate change, Alexis Wright’s richly strange, genre-bending The Swan Book (2016) is a reminder that other, older cultures may have healthier and more connected relationships to the natural world than the destructive western capitalism currently in the ascendant. Since writing The Dispossessed (1975), Ursula K Le Guin has concluded that an “anarchist utopia” such as the one she describes would eventually destroy itself – but as a way of envisioning a society organised on different principles to ours, it continues to inspire.\nFinally, Tove Jansson’s gorgeous, sparklingly simple The Summer Book (1972), in which a little girl and her grandmother spend a season on a Finnish island, has two vital lessons for today: how to live a rich, creative life with very few resources, and how to remain clear-eyed and full of courage in the face of grief and loss.\nThe work we need to do now is as much moral and imaginative as it is practical.

If we are to stand any chance of meeting this target, known as “net zero”, there is one enormous challenge that we will have to tackle: home heating.\nWarming our homes is responsible for between a quarter and a third of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. That’s more than 10 times the amount of CO2 created by the aviation industry. Around 85% of homes now use gas-fired central heating, and a large proportion of gas cooking still takes place. Greening this system is a huge challenge by any measure. But if recent reports are to be believed, there could be a simple and efficient way to do it: change from using natural gas to hydrogen gas.\nHydrogen is abundant in the natural world and according to its advocates could power the next generation of gas appliances cleanly and efficiently.\n“The attraction of hydrogen is that for a lot of consumers, they wouldn’t notice any difference. Customers would continue to use a boiler to heat their homes in a similar manner to natural gas,” says Robert Sansom of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s energy policy panel. He is the lead author on a study conducted by the institute called Transitioning to Hydrogen.\nTogether with colleagues, Sansom assessed the engineering risks and uncertainties associated with swapping our gas network to hydrogen. Their conclusion is that there is no reason why repurposing the gas network to hydrogen cannot be achieved.\nZero-carbon hydrogen injected into gas grid for first time in groundbreaking UK trial\nRead more\nThat’s not to say it would be easy, though. Technological and practical hurdles exist because there is no blueprint for such a conversion: there is nowhere in the world that supplies pure hydrogen to homes and businesses. The UK would have to pioneer everything.\nInterest in hydrogen as a way to heat homes began in 2016 with a report called H21. It was conducted by Northern Gas Networks, the gas distributor for the north of England, and looked at whether it was technically possible and economically viable to convert Leeds to 100% hydrogen instead of natural gas.\n“They went into a lot of detail, from the hydrogen production plants right the way down to people’s homes,” says Sansom.\nThe report drew a parallel to the way the gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas in the 1960s and 70s. Town gas was a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. It was mostly produced from the distillation of coal and oil and had been used for the first 150 years of the UK’s gas industry. With the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, which is predominantly methane, the UK undertook a nationwide programme to convert 40m appliances over a decade.\nWhole streets would be converted at a time. Engineers would inspect the gas appliances, and then convert them. Simultaneously, the town gas was disconnected and the pipelines were purged with an inert gas. Finally, the natural gas was pumped into the system and the engineers would make sure each appliance worked correctly before moving to the next street along.\nSome manufacturers are now so convinced that a similar thing can happen with hydrogen that they have already begun to develop new household appliances. In February, Worcester Bosch unveiled the prototype of its hydrogen-ready boiler. It would run first on natural gas and then, after a servicing visit, hydrogen.\nAlso working in hydrogen’s favour is that for the past 20 years, the gas industry has been systematically replacing the metal pipes in its “iron mains” network with yellow polyethylene ones. Around 90% of the pipes will have been replaced by 2030. This is good news for hydrogen because the gas reacts with the old metal pipes, making them brittle. But the polyethylene is safe.\n“Effectively we started a programme of hydrogen-proofing our gas network without knowing we were doing it,” says Sansom, who found himself becoming more and more impressed by the concept. “From a personal point of view, I was very much on the fence when I kicked off with this work. But I found myself slipping down on the hydrogen side in terms of its viability as a low carbon alternative to natural gas,” he says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWorcester Bosch’s hydrogen-fired boiler. Photograph: Worcester Bosch\nAdvertisement\nBut not everyone is convinced by this sudden interest in hydrogen. Richard Lowes of the University of Exeter Energy Policy Group says that until recently the received wisdom had been that heating would have to be electrified in some way to meet our climate-crisis commitments. “That has basically come out of years and years of technical and economic modelling to look at how you get to fully decarbonised heating in the UK,” says Lowes.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nSwitching heating from gas to electricity would mean relying on heat pumps. These use electricity to extract heat from either the air or the ground. In the case of an air source heat pump, it works like a fridge but instead of sucking heat out of a food compartment, it pulls it out of the air and channels it into the home, where it is used to heat water, which is piped to radiators for central heating, and stored in a tank for hot water.\nBut because this technology works at a lower temperature than existing boilers, it requires many homes to be much better insulated, or to have larger radiators, capable of delivering more heating power. For those who have switched to heat-as-you-go combi boilers, it will necessitate the reinstallation of a hot water tank.\nIt’s extensive work but worth it, according to Lowes, who has removed his own gas boiler and is now using an air source heat pump to heat his home. “It was a lot of work but my home and heating system are now a lot more efficient. It’s always warm, there’s always hot water and it’s basically the same cost to run as gas,” he says.\nIt's a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can’t dig up the roads when they’ve been doing it for 20 years\nRichard Lowes\nThe third approach is called district heating. It envisages water being heated at a central facility using waste heat from industry or green sources such as solar power. The hot water is then delivered to many homes simultaneously through a network of heavily insulated underground pipes. Both methods can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of home heating but the downside is that they require extensive work to roll them out on a national scale.\nDistrict heating would require water pipes to be laid under homes, and the widespread use of heat pumps would necessitate the National Grid’s electricity circuits being upgraded. It is this kind of disruption that hydrogen’s advocates say could be avoided because much of the national infrastructure has already been upgraded. That argument cuts no ice with Lowes. “It seems a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can’t dig up the roads when they’ve been doing it for the past 20 years,” he says.\nHe points out that although the consumer may not experience so much disruption, significant challenges for the gas industry remain. For example, the National Transmission System, which is the network of pipes that supplies gas from the coastal terminals to the gas distribution companies and other major users, is made of metal. This would need to be protected from embrittlement in some way before any switch to hydrogen could take place.\nAdvertisement\n“Hydrogen is certainly not a silver bullet,” says Lowes. And if we get distracted by it, we could be getting ourselves into more trouble, missing the 2050 energy target altogether.\nBut if there is so much uncertainty with hydrogen, why is the gas industry, which funds many of the studies, pushing it so hard? According to Chris Goodall, energy economist and author of What We Need to Do Now for a Zero Carbon Future, it is a matter of survival.\n“They do not wish for their industry to be eaten up by a switch to electricity for heating. So they are moving as fast as they can to persuade us about hydrogen,” he says. And it all comes down to how the gas is produced.\nHydrogen is not found on Earth in a pure state. Instead, it has to be extracted from other substances, and the best one to extract it from is methane – in other words natural gas. Hence, the gas companies could effectively keep their current operations running.\nBut the extra steps involved in extracting the hydrogen would push the price up. Additionally, the extraction creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so large scale carbon capture technology would need to be developed to prevent it escaping into the atmosphere. Although this is a technology that the UK will have to develop anyway in order to reach net zero by 2050, it will add to the cost.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nNorthern Ireland’s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January. Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA\nBut natural gas is not the only substance that contains hydrogen. Water does too, and the hydrogen can be freed by a process called electrolysis, which doesn’t create any carbon dioxide. To make it totally green, which is the ultimate hope, electrolysis could be powered by wind farms. At the moment, however, the price of such electricity is expensive, and that would push the price of hydrogen up still further.\nAdvertisement\nGoodall hopes that the cost will decrease as technology improves, but warns: “You can be accused of mindless optimism just by saying this.”\nThe UK’s future energy landscape is without doubt a difficult realm to navigate. Perhaps the best route will be revealed by not pitting the various solutions against one another. “All three have strengths and weaknesses and I expect that there’ll be a major role for each as a replacement for natural gas,” says Sansom. Even hydrogen’s detractors acknowledge this. “As a niche technology it can have real value,” says Lowes. He goes on to paraphrase the Heineken lager adverts of the 70s and 80s, saying that hydrogen could potentially reach the parts of the country that other energy solutions can’t.\nGoodall also sees a role for hydrogen to “store” energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power. The idea is that in windy months, any extra electricity generated from renewables will be used to make hydrogen, which would then be stored. When there is extra demand on the National Grid, or a seasonal drop in the power produced from renewables, the hydrogen can be burned to produce electricity.\nThe truth is that all options for us to decarbonise our heating systems will require significant disruption and cost. And while government continues to deliberate, the clock ticks towards 2050.\n“There is no need to wait. We can deploy stuff now that works fine,” says Lowes, referring to his own experience of changing his gas boiler for a heat pump. “The urgency of climate change means there really isn’t any reason to delay.”\nOthers believe that there is a role for hydrogen and think it is worth taking a little more time to consider. But there is one truth that everyone agrees upon. “None of this is easy. If anyone is saying to you this is easy, they are misleading you,” says Lowes.\nHydrogen-powered cars\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters\nAdvertisement\nHydrogen can also power vehicles, but in a different way than it would heat houses. Instead of being burned, the hydrogen reacts with oxygen inside a device called a fuel cell. Electricity and water are produced. The electricity runs the car, the water drips from the exhaust pipe.\nAn attempt to switch to hydrogen vehicles in the 1990s was thwarted byelectric cars, which store their energy in an onboard battery. But a new push for hydrogen vehicles is coming from Asia. China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious goals to have millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by 2030.\nToyota and Hyundai are both offering hydrogen vehicles in the UK, but there are currently less than 20 hydrogen filling stations across the UK, mostly clustered around the M25.\n“It will be really interesting to see what happens,” says Lowes. But he himself is not convinced: “Hydrogen is much more expensive than electricity, and the car is more expensive than the electric vehicle.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A spell of hot weather can always be compared to a similar spell of hot weather from way back in the past. Similarly a big storm, intense rain and flooding often have parallels from long ago. Now a study in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that the signs of climate change are harder to spot in mid-latitude countries such as the UK and US, and easier to see in the tropics.\nEd Hawkins, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared global mean temperature fluctuations with local temperature fluctuations for different parts of the world. They show that while the global average temperature has wiggled smoothly upwards, a mid-latitude location such as Oxford in the UK has always had wild swings in temperature. “Climate change impacts in some countries are being hidden by their own changeable weather,” writes Hawkins. By contrast increasing temperatures in tropical regions are more obvious because the background climate is steadier in these regions.\nWhen it comes to rainfall, the data reveals a clear signal of increasing extremes, masked in mean rainfall plots.

One swarm recently reported in Kenya covered an area the size of Luxembourg.\nThe organisation has requested $140m (£120m) to help fight the ongoing breeding of the insects, predicting that a continuation through late March and April could see the existing number of locusts grow by 400 times by June.\nThe current crisis is considered the worst in decades, and there are fears it could last longer than previous locust outbreaks.\nAlongside the climate emergency impact, the war in Yemen is a key factor.\nCressman said Yemen is a “frontline” country for locusts, with the insects typically present throughout the year. But its once effective locust programme no longer has the same impact in cities where control is now divided between the government and Houthi rebels.\nThe head of the locust programme, Adel al-Shaibani, is based in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana’a.\n“Before the war we had a good ability to reach anywhere in Yemen,” he said. “In current times we’re just able to cover the Red Sea coastal areas – but not all – and some areas in the interior.”\nHe explained that there were two separate locust control centres in Yemen but neither was able to combat the outbreak effectively alone.\nThe Sana’a-based centre carried out control operations wherever they could in 2018, but they have been underfunded and have lost some of their vehicles.\n“In spite of all our hard efforts, some areas remained out of control due to security reasons near the border with Saudi Arabia. The desert locust outbreak occurred and some swarms formed and moved to other areas,” said Shaibani.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA young desert locust without wings is seen on a stalk near Geerisa town, in Somaliland’s Lughaya district. Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA\nBy late 2019, the locusts had moved into the Horn of Africa, finding favourable conditions when an unseasonaal cyclone hit Somalia in December. This extended breeding time and allowed them to spread to areas authorities could not control because of the country’s security problems.\n“This crisis could be quite long because of the Yemeni and Somali areas that cannot control the populations,” said Cyril Piou, an expert with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development.\nAdvertisement\nHe said that in previous decades locust outbreaks had only lasted roughly two years but, without preventive systems, they will last longer, happen more frequently and spread further.\n“We are all linked in some way, what is happening somewhere else affects us all,” he said.\nScientists turn to tech to prevent second wave of locusts in east Africa\nRead more\nThe last comparable locust outbreak was in the late 1940s and 50s, but Cressman said that was in a time when monitoring and reporting was a slow, cumbersome process and chemical pesticides were readily available for control operations.\nHistorically, the Arabian Gulf has very few cyclones. But the past decade has brought a significant increase thanks to the Indian Ocean dipole, a phenomenon linked to flooding in the western Indian Ocean, dry weather in the east and wildfires in Australia.\nCressman, part of whose job involves looking at historical conditions to understand current developments, said the climate’s behavioural changes made that difficult.\n“This analogous forecasting methodology used to work pretty good up until five years ago, and it’s just not working very well any more at all because of the rainfall, the timing, the distribution.

Her records show why, 70 years later, her son is now one of a fast-growing band of increasingly successful – and award-winning – Swedish winemakers.\n“It’s really quite clear,” said Hansson, 68, a former financier who planted his first vines on the south-facing slopes of what is now the Hällåkra vineyard in 2003, and today has about 22,000 on 6.5 hectares.\n“We have an extra month of summer now. And winters are not like what they used to be. That’s why we can make wine, and why 50 years ago, we couldn’t.”\nSeptember, Hansson said, used to be the month when temperatures would plummet, but not any more: “Now we’re seeing daytime temperatures of 24 or 25C, even at the end of the month, with perfect, cool nights. Impossible when I was a kid, and not very different from Burgundy.”\nEven a decade ago, few would have bet on Scandinavia becoming a serious producer of quality wine. But while temperatures of up to 48C grilled grapes on the vine in some traditional wine-making areas of southern Europe last summer – costing some French growers up to 80% of their crop – global heating is incubating a whole new industry in the Nordic region.\nDenmark now has about 90 commercial vineyards, compared with two in 2005, while Sweden has 50. A handful of bold pioneers are growing grapes in Finland, and the world’s most northerly functioning vineyard overlooks Norway’s largest fjord.\nThey are, of course, infinitesimally small beer compared with the more established winemakers of southern and central Europe: according to Sveneric Svensson of the Swedish Wine Association, Sweden has barely 125 hectares of land under vine, against an estimated EU total – mostly in France, Italy and Spain – of 3.3m.\nOutput is tiny: Sweden produced less than 450,000 litres of wine in 2019; France alone made more than 4.5bn. “We are still very much in our infancy,” Svensson said. “But commercial production is now serious. And the quality of the wine is very encouraging. There’s excellent feedback, from around the world.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nMurre Sofrakis at Flädie vineyard, near Mälmo.

Photograph: Marie Hald/The Guardian\nScandinavia’s combination of longer daylight hours – up to 25 hours a week in high summer – and lower temperatures make for white and sparkling wines with “a really fresh, crisp acidity that is becoming harder and harder to achieve further south in Europe”, Svensson said, where increasingly fierce summer highs greatly increase the sugar content in the ripening grapes.\nAdvertisement\nEarly Scandinavian wine pioneers searched long for varieties that would suit this nascent Nordic terroir, and had to learn on the job how to turn them into something drinkable, said Murre Sofrakis, who first planted an experimental half-hectare of vines in his father’s market garden in Klagshamn, just outside Malmö, in 2001.\n“Growing is one thing, but producing something decent is very much another,” Sofrakis said in the small but spotless winery of the Flädie vineyard, where – on top of the two hectares of his own that he now has under vine at Klagshamn – he looks after a further three for the estate’s owner.\nThe grape variety most Swedish winemakers have settled on is solaris, a hardy hybrid developed from riesling and pinot gris, for their whites. Created in 1975 in Freiburg in southern Germany, the variety is “particularly suited to Scandinavian conditions”, Sofrakis said. “It just really seems to like it here. It’s our insurance policy: even in a bad year, it will make a good wine.”\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates\nRead more\nThe most common variety for reds is rondo, created in 1964 in the former Czechoslovakia by cross-breeding St Laurent, a classic grape more usually seen in the European Alps – although several growers, including Hansson, have now also begun successfully producing pinot noir.\n“Up here, it’s a constant and necessary process of trial and error,” Hansson said. “Each year, we try something new in a small part of the vineyard. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. We now know, for example, that merlot isn’t possible here. Very nice leaves, totally lousy grapes.”\nOne advantage that Scandinavia’s neophyte winemakers have over southern European producers is that their more recently developed grape varieties, grown in a cooler climate make for markedly more disease-resistant vines.\n“The wine industry, as a whole, uses a lot of chemicals,” said Sofrakis. “It’s common practice in France, for example, to spray your vines between 14 and 18 times. Here, I haven’t sprayed once in 18 years.”\nHansson, along with several Swedish winemakers, now sells to top restaurants in Sweden as well as exporting to sommeliers and specialist wine merchants in cities such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. But it has not always been easy. In the early days, he said, finding a customer was as hard as producing a good wine.\nGrowing is one thing, but producing something decent is very much another\n“Wine drinkers here were used to a big, classic, southern European flavour profile, which we obviously didn’t match,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nBut 15 years on, said Mick Daly, an Australian former engineer who now works with Hansson, the fact that the wine “is local, the product of a terroir, of our specific climate and conditions in Skåne … it used to be a negative; it’s now a positive. We’re no longer just a novelty. People who used to take a glass now take a bottle.”\nCracking the Swedish retail market was doubly hard because low production volumes mean prices are necessarily high – typically €25-30 (£23-28) a bottle – and, unlike in Denmark, only the state-run monopoly, Systembolaget, is allowed to sell alcohol in Sweden. Winemakers cannot sell their product on-site or by mail order.\nBut as the quality of Swedish wines has improved, more official stores have begun selling them. “The quality is really getting there,” said Joel, an assistant manager at Systembolaget’s central Malmö outlet, which now offers a dozen different Swedish white, sparkling, red and dessert wines. “There’s quite a buzz.”\nAt Bloom in the Park, his Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking the lake in the city’s Pildammarna park, Igi Vidal said he was “proud to introduce diners to Swedish wines as objectively fine as these”. Of the five glasses Vidal serves blind with his chef’s much-lauded five-course tasting menu, at least two will be Swedish.\n“Some early vintages,” he confesses, “I wouldn’t have brushed my teeth with. But over the last five years or so, the quality has soared. People who really know something about wine are gobsmacked. You give them a glass, they love it, then you tell them where it comes from they say, ‘You’re kidding. That’s from Sweden?’”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHåkan Hansson at Hällåkra. ‘It’s not just an advantage. It’s a challenge, too. We will need to be very good growers.’ Photograph: Marie Hald/The Guardian\nVidal has a special fondness for the wines produced by Göran Amnegård of the Blaxsta estate near Stockholm, whose dessert ice wine – hailed as “glorious … a golden treasure” by the wine critic Jancis Robinson – first put Swedish wine on the map in 2007 when it collected a raft of international awards.\n“The guy’s a genius,” Vidal said, appreciatively nursing a glass of Amnegård’s 2016 chardonnay. “Who would have thought someone would ever produce something like this in Sweden? Round, creamy, golden … Comparable with some of the world’s best.”\nScientists say the world’s wine map could be fundamentally changed by global heating, with traditional winemaking regions in southern Europe, as well as Australia, California and Latin America, becoming simply too hot while more northerly areas such as the UK, the Netherlands and Scandinavia boom.\nAdvertisement\nThat does not mean northern vineyards will find life easy. Rising temperatures may have improved growing conditions, but global heating also means more extreme and unpredictable weather: heavy rain, violent storms and hail. “It’s not just an advantage,” said Hansson. “It’s a challenge, too. We will need to be very good growers.”\nThe challenges in southern Europe, however, look daunting. In Spain and Italy, winemakers are moving to higher altitudes and planting on north-facing slopes to prevent record temperatures ripening grapes too fast, boosting their sugar and alcohol content to unacceptable levels and irreversibly altering their flavour.\nIn France, scientists at the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin in Bordeaux are exploring how more heat- and drought-resistant grape varieties from countries such as Georgia, Portugal and Tunisia fare in south-west France against traditional Bordeaux varieties such as merlot, which is thought to be unlikely to survive the coming decades.\nFaced with global heating, producers in the chateaux of the Bordeaux region are hampered by strict rules governing how their wine must be made if it is to qualify for the Bordeaux appellation: irrigation is not allowed and a true Bordeaux wine can be made from just six authorised grape varieties.\nAs irrigation is not seen as a sustainable option, producers voted unanimously last July to experiment with allowing up to 10% of seven new grape types – including two from Portugal – in the final blend of certain Bordeaux categories in a historic effort to combat the effects of climate change while retaining the wine’s key characteristics.\nNordic growers, meanwhile, see mostly upside to the changes ahead. “Serious money” was now being invested in Swedish vineyards, Sofrakis said, the largest of which now have up to 20 hectares under vine. What was once a retirement hobby has become a career option: ambitious young Swedes are studying winemaking in France and California before returning to work in the industry at home.\n“There’s a critical mass now, a momentum,” he said. “We have the conditions to produce quality wines; there aren’t many places in the world like this. We’re winning prizes – and we’re still learning. I reckon it’s a 30-year curve: 10 years to indulge your passion, 10 to gain experience, 10 to professionalise. I’m very confident.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Last year was the hottest on record for the Arctic, with the annual minimum extent of sea ice in the region its second-lowest on record.\nAntarctica logs hottest temperature on record with a reading of 18.3C\nRead more\nUnlike the retreat of sea ice, the loss of land-based glaciers directly causes the seas to rise, imperiling coastal cities and towns around the world. Scientists have calculated that Greenland’s enormous ice sheet lost an average of 268bn tons of ice between 2002 and 2019 – less than half of what was shed last summer. By contrast, Los Angeles county, which has more than 10 million residents, consumes 1bn tons of water a year.\n“We knew this past summer had been particularly warm in Greenland, melting every corner of the ice sheet, but the numbers are enormous,” said Isabella Velicogna, a professor of Earth system science at University of California Irvine and lead author of the new study, which drew upon measurements taken by Nasa’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellite mission and its upgraded successor, Grace Follow-On.\nAdvertisement\nGlaciers are melting away around the world due to global heating caused by the human-induced climate crisis. Ice is reflective of sunlight so as it retreats the dark surfaces underneath absorb yet more heat, causing a further acceleration in melting.\nIce is being lost from Greenland seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, scientists revealed last year, pushing up previous estimates of global sea level rise and putting 400 million people at risk of flooding every year by the end of the century.\nMore recent research has found that Antarctica, the largest ice sheet on Earth, is also losing mass at a galloping rate, although the latest University of California and Nasa works reveals a nuanced picture.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“In Antarctica, the mass loss in the west proceeds unabated, which is very bad news for sea level rise,” Velicogna said. “But we also observe a mass gain in the Atlantic sector of east Antarctica caused by an increase in snowfall, which helps mitigate the enormous increase in mass loss that we’ve seen in the last two decades in other parts of the continent.”\nThe research has further illustrated the existential dangers posed by runaway global heating, even as the world’s attention is gripped by the coronavirus crisis. Crucial climate talks are set to be held later this year in Glasgow, although the wave of cancellations triggered by the virus has threatened to undermine this diplomatic effort.\n“The technical brilliance involved in weighing the ice sheets using satellites in space is just amazing,” said Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University who was not involved in the study.\n“It is easy for us to be distracted by fluctuations, so the highly reliable long data sets from Grace and other sensors are important in clarifying what is really going on, showing us both the big signal and the wiggles that help us understand the processes that contribute to the big signal.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Travel bans and the shutdown imposed in many countries because of the virus have resulted in cancelled meetings and officials working remotely.\nLord Stern believes any move to postpone the talks would put paid to any hope of making real progress. “At the moment we must just get on with the preparation,” he said. “This is such an urgent challenge and there is so much to do, and so much valuable work that is being done, that we can’t afford to lose the momentum.”\nAt Cop26 – the 26th conference of the parties – countries are supposed to come up with more stringent plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, because current plans under the Paris agreement are inadequate. The UK was hoping to bring many countries to the table with pledges to hit net zero carbon by 2050, a target that the UK has already enshrined in law.\nStern said work had become more difficult because of the virus, but not impossible. Postponing the summit now would effectively put the brakes on at a time when acceleration is needed, he said, and if needs be then a postponement could be discussed after the summer, depending on the situation then.\nStern is backed by other former high-ranking diplomats. Yvo de Boer, a former chief of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony, said it was vital to keep working towards a November Cop26. “If it is going to be cancelled, that should only be done at the last possible minute – in October,” he said.\nOne former high-ranking official who helped put together the Paris agreement said: “Cancelling now might look like the UK was grasping too soon for a way out of an important meeting.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nNicholas Stern: ‘We can’t afford to lose the momentum.’ Photograph: Jonathan Nicholson/Getty Images\nSome NGOs and developing country experts also view talk of postponement as counterproductive. Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa and a close observer of the talks for many years, said: “We would rather not see it cancelled until we know more about the spread of the virus. Cancelling it immediately might mean action on climate change gets ignored this year and people on the frontlines in poorer countries can’t afford that.”\nAdvertisement\nJanine Felson, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “We cannot afford to lose any momentum. We should all focus our energies on ensuring that we can support each other through this trying time and continue to push for ambition.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBut some experts contacted by the Guardian believe postponing the talks would provide more time for diplomacy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has written to Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of Cop26, urging him to delay.\nHe said: “Postponement is very different to cancellation. It would be the same president, the same venue, the same two countries co-hosting, so all you are doing is having a slight delay. The UK got off to a slow start [in launching its strategy for hosting Cop26] so postponement would give more time for the work that is needed.”\nOne key issue is that the US presidential election is due to take place a week before Cop26 begins. Donald Trump is strongly opposed to the Paris agreement and his withdrawal from it will take effect the day after the election. A new president, if there is one, could be more amenable to climate action but would not take office until January, so a postponement could allow the US to participate.\nPaul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: “One distinct advantage of delay until spring 2021 is the growing prospect that US voters will turn Trump’s climate nihilism out of office in favour of Joe Biden’s robust climate ambition, infusing global negotiations with far greater importance and momentum.”\nSome pre-Cop meetings are already in doubt. The UNFCCC has cancelled all meetings for the next month but a decision will have to be taken soon on an intermediate meeting set for Bonn in June. Italy is due to co-host Cop26 with the UK but its plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe UK government has said there are no plans for a change. A spokesperson said: “We continue to work towards hosting the event in Glasgow in November, which is eight months away. Given this is an evolving situation we are keeping the situation under careful review.”\nThe UNFCCC also said there was no immediate move to postpone the talks. Any decision would have to be taken by the Cop Bureau, made up of elected representatives from various countries, and would also involve the Chilean government, which technically will preside over the process until the UK officially takes on the presidency in November.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

But we have the tools to recover","paragraph":"E\nurope has become the global centre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. In France, where I am writing from, President Macron has put the country in a “health war” lockdown. Cafes, restaurants, theatres, public parks are closed and all non-essential activities have stopped. In living memory there’s never been anything like this: under Nazi occupation, as we know, Paris culture and nightlife kept functioning rather well. Covid-19 is upon us now, and many of our continent’s large cities feel like they’re fast sliding into one of those dystopian movie scripts with empty streets, face masks, surgical gloves and self-isolation the new normal.\nWith hospital emergency units bracing themselves for much worse yet to come, it feels almost irrelevant to dwell on what this moment says about our place in the world as Europeans, or which feelings we are able to muster – or not – for one another and for others overseas. Postwar Europe’s institutional set-up was meant to epitomise international cooperation and solidarity, and to set a form of global example in the process. Will any of that survive now as countries start to wall themselves in? And what can we citizens do about it?\nPostwar Europe’s institutional set-up was meant to epitomise international solidarity. Will any of that survive now?\nAfter Donald Trump signalled last week that the US wanted to de facto seal itself off from Europe, I remembered an oped by two of his senior team members published in 2017. “The world is not a ‘global community’, but an arena where nations ... compete for advantage,” they’d written. With Covid-19, that “arena” is put into even sharper focus. And nationalist reflexes are hardly a Trumpian monopoly these days. (Reports that Trump offered a German biopharmaceutical company a fat sum of money to secure a vaccine exclusively for the US only added to a general go-it-alone picture.)\nThere isn’t much official coordination or sticking-together on display in Europe itself. National governments, including Germany’s, have sealed their national borders to neighbouring states or are increasing controls. The rationale for much of this can be mind-boggling. Borders don’t stop the virus. Some of what’s at work is that rightwing populist credos have in recent years infected entire swaths of our continent’s politics. For them, there is only one single measure of collective self-identification and solidarity: the ethno-national level. Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, to take an example, lost no time holding “foreigners” responsible for the pandemic.\nAs events spiralled and with the death count mounting, I wondered about empathy and solidarity: what triggers them? What does a pandemic crisis say about our capacity for such feelings and modes of action? And could grassroots, citizens’ initiatives possibly course-correct some of the egoism of states?\nIn his book Ordinary Virtues, Michael Ignatieff quotes a speech Eleanor Roosevelt gave at the United Nations in 1958. She was speaking about human rights conventions, but the gist of her text can apply to the notion of human solidarity at large. “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person ... Without concerted citizen action … we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.”\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates\nRead more\nBeing the global centre of the pandemic means we in Europe hold a specific responsibility in the way we react to this situation, and in how we behave also towards others beyond our shores. Perhaps it helps to think a bit about how we approached the climate crisis as a collective cause for mobilisation (think of the Paris climate agreement). Why couldn’t we now clearly identify Covid-19 as another danger that needs to be addressed collectively – and take up the task as citizens to make that message loud and clear? However different, both these perils have this in common: they transcend all national boundaries and they threaten lives. The “us” versus “them” logic of nationalists and populists becomes absurd in the face of these phenomena.\nSo here’s a question. While governments scramble, is it too early to think of launching a Europe-wide citizens’ online campaign for solidarity in the age of the coronavirus? Could people create a movement that says, let’s help each other as much as we can, and in ways that cut across the national divides many of our governments are resorting to?\nVideos of Italians in lockdown singing from their balconies to keep their spirits up have been admirable. Could some of that gusto spread and morph into a Europe-wide flurry of videos chanting our empathy and willingness to show solidarity with one another? Wherever we may live and whatever language we may speak, sending that kind of message across our “Corona-centre” continent would hold special meaning, surely not just for ourselves now, but for others also, and perhaps for the future as well.\nTo be sure, for the moment we are stunned by the shock of what’s unfolding and bewildered by what is yet heading our way. Also, still too many people seem confused or in a form of denial as to the exact extent of what we’re facing. Until just days ago, some people in Paris thought best to keep partying, or to attend crowded public protests. Likewise in Ireland, videos of people celebrating in packed bars last weekend have caused outrage.\nTrust in institutions and resistance to fake news are being put to the test. Pessimists will say our European capacity to come together and show generosity, or even elementary openness to others, has already been entirely blunted by the crises of the past decade (our numbness to Syria’s killing fields is, to me, the greatest case in point). We are no doubt now in severe, introspective, fear-and-fragmentation European mode.\nBut for those who still believe we can be a community of a kind, and that our continental space (or the world beyond) should not be turned into an “arena”, now is the time to ask ourselves how we will want to look back at this phase of our collective history. How will we want future generations to look back at us, and what kind of message do we want to send to the rest of the world? And please note, with every mention of Europe I include the UK. We are one continent, and the virus is among us all. Discord or “social distancing” among nation-states makes no sense in the face of an invisible enemy in our midst which makes no distinction about its victims.\nEurope's populists will try to exploit coronavirus. We can stop them\nCatherine Fieschi\nRead more\nAnd look around: ordinary virtues aren’t absent at all. Gestures of empathy and solidarity are multiplying at a local level – medical students volunteering to help hospitals, or neighbours helping the elderly get food. Why not invent something symbolically similar at a wider, transnational level, and by making use of digital tools? Politicians have done little of this. But citizens can show the way.\nArtists, creators, start-ups, activists, anyone or any network that’s part of the fabric that binds us together in beautiful, meaningful ways under ordinary circumstances, could take a stand for cross-border solidarity in these extraordinary circumstances. Scientists and medics are of course sharing and coming together. Why not extend that to other parts of our societies? It’s obvious that our only chance to somehow mitigate this catastrophe is to act together, or at least to act in ways that are closely attentive to others, not blind or negligent towards them.\nMany of us are now hunkering down at home, and it’s all but natural that we focus on immediate day-to-day needs, the health of loved ones, saving our work or our livelihoods, in our entirely up-ended lives. But if our claims to human empathy have any meaning at all, then now is a good time to think of building up a pan-European chorus of voices for solidarity. Sure, it won’t in itself bring us any closer to a vaccine, nor immunise us against the virus, but it could help immunise us against something else – the nasty undercurrents of nationalism that are lurking under the surface. As we Europeans stand at the epicentre of it all, it’s up to us to make solidarity viral.\n• Natalie Nougayrede is a Guardian columnist\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Last year, the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas, according to the figures.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nA group of influential shareholders are now urging the bank to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies, and have filed a resolution to be voted on at Barclays’ AGM in May.\nFracking has been the focus of intense business activity by investment banks since the Paris agreement, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America leading £241.53bn of financing, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion led financing for tar sands crude oil projects in Alberta, north-west Canada, which have caused widespread damage to ecosystems.\nThe big-four Chinese banks have dominated financing for coal mining and coal power since the Paris agreement and have no policies restricting business practices.\nKirsch said: “This makes it crystal clear that banks are failing miserably when it comes to responding to the urgency of the climate crisis. As the toll of death and destruction from unprecedented floods, droughts, fires and storms grows, it is unconscionable and outrageous for banks to be approving new loans and raising capital for the companies that are pushing hardest to increase carbon emissions.”\nAhead of the next major international climate talks, Cop26 in Glasgow this November, the UK government has sought to make the business and the banking sector the focus of tacking the climate crisis. The former head of the Bank of England Mark Carney has been appointed as a climate envoy, warning that businesses must improve how they disclose their impact on the environment or risk failing to meet climate targets.\nJohan Frijns, director of BankTrack, an NGO which monitors the activities of major financial institutions, said it was time for banks to commit to phasing out financing for all new fossil fuel projects.\n“In the last year, banks have been queueing up to proclaim support for the goals of the Paris agreement. Both the Principles for Responsible Banking and the new Equator Principles, each signed by over a hundred banks, acknowledges the global climate goals. Yet the data in Banking on Climate Change 2020 show these laudable pledges making little difference, and bank financing for the fossil fuel industry continuing to lead us to the climate abyss,” he said.\n“It is high time banks recognised that reaching the Paris climate goals requires an immediate end to finance for all new fossil fuel projects, and a rapid phase-out of existing fossil finance. This should be the Global Glasgow Goal for all banks.”\nJPMorgan Chase said the commitments it announced last month “reflect our ongoing efforts to help address climate change and promote more sustainable development”.\nIt added: “This includes financing to support climate action and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, backing market-based policy solutions to reduce carbon emissions, expanding restrictions on financing for coal mining and coal-fired power, and prohibiting project financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic.”\nThe bank looked forward, it said, to growing “its impact over time”.\nA Barclays spokesperson said: “We are working hard to help tackle climate change including facilitating £34.8bn of social and environmental financing last year. We continue to engage with ShareAction and other stakeholders on how we can make further progress.”\nWells Fargo told the Guardian that it believes that climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and is committing to a low-carbon economy. The bank said it is working to measure and report on the carbon intensity of its credit portfolio.\nA Bank of America spokesperson said they recognise their role in managing climate risk and in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nCitigroup did not respond when contacted by the Guardian for comment.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They can grow at an extraordinary rate, up to 2ft in a day, and absorb huge amounts of carbon – globally, kelp forests absorb an estimated 600m tonnes of carbon each year, about twice the UK’s annual carbon emissions. And as the kelp die, their carbon is stored in sediments on seabeds.\nA magnificent kelp forest once stretched about 25 miles (40km) along the West Sussex coast and 2.5 miles (4km) out to sea, from Selsey to Brighton. The kelp provided habitat, nursery and feeding grounds for wildlife ranging from seahorses, cuttlefish, lobster and fish. But the forest has almost disappeared as trawler nets ripped the kelp from the sea bed and sediments were dumped from dredging. A campaign is restoring the kelp forest and an agreement has been reached to ban trawler fishing across about 115 sq miles (300 sq km) off the coast.

The complaint also calls on the government to axe all overseas financial support for fossil fuels.\nThe complaint argues that the UK’s foreign credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), has breached the OECD’s guidelines for multinational enterprises by failing to take the climate crisis into account.\nAnger over World Bank's $55m pledge to Guyana's fossil fuel industry\nRead more\nAdam McGibbon, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said the government’s funding of fossil fuel projects overseas “continues to show this government to be climate hypocrites”.\nUKEF is tasked with supporting British exports with credit, guarantees, loans and insurance for foreign ventures including manufacturing, transport infrastructure, hospitals and energy projects.\nHowever, UKEF’s financial support for overseas fossil fuel projects has grown by billions of pounds in recent years despite rising calls for governments, investors and companies to end their contribution to the climate crisis.\nUKEF offered financial support worth £2bn to overseas fossil fuel projects in 2018, more than 10 times as much as the year before, when it gave only £175m.\nOne of UKEF’s largest energy deals in 2018 included £734m in support of the Duqm oil refinery project in Oman. It also provided financing worth £248m for oil exploration in Brazil, £171m for an oil refinery in Kuwait, and several hundred million for power projects in Iraq.\n“Global Witness is today taking a stand against the government’s rank hypocrisy by taking this case to the OECD – every penny spent overseas by the UK must take into account its impact on the climate. No bluster or rhetoric can hide the fact that spending billions on climate-wrecking projects abroad is not climate leadership,” the campaign group said.\nAlthough the OECD is not able to demand action from multinational enterprises, any expression of disapproval would add to growing calls for UKEF to end its support for fossil fuels.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nLast year a parliamentary committee of MPs accused the government of sabotaging its climate credentials by paying out “unacceptably high” fossil fuel subsidies to developing nations, while claiming to lead the world in tackling the climate crisis.\nThe environmental audit committee said that UKEF spent £2.6bn in recent years to support the UK’s global energy exports, of which £2.5bn was handed to fossil fuel projects and only about £104m was used to support renewable energy projects.\nGlobal Witness has called on UKEF to disclose the carbon footprint of its portfolio by revealing the emissions produced by the projects it helps to finance. Global Witness has also called for the agency to set emissions targets for its portfolio to bring its investments in line with the Paris agreement.\n“UKEF has no goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its finance activities, nor does it fully disclose or report all such emissions that occur because of these activities,” said the complaint.\nA government spokesperson said UKEF would consider its response to the complaint.\n“UKEF is an export credit agency in the form of a UK government department, and follows the relevant OECD rules,” the spokesperson said. “UKEF does not consider itself a ‘multinational enterprise’ under the OECD definition.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

There were just 154 submissions in 2016, rising to 185 in 2017.\nThe consultancy said there was a growing appetite among energy companies for new renewable projects to help cut carbon emissions and reach the UK’s climate goals.\nClean energy developers are also able to roll out more projects due to falling technology costs and greater support from financiers, who view renewable energy as a lucrative investment.\nWind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world, analysis finds\nRead more\nGeoff Holmes, the chief executive of PX Group, said: “It goes without saying that as more of these projects get off the ground, the faster the UK can get to a point where clean, green sources provide an even greater share of the UK’s energy.\n“Of course, there is a lag time between submitting plans to councils and projects becoming fully operational, so more projects being in the pipeline is not a quick fix.”\nPlanning submissions for clean energy projects are expected to rise in the years ahead due to the government’s decision earlier this month to lift a block against subsidising onshore wind projects that was put in place almost five years ago.\nFrom next year, onshore wind developers will be allowed to compete for subsidies at auction alongside solar power developments and floating offshore wind projects, the government said last month.\nThere has been a sharp decline in the number of new onshore windfarms since the block was put in place by David Cameron in 2016. The rollout of new onshore wind capacity fell to its lowest level since 2015 last year, prompting warnings that the UK risked missing its climate targets.\nUnder the new plans, windfarm developers will need to comply with tough new proposals on community consent to qualify for the auction process, and projects planned for England will also need the consent of the local community through existing planning codes.\nSome renewable energy developers, including Scottish Power, began plans for a big expansion of onshore windfarm projects in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects.\nThe chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson, said the decision to back onshore wind was “one of the first clear signs that the government really means business” on reaching its climate targets.\nEarlier this week, the global energy watchdog warned that governments will need to use climate policies and economic stimulus packages to support the ongoing rollout of clean energy despite the global economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak and a crash in oil market prices.\nFatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, said governments “should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition”.\n“These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments. But the good news is that, compared to economic stimulus packages of the past, we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition,” he said.\n“If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Cognac can only be made in one 78,000-hectare area of France, using grapes grown in six regions, or crus. This means distillers cannot move production to another part of the country to escape rising temperatures.\nThe spirit is, broadly, made from wine that is distilled into a liquid called eau-de-vie and aged in oak casks, often for decades. The result is cognac, with Hennessy, Martell, Courvoisier and Rémy Martin among the best known brands.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nVines damaged and without leaves in a vineyard in Cognac following a violent storm in the region during 2018. Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP via Getty Images\nThese brands, and many more, are now working to find sustainable solutions to manage the effects of climate change. Extreme and unpredictable weather has blighted the region: in 2018, powerful hailstorms caused serious damage to 3,500 hectares of vineyards in the Cognac area. Hail and heavy rain also reduced the 2016 harvest, while 2017 was marred by frost.\n“There is more extreme weather in Cognac than there used to be,” said Patrick Raguenaud, president of the BNIC, the governing body of Cognac. “We would sometimes have hail, but not this big.”\nThe changing climate has also thrown out the timings of production. “The grapes are ripening much sooner than they used to,” said Baptiste Loiseau, cellar master at Rémy Martin. “What is key is the balance between sugar and acidity. In cognac we need a lot of acidity to maintain the conservation of the wine because we are not using sulphur.”\nWinegrowers have shifted harvest dates forward, and Cognac’s grapes are now removed from their vines in September rather than October. However, this raises concerns that other key flavour characteristics risk being lost. “When we harvest early, we are able to have a correct level of acidity and … sugar,” said Pierre Boyer, deputy cellar master and estate manager at Hine. “But the problem is we are going to have less aromatic components in the grapes.”\nAdvertisement\nCognac houses and their partner winegrowers are seeking longer-term solutions. According to Loiseau, while Ugni blanc has been the best grape variety for Cognac for more than a century, this may not be the case in the coming decades. “We have to prepare the future for the next generation, to allow them to take the right decisions depending on the conditions of weather,” he said.\nA number of estates across the region, overseen by the BNIC, are testing grape varieties that are not currently permitted under the AOC to see if they prove more resilient to global warming and resistant to disease.\nRémy Martin is working with the Monbadon cultivar and, five years ago, planted vines in test sites. After two harvests, Loiseau notes that the grape’s ripeness develops at a slower pace than the Ugni blanc vines, which have been planted in an adjacent plot.\n“The role of the trial is to have these two plots and see how they behave year after year, vintage after vintage,” said Loiseau.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCognac makers are engineering completely new varieties of grapes that are more resistant to disease and extreme weather conditions.

The ads call for the public to support Steggall’s climate act, making the appeal that “what happens next is up to you”.\nZali Steggall on getting to zero net emissions – Australian politics live podcast\nThe campaign is being funded by community climate change groups, donors of the Climate Act Now campaign and pro-bono assistance, with more than 120 “Climate Act Now” advertisements set to appear across the country this month.\nSteggall is hoping to garner bipartisan support for a national climate change framework bill aimed at transitioning Australia to a decarbonised economy that is based on the UK’s Climate Change Act, passed in 2008.\nThe bill would put in place national plans for climate change adaption and enshrine a net-zero emissions target by 2050 to be reviewed every five years by a newly established independent climate change commission.\nSteggall has been arguing that the framework legislation would take the politics out of the climate change policy debate, while putting in place an effective process for national targets, actions and reporting.\nShe has been lobbying both Labor and government MPs to allow a conscience vote on the legislation, and has already locked in the support of the crossbench in the lower house.\nOn Monday, four digital billboards will be in place in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, followed by a rotating poster advertisement campaign across the Sydney CBD and North Sydney, and in Melbourne.\nSteggall said the campaign was designed to keep the legislation in the public eye, and said there was strong support coming from North Sydney and Wentworth, where moderate Liberal MPs are under pressure to do more on climate change.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“After such a horrific summer, this advertising campaign is there to remind Australians that the country needs a sensible approach to climate change,” Steggall said.\n“We have received enormous support from our neighbouring electorates of Wentworth and North Sydney who want their local federal members to vote for the bill.”\nSo far more than 73,000 Australians have supported the climate change bill through the “Climate Act Now” website.\nWhile the bill will be introduced when parliament next sits on 23 March, there is a risk that it will be left to languish on the notice paper without government support.\nIf the government refuses to allow debate on the bill in the House of Representatives after it is introduced, Centre Alliance, which is co-sponsoring the legislation, could introduce it into the Senate later in the year.\nThis would force Labor to declare its hand on the bill, which has so far failed to land a position, saying it will never come to a vote in the lower house.\n“For Zali Steggall’s bill to be considered, Scott Morrison would need to allow a full debate in the parliament,” the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said last month.\nEssential poll: a majority of Coalition voters support a net zero emissions target for 2050\nRead more\nAs part of the campaign, B-Corp – a group that certifies businesses for making positive decisions on the community and the environment – will support the bill , backed by 16 of B-corp’s 300 registered companies.\nAdvertisement\nCommunity groups in Wentworth and North Sydney have also funded particular advertising within their electorate.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

PensionBee is believed to be one of the fund’s top five owners, with more than £60m invested.\nJP Morgan to withdraw support for some fossil fuels\nRead more\n“It is clear that there is increasingly strong demand for pension products that give customers the choice to divest from oil,” PensionBee said.\nWhile the full stock list for the new fossil fuel-free fund has not yet been confirmed, it will exclude oil companies and take a wider ethical stance by barring investments in tobacco, weapons makers and pure coal manufacturers.\nEmma Douglas, the head of defined contribution at LGIM, said: “Based on our funds in our Future World range, the new fund will be driven by long-term thematic analysis, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations and active ownership, which means engaging to bring about real, positive change in the companies we invest in.”\nLGIM, which has more than £1tn in assets, said the fund will be open to corporate pension schemes and individuals.\nThe investment firm has defended holding Shell in its Future World range of funds. Those funds are governed by its climate impact pledge, meaning it is willing to exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as for lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis.\nLGIM has said it needs to balance environmental and financial concerns when putting together the investment portfolio, previously noting that Shell is one of the largest payers of dividends in the UK.\nAdvertisement\nIts climate pledge has led LGIM to dump stakes in China Construction Bank, Rosneft Oil, Japan Post Holdings, Subaru, Loblaw and Sysco Corporation in 2018.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nLast year, it cut a further five stocks from the ethical funds, including the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer MetLife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) last year.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nHowever, a Guardian analysis last year also found LGIM as a whole had spent about $367m (£285m) between January and November, increasing its stake in those companies in other parts of the business, even when accounting for the divestments.\nLGIM openly admits it continues to hold stakes in companies excluded from those environmentally and socially focused funds, saying it gives them the opportunity to engage with the board and ultimately influence company behaviour.\nCommenting on the launch of the fossil fuel-free fund, PensionBee said: “We hope this is just the start of all savers using their investments to transform the world they live in – for the better of the planet, society and their retirement.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The flaring, which she says collapses night into day, can be seen more than 20 miles away in Edinburgh.\nErskine, a local Labour councillor, describes living in Lochgelly, a former mining community neighbouring Mossmorran, as unpleasant. “When that flare goes, the house does vibrate. For me it’s something akin to a Nimrod [maritime patrol plane] landing on top of your house. The first time I went out to see if there’s a helicopter flying overhead.”\nResidents, who formed a local action group, are calling on the government to set up an independent inquiry into the health, social, and environmental impact of what they describe as an “ageing” plant, but this demand has been ignored. For the local community, the flaring has come to symbolise a disconnect from the Scottish government’s rhetoric about the climate emergency and what it does on the ground.\nTime for the oil industry to snuff out its flares\nRead more\nExxonMobil’s Fife Ethylene Plant at Mossmorran began production in 1985. Flaring, a process that burns off gas that cannot be processed, can last for several days. As well as planned flaring events, unexpected flaring also occurs as a safety mechanism. It’s legal on the site that ExxonMobil shares with Shell Fife NGL, but the company has a duty to mitigate the impact it can have on local communities.\nLast April, the Scottish environmental agency (Sepa) launched a criminal investigation into ExxonMobil because of unplanned flaring. The investigation follows “final warning letters” issued to ExxonMobil in April 2018 regarding flaring that was found to be “preventable and unacceptable”.\n“In our bedroom, which faces towards Mossmorran, it’s impossible to keep the light out. It’s a nightmare,” said Joe Purves, a 69-year-old recently retired accountant who has lived in Lochgelly for 45 years. He believes the frequency and severity of the flaring has got worse over the last few years.\nAdvertisement\n“The community are told when there’s going to be planned flaring, but it’s the fact the emergency flaring keeps on taking place,” said Linda Holt, an independent councillor at Fife council. “They always say it’s ‘process upset’ but everyone knows it’s because something has gone wrong. And things have gone wrong more in the last few years because the plant is ageing.”\nLast summer, the plant was shut down to address the mechanical issues the company was having with its boilers and implement preventive work to improve the plant’s reliability. But unexpected elevated flaring occurred within a month of the plant reopening in February, sparking widespread anger.\nChris Dailly, Sepa’s head of environmental performance, said the watchdog had made it clear ExxonMobil needed to invest further in flaring mitigation technologies and given the company a timeline for compliance. “We’ve been clear that flaring has been unacceptable and that compliance with Scotland’s environmental rules is non-negotiable,” he said.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWhile 42-year-old James Glen, a graphic and web designer who set up the Mossmorran action group in 2017 with Holt, welcomes Sepa’s investigation, he argues it’s not enough. The action group calls for an independent inquiry that looks at health, site safety, and social issues. More than 2,000 people have written to the Scottish environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, echoing the action’s group demand.\nA spokesperson for the Scottish government said that as Sepa was concluding its investigation, it “would not be appropriate nor helpful for ministers to interfere in independent regulatory decisions, particularly while enforcement investigations are ongoing”.\nGlen accuses the Scottish government of “hiding behind Sepa” and said it should come to meet the community to discuss their concerns. Erskine said Holyrood is already losing credibility on the issue. “We should be looking after our constituents, not big business. Our job is the safety and wellbeing of the people that live here. If that plant had been any place near Edinburgh, it would have been shut down.”\nGlen says the community’s concerns about their health had long been dismissed until a 2019 NHS Fife report, which he believes just scratches at the surface, concluded “it is clear that the degree of physical and psychological disturbance caused to people in the vicinity of Mossmorran has been considerable”.\nThe report noted the most common health-related concerns among local residents were anxiety, respiratory issues such as asthma, sleeping difficulties, and headaches. It found no evidence of higher than expected cancer rates, while 32 Sepa’s air quality reports demonstrate no breach of the UK air quality standard.\nStuart Neill, the plant’s public affairs manager, said: “We very much regret any concern that flaring may have caused to members of the local community. The safety of our people and neighbours is our most important priority and the ability to flare is a critical part of the plant’s multiple safety mechanisms.”\nNeill added that the plant is one of the youngest facilities of its kind in Europe and as well as investing £20m annually in maintenance, this year the company would be investing an additional £140m to upgrade infrastructure to improve operational reliability and reduce flaring.\nGlen set up an impact map so residents can report health, social or environmental issues related to Mossmorran. There have been 363 incidents added so far. One report from a resident in Edinburgh notes: “I genuinely thought tonight that there had been an explosion at the plant given the intensity [of the flaring].” Another writes: “If we see it as far away as North Berwick what must it be like up close?”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It may be home to sand lizards and stoats, adders and orchids, butterflies and bush-crickets, water voles, peregrine falcons, or great crested grebes.\nYet often these oases are not official nature reserves, but little scraps of land we rarely consider important for nature. Churchyards, roadside verges, railway cuttings and disused quarries may not appear to have much in common. But they were all originally created for humans’ needs, before becoming places where wild creatures thrive. Together, they add up to an area larger than all our official nature reserves combined.\nNot that these spots are unimportant to people. Often on the edge of urban areas, they are accessible to more people than rural nature reserves – especially to those who, by an accident of birth, background or geography, do not have access to “real” countryside.\nAdvertisement\nThese places also matter for another, even more urgent reason. Since the second world war, a continuous drive towards more intensive farming has turned much of our countryside into a wildlife-free zone.\nThat’s where the sites featured in this book come in. They provide a much-needed refuge for otherwise scarce species. Without them, some of our most vulnerable wild creatures would already have disappeared.\nI don’t need to tell you that Britain’s wildlife is under threat. Loss of habitat, pollution, persecution and, above all, the global climate emergency, mean that even our once common and widespread species are now struggling.\nSo, at the start of this make-or-break century, as our wildlife enters one of the most challenging periods in its history, I have travelled round the country to visit these unheralded sanctuaries. Without them, nature in modern Britain might not be able to survive at all.\nReclaimed docks, Belfast\nMy taxi driver looked puzzled. ‘No, fella – there’s nothing down there except an industrial estate. I’ve never even heard of the “Window on Wildlife”!’ Fortunately, Google Maps came to our aid, and we headed through the rush-hour traffic towards Belfast docks.\nTwenty minutes later, we arrived outside “WoW” – the RSPB’s Window on Wildlife. The first thing that struck me was the strident calls of black-headed gulls, floating en masse over the lagoon before drifting down to land on artificial nesting rafts. They were accompanied by more delicate, wraith-like birds – common and Arctic terns – and dozens of black-tailed godwits, feeding voraciously.\nAdvertisement\nDuring the 1960s, when the port was being regularly dredged to permit the passage of large ships, the mud was dumped into three large pools. The plan was that eventually the mud would settle, and the land could then be reclaimed for building. But nature had other ideas. The fertile combination of water and mud created the ideal habitat for waterbirds such as ducks and waders, and they came here to feed in their thousands.\nGradually, it became clear that the area was a real hotspot for birds: not just migrants and winter visitors, but breeding species too. Local people began lobbying to save this precious place from development. After long negotiations with the port authorities, the middle of the three lagoons was set aside for wildlife.\nBack at the visitor centre I had a chat with two regular volunteers, Ken and Phyllis. Ken reflected on the irony that somewhere that looks so natural is entirely created by humans, while Phyllis had noticed that, as the nearby industrial estate and business park grows, more and more workers are dropping in, lured by the sign outside.\nBelfast WoW is, to be honest, a bit out of the way to attract casual passers-by, as my taxi driver confirmed. But that’s all the more reason why places like this need championing. Phyllis told me she loves the reaction from visitors when they enter the observation area for the first time. ‘They just say, “Wow!”’\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAdders are found at Canvey Wick nature reserve. Photograph: Alamy\nBrownfield Reserve at Canvey Wick, Essex\nThe southern migrant hawker is one of the most attractive of all our two dozen dragonfly species, and not only because it is so rare. The male is a dazzling cerulean shade, each azure segment interspersed with jet black. Close up, through my zoom lens, I could see the pale blue eyes and the lattice-like wings, laced with tiny shards of gold.\nAdvertisement\nThis was just one of the amazing insects I saw on a recent visit to Canvey Wick, Britain’s first “brownfield” nature reserve. It is also home to a plethora of birds such as the whitethroat and stonechat as well as reptiles including adders and common lizards. In the early 1970s, this site was earmarked for an oil refinery, but the oil crisis led to the cancellation of the entire project. Afterwards, it was simply allowed to return to the wild.\nHad someone wanted to design a nature reserve for insects, they could hardly have done better – yet Canvey Wick is perhaps the most genuinely accidental habitat in this book. The poor, sandy soils only allow vegetation to grow slowly, so the wildflowers and grasses are not swamped as they might be elsewhere. And the large, circular stands of asphalt where the oil tanks would have stood built retain heat, creating a microclimate ideal for continental, warmth-loving species such as the shrill carder bee. Then there is the location: Canvey Island is one of the sunniest, warmest and driest places in the whole of the UK.\nCanvey Wick has been described as “England’s rainforest”, but as the Guardian’s wildlife writer Patrick Barkham pointed out, “England’s savannah” is a better description, given the absence of large trees. Like so many other wildlife-rich sites I have visited, it is a mosaic of mini-habitats: birch and willow scrub, brambles, dry and damp reedbeds, long grass and earth banks, which between them create exactly the right mix of ecological niches.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nCanvey Wick may not look special, but for invertebrate life it rivals well-known nature reserves such as Minsmere, Wicken Fen and Dungeness. As ecologist Dr Sarah Henshall notes, its unusual history gives it a special place in our natural heritage: “Canvey Wick is wild, it’s different, it’s rough around the edges. Wildlife thrives in the untidy messiness – that’s what makes the site unique.”\nI am reminded of my childhood, when I played for hours in places like this. Canvey Wick is the clearest possible evidence why the label “brownfield site” is so unhelpful – indeed positively detrimental. To those who care about Britain’s wildlife, it’s these messy corners that need to be prioritised, not the green swathes of agri-desert that make up so much of our lowland countryside.\nGravel pits and reservoirs around London\nIn May 1974, I cycled from my home to the village of Datchet, where the Queen Mother Reservoir was being built. I walked slowly through the heat-haze towards a distant strip of water, where a slim bird took off a few yards in front of me, giving a persistent, high-pitched whistle I now know was a sign of alarm.\nI lifted my binoculars to see a small, long-winged wader circling low over the gravel. When it landed, I could see the plain, brownish back, black mask and, most importantly, a thin, lemon-yellow eye-ring: my first ever little ringed plover.\nAdvertisement\nThis was a classic example of a species adapting to an “analogue habitat”. On the continent, little ringed plovers nest on the shingle banks of rivers, swept clean of vegetation by winter floods. The bare shingle allows them to disguise their eggs, especially from aerial predators such as kestrels. Gravel pits and reservoirs provided an ideal substitute for riverbanks, and during the post-war years they allowed the little ringed plover to gain a foothold this side of the Channel.\nAbout this time, I came across Adventure Lit Their Star, by Kenneth Allsop. The name will be familiar to readers of a certain age, for Allsop was a familiar face on TV during the 1960s. This was a Boys’ Own adventure story, in which an airman recovering from tuberculosis joins forces with two young lads to foil attempts by an egg-collector to steal a precious clutch of little ringed plovers’ eggs. The message is that birds need to be protected and welcomed and, more importantly, that nature can offer a form of therapy. This was something Allsop, who had lost a leg in the war and suffered periodic bouts of depression, understood only too well.\nLittle ringed plovers went against expectations to breed in what Allsop described as “the messy limbo that is neither town nor country”. As a definition of the Accidental Countryside, this could hardly be bettered.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGreen sandpipers are a mid-summer visitor to Somerset. Photograph: Saverio Gatto/Alamy\nPeat diggings, Somerset\nIt took me five minutes to walk round. At the edge of the peat diggings a few miles from Glastonbury I saw 10 birds, of just four species. And yet, apart from the five loitering mallards, the others confirmed these changing times.\nAdvertisement\nThe first bird was a little egret. I am old enough to remember when one of these impossibly white birds made any birding trip a red-letter day. Even now, I still feel a jolt of pleasure whenever I see this little heron, which when I was growing up was still confined to the area around the Mediterranean.\nMoments later I saw a buzzard, another bird that wouldn’t have been here 20 years ago. Whereas the little egret extended its range northwards thanks to climate change and habitat restoration, the buzzard benefitted from an end to persecution by gamekeepers, enabling it to recolonise its former haunts.\nThe next bird was one of my favourites: the green sandpiper. I half expected to see it here on this warm, early-August evening, as they drop in to feed on their journey south to Africa. For me, they are the first sign of autumn, despite appearing at the height of summer.\nThe final pair of birds would once have been a very rare sight here. But there are now several dozen great white egrets on the Somerset Levels, and recently they have begun to visit my local patch.\nBirds like the great white, little and cattle egrets (another recent colonist), give the lie to the idea that all our wildlife is in decline. It’s not, but it wouldn’t take much to destroy these temporary, liminal habitats on which so many wild creatures depend.\nBefore I left, I heard the piping call of that lone green sandpiper, and watched it rise into the sky. As it disappeared, I wished it good luck. It would need it, for just as places like this are being destroyed, so its stop-over points are also under threat, from wetlands being drained, or drying up because of climate change.\nOne day, I fear, I will watch one disappear over the horizon, and that will be the last time I ever see a green sandpiper; not just here, but anywhere.

If, as many environmentalists say, the struggle against global heating requires a sense of wartime emergency, then fighting it while chiefly relying on these assets is as if Britain fought the Second World War relying on the Home Guard.\nLast week’s budget contained some useful steps to limit carbon emissions; but they are far too small, and offset by road construction and the failure to lift the freeze on fuel taxes brought in 10 years ago.\nClimate change, if unchecked, threatens the destruction of Britain; yet the new money allocated to combat it is less than one fifteenth of the annual defence bill and well under half the cost of the two Royal Navy aircraft carriers – which increasingly seem to have no national strategic purpose.\nThe best way of looking at the idea of state-led national green new deals is to see them as the latest episode in the 200-year-old history of efforts to save capitalism from itself. The difference is that in the past, unrestrained capitalism could only destroy one country’s political and economic order. Today, by continuing to boost carbon emissions, it can destroy the whole of modern civilisation.\nCapitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before 2008, we know it now\nThroughout modern history, just as today, there have been capitalists, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, who have called for the reform of capitalism, whether from conscience or fear of revolution, but, in the end, parliaments still had to pass the laws and states had to implement them. If we had left it to capitalism to regulate itself, seven-year-olds would still be working down coal mines – or, more likely, Britain would have collapsed into communism. Capitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before the crash of 2008, we certainly know it now.\nAdvertisement\nCentral to the taming of capitalism has always been the creation of welfare states. Enhanced social security and state healthcare as part of any green new deal are essential to the fight to limit carbon emissions for three reasons: to compensate those workers and sections of society that will suffer as a result of the abandonment of fossil fuels; to make the necessary sacrifices politically possible by sharing those sacrifices through progressive taxation; and to build the social and national resilience which we will need if our democratic orders are to survive the shocks of the decades to come – including the spread of tropical diseases as a result of climate change.\nThis need for social solidarity links the green new deal to the patriotic origins of the welfare state. Both conservatives and socialists have agreed in attributing the welfare state to socialism; conservatives because they have come to dislike it, the left because they want to claim all credit for it.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nIn fact, the origins of the British welfare state lie very largely in the social imperialism movement in the years before 1914. The supporters of this movement were an extraordinarily varied bunch: H G Wells, George Bernard Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the left; liberal imperialists such as Winston Churchill and William Beveridge; patriotic writers including Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle; imperial bureaucrats such as Lord Milner and John Buchan; and soldiers including Field Marshal Lord Roberts. Their thinking echoed, in key respects, Bismarck’s social security programme in Germany and the reformist “new nationalism” of Theodore Roosevelt in the US.\nAs Lord Roberts declared: “To tens of thousands of Englishmen engaged in daily toil, the call to ‘sacrifice’ themselves for their country must seem an insult to their reason; for those conditions amid which they work make their lives already an unending sacrifice.”\nWhat all these figures had in common was a fear of social disintegration and revolution; a belief (right or wrong) in the British Empire as a force for progress; and a belief that social solidarity, “national efficiency”, and a degree of national self-sufficiency were essential to survive what they (correctly) saw would be the colossal social, economic and political strains of a new European war.\nMy own thinking about this has also been shaped by my experience of working in Qatar, which has engaged in an intense and successful state-led effort at national self-sufficiency in response to the blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours.\nThe social imperialist tradition flowed into the later development of the welfare state as a result of the Second World War. In the course of these conflicts most of the Labour party became intensely patriotic, while the Conservatives became one-nation Tories, committed to social solidarity and state involvement in the economy.\nWhen, in 1960, Bernard Semmel wrote his classic study of social imperialism, Imperialism and Social Reform, he took for granted its victory on both sides of the political spectrum: “Today, the Cobdenites [ie radical free-market liberals] and the international socialists are virtually extinct breeds.”\nThis is the spirit we need to recover in response to the climate emergency and associated menaces. International agreements and protest movements are valuable and necessary but they can’t do anything themselves. Their purpose is to nudge and shame states into taking action. And state governments, in the end, take action on behalf of their national populations. That is their duty, and it is also what those populations expect and vote for.\nThe task then is to mobilise patriotism by convincing national populations that global heating is a threat, not just to humanity and the planet but to the interests and the future survival of their own countries; and that society, as a whole, will pull together, alleviate suffering and make sacrifices as part of a common effort.\nIf we can’t manage this I very much doubt that liberal democracy will survive what is coming at us down the line.\n• Anatol Lieven is the author of Climate Change and the Nation State: The Realist Case\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The therapist encourages her to “connect” with herself and “experience nature better”. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful “like the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree”. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead.\n“Serves me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,” Hardman writes. “There seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you’d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I’d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I’d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.”\nAdvertisement\nIt is a valuable lesson in Hardman’s The Natural Health Service, a practical and self-aware account of the relief from mental illness to be found outside. Hardman, and the many people she meets, identify respite, recovery and resilience in walking, running, cold-water swimming, gardening, “forest bathing”, birdwatching, botanising, horse riding and caring for pets. The common denominator is what Hardman calls “the great outdoors”, that plangent, hearty Victorian-sounding cliche. But as she shows, other species and their ecosystems can be rebellious medics. At times, the “natural” world resembles the magic mirror that undercuts Snow White’s stepmother: rather than reflecting back ourselves, it is alive with its own agency, a challenge to our narcissism.\nThe Natural Health Service is one of a rapidly growing forest of new books that examine cures found in nature. This winter alone has brought the publication of The Wild Remedy by Emma Mitchell; Losing Eden by Lucy Jones; Rootbound by Alice Vincent; and Wintering by Katherine May. One of last year’s unexpectedly prominent books – unexpected because it was rejected by publishers and crowdfunded via Unbound – was Bird Therapy by Joe Harkness. Just as trend is followed by takedown, so this spring sees a potential debunking in the form of Natural: The Seductive Myth of Nature’s Goodness by American philosopher Alan Levinovitz.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAuthor Isabel Hardman\nThe idea that human health can be salved by “nature” has been around for as long as we have regarded ourselves as a species apart from other living things. It truly arrived in Britain with the Romantics, for whom prosperity enabled a more reflective and worshipful relationship with the landscape that others had to toil in for a living. Keats and Byron loved swimming; sea-bathing was an upper-class health fad that inspired the first seaside resorts. The popularisation of nature’s healing power peaked after the industrial revolution, when later Victorians were beset by fears of the all-conquering machine. Fresh air, exercise and healthful hobbies, from collecting butterflies to finding fossils, were prescribed in much the same way as GPs today are experimenting with “prescribing nature” to patients. Hardman reminds us of the prescience of Octavia Hill, the social reformer and co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, who campaigned to save urban land for city parks. London commons that could make developers fortunes had greater value as outdoor space, Hill argued: “To my mind they are even now worth very much; but they will be more and more valuable every year – valuable in the deepest sense of the word; health-giving, joy-inspiring, peace-bringing.”\nAdvertisement\nIn Losing Eden, Jones shows that, ahead of today’s scientists, even Florence Nightingale was aware of how green space and plants can assist recovery from physical illness. In 1859, Nightingale wrote that when she had been ill, her recovery quickened after she received “a nosegay of wild flowers”. The nurse noticed in her patients that there was “most acute suffering when [the] patient can’t see out of the window”; Jones and Hardman both cite a more modern scientific study by Roger Ulrich who examined the records of 46 patients recovering from gall bladder surgery between 1972 and 1981. Some patients were randomly assigned a hospital bed with a view of deciduous trees; others a view of a brick wall. Those with a view of trees had shorter post-operative stays, took fewer painkillers and had fewer minor complications. And yet 40 years on, hospitals are run as “sterile” environments without plants, as Levinovitz notes in Natural: “An entirely unsuperstitious take on natural healing would recognise the importance of being around life – of facilitating hospital garden walks, say – instead of systematically excluding it.”\n¶\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nOut of the woods … green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery. Photograph: Travelpix Ltd/Getty Images\nAs the climate and extinction crisis quickens, so there is a rush for a literary cure. In Britain it began with Richard Mabey’s Nature Cure in 2005. In many of the most popular recent examples of nature writing, other species and wild places have played a healing role – for bereavement in Helen Macdonald’s H Is for Hawk, and alcoholism in Amy Liptrot’s The Outrun. Nature Cure (briefly) details Mabey’s mental breakdown after completing his magnum opus, Flora Britannica, and the succour he found by forgoing his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker plains of south Norfolk. When I ask Mabey if he regrets being midwife to the nature cure subgenre, an emphatic “yes” spills forth. “I feel slightly guilty about the title, which was my idea and it was very euphonious, but I quite soon began getting letters from people saying they loved the book but that it was not much to do with nature curing me. If a pedantic scholar counted the paragraphs that were to do with the illness, it probably amounts to about six pages,” he says. “Really it’s a book about encountering and adapting to a quite new landscape, which you could say was a post-cure experience.” Mabey had to reach a certain stage of recovery to write Nature Cure. As he, Hardman and other nature cure writers emphasise, they can be too ill to leave the house to imbibe the healing wild, and too ill to write, too.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s wonderful when it occurs; people in distress find that encounters with the natural world do restore them,” says Mabey. But two things concern him about the concept of a nature cure. “I’m worried that it’s become mooted as a kind of panacea – green Prozac. And if there’s anything wrong you just go out and look at the pretty flowers and you’re going to be marvellous. That’s a tall order if the natural world is in a state of crisis with the insect apocalypse and British songbirds collapsing all around us. There is also a danger that therapeutic nature becomes another way in which nature is reduced to service provider. The foregrounding of us being the centre of attention, the central agents of change and growth, all form part of a mindset that I think is obsolete. We need to rethink where we stand in relation to all these other organisms and what the transactions are between us, and stop saying they are all for our benefit, even though most of them probably are.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAuthor Richard Mabey. Photograph: Si Barber/The Guardian\nIn an insightful essay on nature cures, Richard Smyth quotes the poet Polly Atkin, who is diagnosed with chronic illnesses Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, a metabolic disorder that leads to a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. Like Mabey, Atkin has misgivings about this literary blossoming. “There is very little published work that points out how problematic it is – largely because the people who understand the problem are mainly those with incurable conditions and they’re often too busy being incurable to write books about nature,” she says. “More importantly, mainstream UK publishing is so attached to the ‘nature cure’ narrative that it can’t imagine another story to tell about how we relate to the world around us.”\nThe stage is set for a debunking of the literary nature cure but in Natural, it never quite arrives. At the end of the book, despite Levinovitz taking smart aim at the snake-oil salespeople of late capitalism – those selling expensive natural remedies, natural “cures” for cancer, or loudly advocating “wholly natural” childbirth, sex or sport – he concludes that there is something innately glorious about the non-human natural world.\nI’m worried it’s become mooted as a kind of panacea – if there’s anything wrong you just go out and look at the flowers\nRichard Mabey\nAdvertisement\nWhat Levinovitz critiques is what he sees as a religious attitude towards nature. An appeal to natural goodness – with “unnatural” as its evil twin – is among the most influential arguments in all human thought, ancient and modern, east and west. In fact, every human-made object is extracted from our planet; everything is “natural”. Levinovitz argues our veneration of “nature” is dangerous, citing former South African president Thabo Mbeki’s desire for Aids patients to take beetroot and other “natural” treatments. What Levinovitz does is help us to identify the “propagandists, bigots, demagogues, and marketeers who wrap their rhetoric in the mantle of ‘what’s natural’”.\nWhen it comes to making money from nature, the small, poorly renumerated band of writers proselytising for its health benefits do not enter Levinovitz’s line of fire. While H Is for Hawk will long stand as a literary classic, nature cure writing has taken a practical turn. Hardman and Harkness’s books are squarely self-help. Their qualities include brutal honesty and generous advice. Both authors, alongside others such as Jones and Mitchell, make clear that while time in the natural world has ameliorated their mental illnesses, so too have antidepressants and talking cures. These writers don’t succumb to the requirement for a happy ending either: no one suggests they are cured.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWild swimming in Snowdonia. Photograph: Stockimo/Alamy\nAdvertisement\nWe might wonder if a writing cure is also part of their wider recovery, but it is not always so. John Clare, who died in 1864, has long been the most notable nature writer with mental health problems. The Northamptonshire farm labourer, whose superb poems made him a literary sensation in the early 19th century, could be considered both evidence for and against the theory that nature makes us well. Did he only fall ill once embraced by literary London, psychically uprooted from his rural heartland? Or was he ill despite surrounding himself with nature? A country life is no guarantee of mental wellbeing: depression is a major problem in modern farming; plenty of farm workers endure it.\nThere is an echo of Clare’s experience in Harkness’s account of life since the publication of his debut, Bird Therapy. “I will never write about nature again,” says Harkness bluntly. He has been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder – mild medical terms for the crippling anxiety that Harkness vividly describes. After an attempted suicide and a breakdown, he began walking and discovered the exhilaration of encountering birds. “Of all the therapies I’ve tried,” he writes, “nothing has had the prolonged and positive impact that birdwatching has.” He spotted that the requirements of birdwatching matched the five ways to wellbeing devised by a project endorsed by the charity Mind: to connect, to take notice, to give, to keep learning and to be active.\nAs Harkness’s profile grew on social media, he decided to write a book, receiving high-profile endorsements, including an incisive foreword by the naturalist Chris Packham, who declared it an “exceptional” publication because it would save lives. Eight months on, Harkness recognises that his book has brought positive things: his honesty about mental illness has encouraged others to reciprocate. He has been told by readers that it has indeed saved their lives. Unfortunately, the online platform that enabled him to promote his book also damaged him. “The more open I was on social media, the less people engaged with me. If you’re already struggling with self-esteem, it is hell to be on it. The only way I could deal with it is not use Twitter any more,” he says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTenby in 1895 … sea-bathing, an upper-class health fad, inspired the first seaside resorts. Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nHe has also shed his illusions about the “guild” of nature writers. He imagined this literary world would be an inclusive salon for the free exchange of ideas about nature and mental health; instead he found a workplace, “a competitive market with a lot of emphasis on product and what you’re selling”, where “people become very focused on themselves”. One nature writer, he says, told him that Bird Therapy only sold well because of Packham’s foreword. Harkness, who is a special educational needs co-ordinator working with vulnerable young people, says he is so glad that writing is not his job. His post-book cure has been to remove himself from social media and literary “backslapping” and simplify his birdwatching regimen. “I don’t drive to birdwatch any more. I walk from my house. I’m under no pressure to see anything exciting. I’ve stopped commodifying it. I just think of being out where I should be. Whenever I do that I’m really thankful for it. Nature is not there to make me feel better. It’s something we can use to help us but ultimately we have to be there for it as well. And we’ve got to make wholesale changes to how we live.”\n¶\nSign up for Bookmarks: discover new books in our weekly email\nRead more\nMost nature cure books, both literary triumphs and practical manuals, are overwhelmingly about us. Perhaps we should catch more glimpses of other species as we look into the mirror? Mitchell’s The Wild Remedy, a diary of a year with severe depression, throws welcome attention on natural medicines – the thrilling dash of a sparrowhawk, or the cosy sight of ladybirds clustered together during winter in a knapweed seedhead. She recreates her encounters with other species around her home in Cambridgeshire in paintings, sketches, photographs and cabinets of curiosities. But, she says, “I’m not using my garden and the wood beyond my cottage as a sort of green Tesco, burgling myself some green serotonin and dopamine. It’s much more of a two-way relationship.” Mitchell, like Harkness, initially connected via social media with readers and others who lived with mental illness. She is not always well enough to visit a nearby wood every day. When she does, she monitors, observes and records the wildlife, and relays it to her audience. A biologist by training, Mitchell hopes her writing and art enlighten our increasingly urban society. “I’m trying to use the place where I live as a source of education for people who may not know what cherry plum blossom looks like – ‘This is coming into flower, go and see if you’ve got it on your patch,’” she says. Awakening readers to other species around us is a gift to those species, and it is bequeathed by almost every nature cure writer.\nAs humans reshape life on Earth, it’s hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain\nLast summer, an area of flowery meadowland in the wood near Mitchell exploded with life. The hot summer of 2018 must have produced “a metric fucktonne of caterpillars” she laughs: the following year there emerged hundreds of marbled white butterflies. “The dose of dopamine was just off the scale.” She filmed it for her social media followers. A few days later, in full flower, the meadow was scalped because of fears it contained ragwort, a flower that can in rare cases prove fatal to horses (and which landowners sometimes mistakenly believe they are obliged to control under an arcane “injurious” weeds law). An exquisite ecosystem was cut down at its peak. Alongside Mitchell’s enjoyment of this meadow emerged a deep connection with it, and a responsibility for it. “My connection with this land is not as a commodity. This is not skincare I get from a beauty parlour. This is not a monthly subscription to sniff some dead-nettle flowers. This is something that has changed my ability to live with my depression,” she says. In this case, she went into battle with her local council, at some personal cost – “I’m a spokesperson for thousands of invertebrates because they’ve got no voice,” she says – and succeeded in changing the cutting regime. The meadow won’t be cut again this year until the flowers and invertebrates have finished flowering and flying.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAuthor Emma Mitchell. Photograph: Martin Pope/The Guardian\nAdvertisement\nMitchell’s experience also reveals that in the Anthropocene, an era in which humans are reshaping all life on Earth, it is hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain. Lucy Jones’s Losing Eden is a passionate and thorough exploration of the growing scientific evidence showing why humans require other species to stay well – from a diversity of microbiota in our guts to a diversity of species in nearby green space. But she is aware that “the medicalisation of nature” also “demonstrates that we still see ourselves as takers and overseers, the authority figures, rather than being on an equal footing with the rest of nature”. Just as Mabey wonders if we can extract wellbeing from an environment we are traducing, so Jones considers the 21st-century challenge posed by ecological grief. Is the epidemic of mental illness in wealthy western societies in part because “some part of our spirits [is] afflicted by the mass burglary humanity has committed on the Earth?” Jones writes. “I know that I feel rotten and out of sorts when I am selfish or hurtful to the people around me”. The ecopsychologist and activist Chellis Glendinning diagnosed western culture as suffering from “original trauma” caused by our severance from nature and natural cycles. She noted that the symptoms were the same as PTSD: “hyperreactions; inappropriate outbursts of anger, psychic numbing; constriction of the emotions; and loss of a sense of control over our destiny”.\nThe Earth is our home and we are making ourselves homeless. Jones quotes the farmer-thinker Wendell Berry: “We are involved in a kind of lostness in which most people are participating more or less unconsciously in the destruction of the natural world, which is to say, the sources of our own lives.” Perhaps some of our lack of awareness, Jones thinks, is an instinctive denial of death; just as we block out our own mortality, so too we pretend our compulsive consumption is not hastening the premature end of our species’ enjoyment of the planet.\nAs Jones argues, despite all our writing about “nature”, we still lack the language to bring its jeopardy – our jeopardy – to the forefront of our troubled minds. Western consumption has made the planet ill, and now we are patients too. Grief and mental illness can be introspective and paralysing or they can inspire action.

His immediate predecessors rose through the ranks at the bank’s Threadneedle Street offices.\nCarney – who holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenship – was a polished technocrat with an international pedigree, described by the former chancellor George Osborne, who courted him for a year, as “the outstanding central banker of his generation”.\nCarney, now 54, arrived on UK soil following a spectacular rise that included a five-and-a-half year stint as governor of Canada’s central bank and 13 years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs before that.\nHe hands back the reins to Andrew Bailey, a Bank of England lifer, who must wield the central bank’s considerable resources to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus.\nHere we look back at five key moments in Carney’s BoE career:\nForward guidance\nWhen he took over from Mervyn King in 2013, Carney was determined to give businesses, consumers and financial markets a clear view of the bank’s interest rate policy. Specifically, he wanted to show how the bank’s base rate would move looking two years ahead. Already a popular concept in the US, forward guidance took over from the bank’s traditional assessment of what to do that month based on the available data.\nAdvertisement\nAt his first quarterly inflation report meeting in August 2013, he said a fall in unemployment from 7.8% to below 7% would trigger a rise in interest rates from their then all-time low of 0.5%.\nBut unemployment quickly tumbled below 7% without any discernible jump in wages – which would have pushed up inflation and triggered a rate rise. Carney, the outsider, had misread the flexibility of the UK labour market and how fragile workers felt after the financial crash.\nA year later, the Labour MP Pat McFadden, a member of the Treasury select committee, accused Carney of behaving like an “unreliable boyfriend”. Carney was a man who promised much and delivered very little, he said. It was a cruel jibe that stuck. Carney has never backed down, however. He defended forward guidance at his last appearance before MPs earlier this month.\nProject Fear\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nThe outgoing governor has been a lightning rod in the Brexit debate. Accused by Brexiters of abandoning the political neutrality expected of him and backing the remain campaign, he was admonished in the spring of 2016 as a “Project Fear” figurehead because of his repeated warnings about the negative economic impact of leaving the EU.\nThe row continued after the referendum. He clashed with the rightwing European Research Group, and in 2017 was branded an “enemy of Brexit” by its leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg. After the Bank warned in November 2018 that a no-deal Brexit could trigger a recession worse than the 2008 financial crisis, Carney was blasted on the front page of the Telegraph for unleashing “Project Hysteria”.\nIn an intervention undermining Carney’s authority, Lord King urged MPs to pursue a no-deal Brexit, saying it would have little impact on the British economy in the long run.\nBrexit vote\nCarney’s immediate reaction to the leave vote in June 2016 was feted by nervous investors.\nDubbed “the only adult in the room” at the time, he was the first to react when early economic indicators showed business confidence falling through the floor. He stepped in days after the vote on 30 June to say an interest rate cut was needed to steady the ship. Jittery financial markets rallied and stability was restored. The bank’s monetary policy committee duly delivered a rate cut a few weeks later.\nWhile Carney did sound the alarm before the EU referendum about a recession that never ultimately materialised, his other warnings about the negative economic consequences have come to pass: the pound crashed, inflation spiked, economic growth slowed and the average household has been left worse off.\nEnvironment\nCarney’s drive to push the climate emergency up the world’s agenda stakes his claim for a lasting legacy. The governor first sounded the alarm over the risks to financial markets and the global economy in a speech in 2015, when he warned about the “tragedy of the horizon”.\nIn a landmark speech to the insurance market Lloyd’s of London, he said the world was running out of time to deal with global heating as the risks mounted from extreme weather events.\nCarney sides with Greta Thunberg against Trump over climate\nRead more\nBefore Carney, central banks had typically kept away from climate issues. However, the Bank’s governor used a letter to the Guardian in 2019 to warn that the financial system faces an existential threat, placing the issue squarely on the agenda for global central banks.\nStress tests on banks’ climate risks, proposed and developed on Carney’s watch, will take place next year under Bailey. Although he is leaving the Bank, Carney will advise Boris Johnson on climate-related financial risks for the Cop26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow later this year.\nCoronavirus\nThe biggest challenge for the world economy since the financial crisis hit just as the governor was preparing to leave. Carney used his final week in charge to launch an emergency interest rate cut – the first since the 2008 credit crunch – slashing borrowing costs in a coordinated move alongside Rishi Sunak’s first budget as chancellor.\nThreadneedle Street cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking the key determinant of borrowing costs for households and businesses to the lowest level in the Bank’s 325-year history.\nAdvertisement\nIn a double-headed press conference alongside Bailey, he said the economic shock from the coronavirus would be large but ultimately temporary, as nations step up their response to the disease.\nStock markets around the world crashed the following day by the most since Black Monday in October 1987, amid widespread investor panic over the dwindling chances of a quick recovery in the global economy.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

How we dress feeds off cravings to be different as well as part of a tribe; to be en vogue but ahead of the pack. The message from the high street is that such wishes can be fulfilled, and fast fashion plays on the idea that hunger can be sated immediately. But to overcome such urges we need to reflect on the fragility of our planet. This means accepting that there is a better way to keep the pleasures of fashion open to all parts of society than promoting disposable clothes as desirable. This is not just about the high cost of the £4 dress; luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton have offered small collections every two weeks.\nThe fashion industry has benefited from globalisation to mass-produce goods by externalising the costs of production in the form of human and environmental damage. Every year, 100bn new garments are produced by one out of six people worldwide. Yet only 2% of them earn a living wage. In this country it is an open secret that some garment factories are not paying the minimum wage.\nAdvertisement\nFashion shouldn’t cost the earth. But the industry has for too long promoted overconsumption as a good thing. About a fifth of mass-produced clothing does not even sell and ends up being buried, shredded or burned. Garments now account for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic fibres are being found in Arctic sea ice and in fish.\nBritain has too readily embraced throwaway society. Shoppers in the UK buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe. It was a mistake last year for ministers not to take up MPs’ suggestion to reward via taxation companies that design products with lower climate footprints and penalise those that do not. Messages from public figures, such as the environmentalist Greta Thunberg, about not buying clothes has helped to persuade people to turn their backs on fast fashion. New research shows that 51% of Britons are opting to purchase expensive but longer-lasting clothes rather than cheaper throwaway items, up from 33% a year ago.\nSign up for the Fashion Statement email\nRead more\nThe market is belatedly responding to the mood. Big brands such as H&M and Zara have made new commitments to sustainability. John Lewis has this week introduced labelling to encourage a culture of handing down children’s clothes. Nudie Jeans has become a success, with organic products and stores that promote repair services and resale.\nAt no other time in human history has fashion been so accessible to so many people. Technology will help to make fashion greener. Better regulation of supply chains will help too. There is a discernible shift from discarding clothes to repairing, reusing or even renting them. However, it is hard to see how this will be enough to make fashion truly sustainable if the industry still produces more and more clothes. Once normal service is resumed, we need to think again about the wisdom of fostering competitive consumption, which upholds the persistent demand for expansion, in our society.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This construction timber will be substituted for concrete and steel, which together are responsible for 12% of global carbon emissions.\nAdvertisement\nThere is little point in saving the curlew’s habitat if, as a consequence, we lose the battle against climate change. It’s time the RSPB acknowledged the bigger picture.\nPaul Brannen\nFormer MEP and member of the EU’s agriculture committee\n• Government policy is based on advice from independent organisations like the Committee on Climate Change, which examine the evidence on carbon sequestration to take a full life-cycle picture.\nThe full evidence on the carbon benefits of fast-growing trees does take into account all the uses of wood harvested in the UK and recognises that the trees are replaced with new fast-growing trees.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWood burned for energy replaces non-renewable fossil fuels, and wood used, for example, in a fence, does not magically give up its carbon to the atmosphere when that fence is replaced (with more wood). Typically, it is reused and recycled. This adds to the positive carbon story and is an exemplar of reuse.\nIt is irresponsible to raise the spectre of land management practices, specifically planting on ground containing deep peat, which ended decades ago and will not happen again. The claims that newly planted native woodlands are much richer in wildlife than modern forests planted to produce wood and designed against high standards is also not supported by the evidence.\nIf we are serious about tackling climate change and benefiting nature, we need to base policy on the full suite of evidence and embrace positive solutions.\nStuart Goodall\nChief executive, Confor: Promoting forestry and wood\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

When will rich countries like ours recognise that growth is damaging the planet and prejudicing the lives of our grandchildren?\nRishi Sunak’s budget has allocated £27bn for roadbuilding and a further £4.2bn to eight local authorities for transport projects (Report, 12 March). He hasn’t said (and may not know) how much carbon dioxide these measures, and the resultant traffic, will add to the already overloaded atmosphere and the concomitant heating of the planet.\nA rich country? According to the Social Metrics Commission, using government data, there are 14.3 million people living in poverty in the UK.

It may be claimed that our economy needs to grow in order to support the poor, but there is little evidence that this happens.\nAdvertisement\nWhat is needed is a redistribution of existing wealth, not a grab for more.

The Labour party is beginning to talk of this, the Tories should as well.\nMichael Bassey\nNewark, Nottinghamshire\n• I think I got a bit carried away with the idea that the 40-odd years of malingering Thatcherite neoliberalism was finally dead.

She has become virtually a nomad in her own country after rising tides forced her to leave her ancestral atoll and move to the main island, Funafuti.\nShe is now a climate activist. She can no longer visit her home island, yet remains committed to her country with a burning desire to prevent her own children from inheriting an underwater ghost town. This is not just Milikini’s story.\nWhile climate change threatens livelihoods and security around the world, it is women who are bearing the brunt. Women predominate in the workforces of many sectors that are most vulnerable to climate change such as agriculture, livestock and fishing.\nTo make things worse, inequalities mean women are more likely to suffer dislocation to their lives as a result of flooding and drought. According to the UN, about 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. More than 70% of those displaced by the 2010 flooding in Pakistan were women and children.\nAmong those who lost their lives in India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka as a result of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, three times more women died than men. But why?\nRigid gender roles in the region meant men in the region were more likely to be able to swim than women. Furthermore, women were more likely to be caring for children and family members during the critical evacuation time.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWomen who do survive such disasters often end up in unclean evacuation centres where they can be exposed to gender-based violence and cannot access health services. Research by the International Union for Conservation of Nature found climate change and environmental impacts are increasing violence against women and girls including domestic abuse, child marriage and sexual assault.\nIn many societies, encouraging progress is being made towards gender equality, but climate change can stop or even reverse this progress.\nIf business-as-usual climate action continues, there are dangers that the gains of gender equality will be lost. There is a risk that as climate change accelerates, gender roles could become more entrenched. More men may be forced to move in search of better job opportunities, while women are left behind to care for members of their extended families and bear the burden of household responsibilities. Those who have to remain in more disaster-prone or vulnerable locations as a result are then likely to experience greater poverty, have their livelihoods destroyed and suffer increasing health issues.\nWe know that any attempts to restore environmental degradation and lower the risks posed by global heating are likely to fail if they do not take into account gender inequality.\nWe know, from a report published last week by WaterAid, that climate finance is still not reaching the poorest and most vulnerable people, who are likely to be most affected by climate change. – about half of all countries receive less than $5 (£3.86) a year for each person.\nIn 2016, a UN report found that only 0.01% of all worldwide funding went towards projects addressing both climate change and gender, despite specific provisions in the 2015 Paris agreement for women’s empowerment.\nSuch statistics are sobering, but there are some encouraging signs of progress. Developed countries have pledged $100bn a year in climate finance by 2020 to help developing nations cut emissions and adapt to problems such as worsening droughts, flooding and sea-level rise. The Green Climate Fund, the main channel through which climate finance is dispersed, stipulates that all grants must treat women’s needs as a priority.\nThe Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub, based in Mauritius, is already making impressive progress in unlocking much-needed resources for countries and communities that would not otherwise have the capacity to lodge successful applications for funding already pledged.\nClimate breakdown 'is increasing violence against women'\nRead more\nAt the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda in June, we can expect leaders to consider further innovative approaches to tackle environmental priorities, including the strategy proposed by women’s affairs ministers, which focuses on gender and climate change.\nThe strategy is designed to encourage countries to collect and analyse data disaggregated according to criteria such as sex and age in order to devise improved climate solutions and to target them more accurately.\nWomen like Milikini need more than speeches, however sincere. They need urgent collective action to tackle all aspects and impacts of the global climate crisis.

The analysts on Thursday slashed forecasts for new solar power projects by 8%. It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too.\n“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,” Birol said. He said global governments should use the economic stimulus packages which are being planned to help countries weather the downturn to invest in clean energy technologies.\nHe added: “We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.”\nThe IEA’s analysis has shown 70% of the world’s clean energy investments are government-driven, either through direct government finance or in response to policies such as subsidies or taxes. The watchdog has also found government fossil fuel subsidies total $400bn (£300bn) each year.\nBirol urged global governments to invest in energy efficiency measures, which might not offer good short-term returns while energy prices are low but would prove a lucrative investment in the longer-term.\nThe IEA head also urged policymakers to use the downturn in global oil prices to phase out or scrap fossil fuels subsidies, which could be used to boost healthcare spending.\n“These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments,” he said. “But the good news is that compared to economic stimulus packages of the past we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles, and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition.\n“If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added.\nAmerica faces an epic choice ...\n... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation.

Thatcherism, a term used by the late Stuart Hall and others around Marxism Today in the 1980s, signified a new Tory policy of “authoritarian populism” as they saw it. Perhaps that does capture Johnson’s perspective. The significant change, however, was a move from looking to the manufacturing industry as the key source of riches for the wealthy towards the financial and services sector. By contrast Johnson’s policies seem to reflect a well-funded Micawberism. Something will turn up to allow him to stay in office and he’ll back whatever that may be. It hardly amounts to a coherent ideology.\nKeith Flett\nLondon\nAdvertisement\n• In 1972, the then chancellor of the exchequer, Anthony Barber, delivered his now infamous “Barber boom” budget injecting the then unheard-of amount of £1.8bn into the economy. This confounded Harold Wilson’s Labour opposition who were at the time tearing themselves apart over, amongst other things, their poor economic growth performance while in government in 1964-1970.\nLike Sunak’s budget on Wednesday, the Tories were stealing Labour’s policy of Keynesian-driven growth. However, it all ended very badly for both the Tories and Britain, with the first recession since the second world war, rapid inflation, higher unemployment and the largest balance of payments deficit ever previously recorded. But by then it was Wilson’s problem as the Tories lost the February 1974 election. Will history judge Sunak’s budget in the same way it judges Barber’s?\nAlan Bancroft\nLondon\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\n• It has long been acknowledged that the funding of social care is inadequate, that the system is in need of a major overhaul and NHS performance is intimately linked to care services. However, yet again – and despite earlier claims that Mr Johnson is a “man with a plan” – the issue has been ignored by a chancellor who found no difficulty spraying public money around. The health and social care secretary may justify his colleague’s inaction by telling us that he is convening cross-party discussions to arrive at a consensus, but surely even he can see that one of the ways of oiling the wheels of collaboration is to provide a budget against which sustainable solutions can be developed and introduced.\nLes Bright\nExeter\n• The chancellor’s announcement of a “green gas levy” might appear to be a welcome step in battling the climate emergency (UK takes first small steps to tackle carbon from worst polluters, 12 March), though it’s worth noting that the non-domestic renewable heat incentive (RHI) has subsidised the production of “green” natural gas (biomethane) for a number of years, and is funded from general taxation. So potentially this isn’t a new measure, and is just moving the funding from indirect taxation to a regressive direct tax.\nSimon Richards\nBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire\n• Budget day was a wonderful opportunity for the chancellor to have an impact on the country’s carbon output by increasing the fuel duty at a time when the price of fuel was falling. When is the government going to take the climate crisis seriously?\nDr David Rowe\nNewcastle upon Tyne\n• Let’s state the position in simple words: a budget that is just repairing the damage to the British economy and social wellbeing brought about by 10 years of unnecessary Tory austerity government.

The process, requiring machines operating thousands of metres under the sea, could also create plumes of sediment that smother areas far from the mining sites and kill wildlife.\nDozens of exploratory licences, two of which are sponsored by the UK, have already been granted for huge tracts of the sea bed, ahead of a race to mine commercially for ores and minerals such as copper, used in mobile phones and batteries. But the rules to govern the responsible exploitation of this global resource are not finalised – they are expected to be completed at a meeting in July at the UN International Seabed Authority.\nAttenborough, the vice president of FFI, said deep sea mining could create a “devastating series of impacts” threatening processes critical to the health and function of the oceans, and called on governments to be guided by scientists.\n“Fauna & Flora International is calling on global governments to put in place a moratorium on all deep sea mining – a call I wholeheartedly support,” Attenborough said.\nIn a foreword to the report, Attenborough said it was “beyond reason” for countries to consider the destruction of deep sea places before they have understood them or the role they play in the health of the planet.\nAttenborough said: “The rush to mine this pristine and unexplored environment risks creating terrible impacts that cannot be reversed. We need to be guided by science when faced with decisions of such great environmental consequence.”\nFFI warned that human activity was already putting a huge strain on the oceans, which have absorbed a third of our carbon emissions and 93% of the extra heat trapped by the rising concentration of greenhouse gases.\nOceans are becoming more acidic because of the carbon dioxide dissolving into them, fisheries are under pressure as a result of over-exploitation and there are hundreds of huge “dead zones”, it said.\nIn too deep: why the seabed should be off-limits to mining companies\nChris Packham\nRead more\nPippa Howard, director at FFI and lead author of the report, called for a moratorium on deep sea mining. She said: “The conclusions we have come to after extensive study could hardly be more troubling.\n“From methane release to disruption of the ocean’s life-support systems and the destruction of unstudied ecosystems, the risks of deep sea mining are numerous and potentially disastrous.”\nLouise Casson, of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign, said the UK government’s holding of exploration contracts for deep sea mining was at odds with its position as a “global ocean champion”.\nCasson said: “The UK government now has a choice to make: listen to industry and press ahead with this dangerous new practice, or listen to scientific warnings, public concern and the creator of Blue Planet himself and ban deep sea mining.”\nAdvertisement\nA government spokesman said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction.\n“While we have sponsored two exploration licences, these allow only for marine research to understand the effects of deep sea mining.\n“We will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

You’re able to do things differently.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe spot for the launch – Coed Brynau - is a beautiful one. High above Neath, with views of the Brecon Beacons and the Mumbles Lighthouse, Coed Cadw (the Woodland Trust in Wales) is in the process of planting 150,000 trees here by 2025, including rare species such as the small-leaved lime and the black poplar.\nThe estate used to be owned by the coalmine owner and Tory MP Herbert Mackworth (1687-1765), who created a parkland on the hill. There are vestiges of ancient woodland that will be linked with the new tree planting.\nThe area is home to barn owls, Daubenton’s bats and possibly the very rare blue ground beetle. Welsh white cows, which look ghostly in the landscape, are being introduced to graze grassland areas of the site.\nThere is not yet a route for the forest – this will evolve as the consultation moves on.\nAdvertisement\nBut Natalie Buttriss, director of Coed Cadw, suggested one option could be to link the great forest of Wentwood in Monmouthshire along the M4 corridor to Coed Brynau.\nIt could then head north towards the “Celtic rainforest” of mid Wales and Snowdonia, one of the most important and historic habitats in Wales, and perhaps veer east towards Wrexham, where a plan is in place to increase the urban tree canopy to a minimum of 20% by 2026.\nChris Matts, Coed Cadw’s woodland manager for south and west Wales, likes the government’s ambition, though he thinks perhaps forest is the wrong word. “It’s a word that in English originally meant a hunting ground for kings,” he said.\nMatts prefers the Welsh word: coed, which has more of the connotation of “an area of trees”, which takes in parkland and hedgerows as well as thick forest and woodland.\nMary Gagen, a professor of geography at Swansea University, praised the ambition of the scheme. “We need to get trees in the ground now. Trees are a brilliant multi-tasker, good for the environment, good for habitats, good for us.”\nThe Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the February floods reinforced the need to plant more trees.\n“In planting, growing and protecting the right network of trees we can increase our resilience to flooding.\n“Trees improve air quality, they remove harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, they provide material for construction, they regenerate soil for food, they clean the water in our rivers and they provide a home to all the life that finds shelter in their canopy.\n“The project is ambitious and dynamic and will not grow overnight. Over the next 20 years, we will work with all kinds of stakeholders – from the Woodland Trust to farmers, landowners and school pupils – to grow the right network of trees that will greatly improve biodiversity, trap carbon from the air and provide economic opportunities too.\n“These ambitious projects work – the Wales Coast Path, which created a path around the entire coastline of Wales, has been a real success story. We’re looking forward to growing a forest that benefits Wales for future generations to come.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The report concludes it was a record-breaking year for heat, and there was rising hunger, displacement and loss of life owing to extreme temperatures and floods around the world.\nScientists said the threat was greater than that from the coronavirus, and world leaders must not be diverted away from climate action.\nThe climate assessment is led by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the UN’s agencies for environment, food, health, disasters, migration and refugees, as well as scientific centres.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2019 the oceans were at the hottest on record, with at least 84% of the seas experiencing one or more marine heatwaves. Surface air temperatures around the world were the hottest ever recorded, after a natural El Niño event boosted figures in 2016.\nThe report says results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate 2018-19 was the 32nd year in a row in which more ice was lost than gained. The melting of land ice combined with thermal expansion of water pushed sea levels up to the highest mark since records began.\nThe long-term decline of Arctic sea ice also continued in 2019, with the September average extent – usually the lowest of the year – the third worst on record.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris agreement calls for,” said Guterres. 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. “Time is fast running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption and protect our societies.”\nHe added: “We need more ambition on [emission cuts], adaptation and finance in time for the climate conference, Cop26, in Glasgow, UK, in November. That is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.”\nProf Brian Hoskins, of Imperial College London, said: “The report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.”\nTimeline\nHalf a century of dither and denial – a climate crisis timeline\nShow\nFossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s\n1959\nThe physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”\n1965\nLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.”\n1970\nShell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.\n1977\nA recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\n1981\nAn internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.\n1988\nThe Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”\n2 January 1988\nA confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.\n1989\nExxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.\n1990\nExxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.\n1991\nShell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.\n1992\nAt the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”\n1997\nTwo month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”\n1998\nThe US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.\n2009\nThe US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray.\n1 January 2013\nA study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.\n1 January 2016\nThe API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.\n1 January 2017\nExxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.\n2019\nMohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.\nJonathan Watts\nWas this helpful?\nThe WMO said its report provided authoritative information for policymakers on the need for climate action and showed the impacts of extreme weather.\nA heatwave in Europe was made five times more likely by global heating, and the scorching summer led to 20,000 emergency hospital admissions and 1,462 premature deaths in France alone. India and Japan also sweltered and Australia started and ended the year with severe heat and had its driest year on record. Australia had “an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season”, the WMO noted.\nFloods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and its neighbours, Cyclone Fani in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018.\nThe US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said.\nUnpredictable climate and extreme weather was a factor in 26 of the 33 nations that were hit by food crises in 2019, and was the main driver in 12 of the countries. “After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available,” the report says.\nThe WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.\nProf Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, said: “This annual litany of climate change impacts and inadequate global responses makes for a gut-wrenching read. Writ large is the ‘threat multiplier’ effect that is climate change on the biggest challenges faced by humanity and the world’s ecosystems in the 21st century.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Everything we do now has to pass the climate test","paragraph":"Y\nou may have read that there are just eight, or 10, or 12 years to save the world from the climate crisis. There are not. It is already here, gaining strength every day as carbon emissions pour into the atmosphere. It is a slow-motion disaster. Action to avert the worst should have started last week, last year, last decade.\nThis is not a message of despair, though, but one of measured hope. The gap between the action we could take to reduce global heating and the action we are actually taking can be measured by a brutally simple metric: human suffering. That means every action that closes that gap, however small, is meaningful.\nDeadlines focus efforts. They convert temperature rises and atmospheric carbon budgets into a value we understand: time\nDeadly floods, hurricanes, heatwaves and bushfires are already taking lives and ruining livelihoods, and large and rapid cuts in carbon emissions are needed to prevent the damage from becoming far greater. But there is no deadline after which the planet explodes, no point at which action becomes pointless.\nThe idea of a deadline for saving civilisation stems from a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a collaboration of the world’s top scientists. It found that cutting emissions by about 45% by 2030 would give a reasonable chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C, the target agreed on by UN nations in Paris in 2015.\nAdvertisement\nBut the scientists who wrote the report have said it is wrong to interpret that as a 12-year deadline, with some suggesting a Guardian headline at the time is partly to blame. Other media, such as the Washington Post, used similar framing, and the 12-year deadline has been cited by people as disparate as UN secretary general António Guterres, Prince Charles and Jeremy Corbyn. With a problem to solve, setting a timeline feels necessary.\nBut Greta Thunberg, with characteristic clarity, recently spelled out the mistake: “It’s never too late to do as much as we can, every fraction of a degree matters,” she says. “There are of course no magical dates for saving the world.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nFundamentally, fighting the climate crisis is about fighting the injustice that it magnifies. Preventing the poor, who played no part in fuelling the climate fire, from getting burned. Enabling those with little wealth to build dignified lives without the use of coal, oil and gas. Creating a better world, where we stop exploiting the planet as if its resources were infinite and, through cooperation, learn to live within our means.\nAs Prof Myles Allen of the University of Oxford has pointed out, slavery was once a highly profitable provider of energy and we brought it to an end because it was an affront to the values that make us human.\nAll very noble, you might be thinking. But what about the cost of action? The answer is that the cost of inaction is far greater. The Paris agreement already passes the cost-benefit test and, in any case, there is no economic growth on a destructive, hothouse Earth – as the financial sector is beginning to recognise.\nTaken together, the justice and economic arguments make it imperative that every decision taken every day by governments, businesses and communities must pass the climate test: will it cut emissions? From power plants to buildings, transport to farming, projects commissioned today will be running well beyond 2030.\nAt the Glasgow climate conference, the UK could kickstart a green tech revolution\nMike Mason\nRead more\nTackling the climate emergency means tough decisions today, not promises for tomorrow. In the UK, one imminent test is whether the government’s long-delayed £100bn national infrastructure plan, which includes many green initiatives, survives the coronavirus outbreak.\nDeadlines can focus efforts. In the case of the climate emergency, they convert targets for surface temperature rises and atmospheric carbon budgets into a value everyone understands: time.\nAdvertisement\nSo here’s one: 19 November 2020. That is when the UN climate change conference, hosted by Boris Johnson and the UK government, is due to end. Unless nations dramatically increase their pledges to cut emissions, we will remain on track for a terrifying 3-4C of heating.\nEvery effort must be made to achieve success. But even if this deadline is missed, it will not be too late, because every act reduces human suffering. As Prof Mick Hulme, at the University of Cambridge, says: “History does not end, the future is not preordained and it is never too late to do the right thing.”\n• Damian Carrington is the Guardian’s environment editor\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Only 33% of the wood used by sawmills was for construction, where wood used in permanent buildings can lock in carbon for decades. Much of sawmill wood was used for fencing (36%) with a service life of 15 years, or packaging and pallets (24%) or paper (4%).\n“There is no point growing a lot of fast-growing conifers with the logic that they sequester carbon quickly if they then go into a paper mill because all that carbon will be lost to the atmosphere within a few years,” said Thomas Lancaster, head of UK land policy at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which commissioned the report. “We should not be justifying non-native forestry on carbon grounds if it’s not being used as a long-term carbon store.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRare and declining species such as the curlew cannot survive close to plantations. Photograph: Sandra Standbridge/Alamy\nThe Committee on Climate Change has called for 1.5 billion new trees by 2050 – requiring planting on 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of land a year, increasing Britain’s forest cover from 13% to 19%.\nAdvertisement\nMany of these new forests will also provide a commercial timber crop. But the scientific review by the ecologist Ellie Crane of how forestry can best address the climate and biodiversity crisis finds that there is no simple solution in Britain.\nThe best place for non-native conifers to quickly sequester carbon is on intensively farmed lowland but this high-quality agricultural land is too expensive for forestry to make financial sense for landowners.\nReplanting Britain: 'It’s about the right tree in the right place'\nRead more\nPlanting conifers on the cheapest land such as the blanket bogs of Scotland’s Flow Country is “disastrous” for biodiversity, according to Lancaster, but also leads to carbon emissions because the bogs are drained for forestry and the peat degrades, releasing carbon into the atmosphere.\nThis leaves “shallow peat” moorlands of western Scotland, south and mid-Wales and parts of the Lake District and the Pennines as the most likely locations for new carbon-sequestering forests. Here, the RSPB has concerns about the impact on wildlife. Rare and declining species such as the curlew that breed on open moorland cannot survive close to plantations, which become home to predators of their chicks such as crows.\nWhile the best option for wildlife and slower but long-term carbon sequestration is to plant broadleaved woodlands in the right locations and leave them intact, if Britain does not produce its own timber it will import more – in effect exporting its carbon footprint overseas.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHow soil offers hope for the climate crisis\n“It’s clearly not just a question of more trees equals a safer climate. Trees in the wrong place could exacerbate climate change and biodiversity decline,” said Lancaster. “There’s also a big question around the capacity of Natural England and regulatory bodies in Scotland and Wales and the forestry commissions to properly assess what impact any planting schemes will have on nature, both good and bad, and on the climate.\nAdvertisement\n“If we’re serious about tackling the climate and ecological emergency there needs to be a huge government investment in capacity to get that right, otherwise we’re going to have lots of inappropriate planting which could be negative for the climate as well as biodiversity.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

We have now had 25 of them – the 26th Conference of the Parties (Cop26) will take place in Glasgow in November – yet greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise inexorably. Cops – especially the one in Paris in 2015 – have changed attitudes and influenced policy. But to meet the goal of reducing global emissions to net zero by mid-century we have to start doing something substantial and different in addition to seeking stronger commitments at Cop26.\nThe good news is that there are now real grounds for optimism that we can slow and ultimately stop greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy currently outcompetes fossil fuels in many areas and continues to become cheaper every year. New energy storage options, ranging from cheaper batteries to green ammonia, are emerging. New ways to produce proteins at scale without destroying rainforests are being developed.\nWhen these solutions become so good, and so cheap, that they routinely outcompete their fossil fuel and biodiversity-destroying counterparts, greenhouse gas emissions will decline to near zero. Getting there, though, needs some serious focus on green technologies supported by policies that will get them rolled out.\nQ&A\nWhat is Cop – and how will it help?\nShow\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nA research group in Oxford, led by my co-authors and myself has been identifying groups of “unicorn” technologies, named by analogy with “unicorn” startups valued at over $1bn, that can each deliver a reduction of at least a billion tonnes of CO2 a year. Unicorns don’t depend on fundamental new discoveries so should be ready for large-scale deployment within a decade. With a moderate investment in research and development or other support, they could in combination unlock multiple benefits across whole “energy ecosystems”.\nOne example of such an ecosystem centres on converting cheap renewable energy – either from sunny places with few people, or spare wind from the North Sea – into hydrogen and ammonia, to provide zero-carbon fuel for shipping, heavy goods vehicles and even potentially aviation. They could provide the energy storage needed to complement variable wind and solar energy, process heat for industry, and turn iron ore into steel. The technologies that would unlock this ecosystem are the next generation of high-efficiency solar cells, low-cost electrolysers, and hydrogen and ammonia fuel cells and engines. All are proven technologies that simply need to be cheaper – further development could rapidly unlock a virtuous circle of falling costs and increased deployment.\nThey would allow least-developed and developed nations to share ambitions and interests in technologies where they have comparative advantages, such as solar resources, land or skills\nAnother example is exceptionally water-efficient plants that can grow in semi-arid areas or on degraded land – prickly pear, pineapples and euphorbias are examples. Such plants could sequester carbon in soil on a large scale, and be fermented to proteins in place of soya beans, whose growth causes widespread deforestation and huge greenhouse gas emissions; they could even be used to make plastics. The unicorn technologies in this case include learning how to grow plants that we have historically ignored, along with precision separation and fermentation of the biomass.\nGetting a bold, unanimous agreement to ratchet up global ambition to act on climate at Cop26 will be very hard at this stage of the game, with the usual cabal of petro-states and coal producers doing their utmost to dilute any decisions of consequence. However, an approach focused around “coalitions of the willing” in the bottom-up spirit of the Paris climate agreement, could enable substantial progress without being stymied by vested interests.\nEach of these coalitions, built from nation states but also regions and even corporates, could focus on one or more of the unicorns. They would support research and development, advance demonstrators, or provide lower-cost finance or performance guarantees to encourage rollout and help the technologies become cheaper. They would allow least-developed and developed nations to share ambitions and interests in technologies where they have comparative advantages, such as solar resources, land or skills. Management and licensing of intellectual property could encourage coalitions to form and accelerate technology deployment.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Management and licensing of intellectual property could encourage coalitions to form and accelerate technology deployment.’ Benban Solar Park in Aswan, Egypt. Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA\nAdvertisement\nThe formation of these coalitions could be seen as evolution of an earlier UK initiative called Mission Innovation. It targeted sectors or problems, rather than – as we are proposing – selected technology areas that underwrite whole energy ecosystems, which we believe would be a very much more productive approach.\nThis should not be seen as “picking winners”, but rather as “picking runners”. Funders should be prepared to see failures as well as successes.\nAs co-chair with Italy of Cop26, the UK has an excellent opportunity to build coalitions that would lead to cheaper alternatives to fossil fuels. The UK is home to several companies and world experts in both the “hydrammonia” economy and semi-arid plants, and British businesses could be leading players in these two examples of ecosystems.\nLet’s enjoy some good climate news: the block on UK onshore wind farms is no more\nMax Wakefield\nRead more\nIn parallel with preparing for Cop26, the government should also change the UK’s broad approach. Neither academia nor industry on their own has the principal objective of solving the climate crisis. They have neither skills nor funding to develop technologies that are (nearly) out of the laboratory, build demonstrators when necessary, and create the technical and financial conditions needed to enable large-scale rollout. We believe the UK needs something like the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, created in the US, which “advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment”.\nBy fostering coalitions of the willing, which would focus on clusters of unicorn technologies, the UK could make a major contribution to solving the climate crisis. Cop26 could indeed be a turning point – but it cannot simply be more of the same.\n• Mike Mason is a fellow at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford.

So from a boat half a mile from shore, Furness is feeding a long rope into the water, which carries a little hessian bag of seagrass seeds every metre. “We’ve passed the 800,000 seed mark now,” she says.\nThe Seagrass Ocean Rescue project will ultimately place 20km of rope and a million seeds on the shallow seafloor, where they will sprout through the bags and restore the habitat.\nSeagrass meadows were once common around the UK coast, but more than 90% have been lost as a result of algae-boosting pollution, anchor damage and port and marina building. The meadows, however, store carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and harbour up to 40 times more marine life than seabeds without grass, facts that are driving the effort to bring them back.\nThe UK’s biggest seagrass restoration scheme – in pictures\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA seagrass and maerl bed in the Orkneys. Photograph: WWF-UK\n“We face a growing climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency, and we have to make rapid steps to fight those,” says Richard Unsworth at Swansea University and lead biologist on the £400,000 project, which is supported by WWF and Sky Ocean Rescue.\nAdvertisement\nSeagrass covers just 0.2% of the ocean but provides an estimated 10% of its carbon storage. It is in trouble around the world, and Unsworth hopes the first project of its kind in the UK may help boost take-up of this nature-based solution to the climate crisis.\nSeagrass can grow up to 1 metre long. Its flowers are pollinated by shrimps and other creatures, as well as water currents. The seeds are like small pine nuts and many have been placed in their growbags by volunteer schoolchildren. The first green shoots should appear by October.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSeagrass seed pods collected by volunteer divers for Seagrass Ocean Rescue. Photograph: Nina Constable/WWF-UK\nThe huge past losses of seagrass means allowing nature to recolonise the bay in its own time is not an option. “It’s hard for people to understand how screwed the ocean is. It’s out of sight and out of mind,” says Unsworth. “The environment here has got stuck in an anoxic, algae-rich, muddy state. You have to intervene.”\nThe project is the culmination of eight years of laboratory and sea trials and extensive discussions with the local community. “This is perfect habitat, really sheltered, and it’s all coming together here,” he says.\nThe seeds were collected over 300 hours of diving at the few remaining seagrass meadows at theLlŷn peninsula in north Wales and on the coasts of Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. “It’s like underwater blackberry picking,” says Unsworth, describing plucking the “spades” that contain the seeds. The seeds harvested at Llŷn were about 0.05% of the total, so the meadow there was not damaged.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nProject crew and volunteers attach bags of seagrass seed and sand on to ropes ready for planting. Photograph: Joseph Gray/WWF-UK\nAdvertisement\nSeagrass has a high turnover of leaves and the dead ones fall into oxygen-poor sediments below where they trap carbon. The meadows also slow currents, allowing other organic material to drift down and be trapped, potentially for thousands of years.\nThe meadows are also a rich habitat, providing shelter and food for juvenile cod, plaice and other species. The 20,000 square metres being restored in Dale Bay could also support cuttlefish, pipefish and seahorses, and 200 million invertebrates such as the snakelocks anemone, stalked jellyfish and colourful snails.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe seagrass seeds are bagged to prevent them from being dispersed outside of the licensed restoration area and to protect them from being eaten. Photograph: Joseph Gray/WWF-UK\nSeagrass meadows around the world also provide nurseries for a fifth of the world’s biggest fishing species, including pollock, herring and whiting, meaning their restoration can improve catches.\nUnsworth says the process of gathering seeds and planting them could be made less expensive in future with mechanisation. A large restoration project in Chesapeake Bay in the US used underwater equipment akin to combine harvesters to collect seeds and where the currents were favourable, they were able to simply scatter the seeds.\nUK waters are cleaner now following EU water directives in recent decades, Unsworth says: “We want thousands of hectares of seagrass restored and the opportunity exists in this country now. The Stour, Orwell and Humber estuaries, for example. These places are ripe for it.” Next in the team’s sights are locations in North Wales, if funding can be obtained.\nSeagrass can store about half a tonne of carbon per hectare per year, and more when it is mature,” he says. “It could be part of nature-based solutions [to climate change], and a significant part of it.”\nAlec Taylor, WWF’s head of marine policy says: “Seagrass restoration ticks so many boxes: climate, fisheries, water quality, biodiversity. But we will only get the benefits if we act now and at scale.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nProject crew and volunteers carry crates of seeds and sandbags to the shore as the planting day commences. Photograph: Joseph Gray/WWF-UK\nAdvertisement\nWe want the oceans to play a hero’s role” in the fight against global heating, he says. “And we want the UK government to play a hero’s role too.” The UK hosts a crucial UN climate summit in November.\nOne government action would be to make it easier to get permits for restoration. “Officials say it’s a wonderful idea, but when you apply for licensing you are treated as the criminal until you are proven innocent,” says Unsworth. “It’s almost like we are a problem, rather than a solution”\nLooking across Dale Bay, Unsworth concludes: “As a scientist, and as a father, I could spend the next 20 years writing awesome academic papers about seagrass decline, or spend the 20 years doing something about it. We have a responsibility as scientists to act, as well as report.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It started a global conversation about how the voices of black, Asian and minority ethnic people are erased from the climate crisis movement.\nClimate activism has historically been perceived as a white, middle-class pursuit, but nothing could be further from the truth. Across the UK, BAME people are at the forefront of the fight against the climate crisis. Now, their efforts are being recognised by the Climate Reframe Project, an initiative spotlighting BAME voices in climate activism, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Solberga Foundation, and put together by the team behind former Irish president Mary Robinson’s Mothers of Invention podcast. Today, it features a list of the leading figures in the UK, some of whom shared their stories with me.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWhy have BAME activists so often been ignored? “Historically, the environmental movement comes from a white, privileged background,” says Suzanne Dhaliwal, 37, who is researching BAME representation in the climate justice movement at the University of Brighton. “But climate change mostly affects people in the global south, so it’s fair to elevate those voices.”\nMany of the people I speak to have at times felt excluded. Nish Doshi is a 32-year-old climate justice organiser from Edinburgh. When Doshi – who is non-binary, and uses they/them pronouns – goes to Cop26 organising meetings for civil society alongside NGO leaders, they often find they are one of the few BAME people in the room. “There will be 50 or 60 people there, and hardly any people of colour,” they say. “They don’t even think about that at all.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nVanessa Nakate (left) with Greta Thunberg before being cropped out of the image. Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP\nCriticism has also been levelled at Extinction Rebellion (XR), with BAME people pointing out that its tactic of encouraging protesters to get arrested ignores the reality that people of colour are disproportionately likely to be targeted in their interactions with police.\nAdvertisement\nYet BAME people have been central to climate activism for decades. Farhana Yamin, 55, is the international climate lawyer responsible for getting the target of net zero emissions by 2050 included in the Paris accord. She came up with the goal after growing tired of the incremental advances promised by the carbon emission trading system. “I wanted to think bolder and bigger – no more mucking around with carbon budgets,” Yamin says. “These gases are toxic. We shouldn’t create trading systems for toxic pollutants.”\nRecent years have seen the movement work to address its diversity problem. “When Vanessa was cropped out of that photo, that brought about a lot of healthy debate,” says Tyrone Scott, 28, an activist from London. He has been working tirelessly to get younger people into the movement, going into pupil referral units to teach students about the climate emergency. “They are so engaged,” Scott says. “It gives you so much hope for the future.”\nThe 16-year-old Londoner Jessica Ahmed says she used to think: “Climate change doesn’t affect me. It’s not an African-person problem.” But she became an activist after attending the May 2019 school climate strikes. “I’ve never fallen behind with school,” she says. “I think I’m more on track than most people who don’t go on the strikes.” She now organises for the UK Student Climate Network, mobilising her classmates. “It sucks that we have to miss school,” she says. “But we need to make our voices heard because it’s us that are going to be the most affected by climate change.”\nLike Ahmed, the Manchester-based pupil Lillia Adetero, aged 10, has been striking from school, attending the Fridays for Future protests since January 2019. She often gives speeches at these strikes. “I talk about how climate change is going to affect our future and how the government isn’t doing enough,” she says. Adetero was delighted by the court of appeal ruling against the third Heathrow runway. “I’m very happy that Heathrow has been cancelled,” she says. “I’d like them to stop the Manchester airport expansion, too.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTyrone Scott, who stood as a Green party candidate in 2019. Photograph: Provided by Tyrone Scott\nOthers are trying to change the system from within. Scott stood as a Green MP candidate in Hackney South in 2019, doubling the party’s share of the vote. “It was a good experience,” he says. “But I was relieved the day after the election, I’m not going to lie. I was out every day, delivering thousands of leaflets for 10 hours at a time.”\nFatima Ibrahim, 27, from London, is a codirector of the Green New Deal UK, which lobbies for the British government to put the climate crisis at the heart of the economic system, rather than seeing it as a stand-alone issue. “We have an economic system that isn’t working for the climate,” she says. “We need a system-wide change.” Her activism is cutting through: the Green New Deal was included in the 2019 Labour and Green manifestos.\nMany BAME activists feel a connection to the cause because they have family members in the vulnerable global south. Ibrahim is of Somalian heritage; her parents moved to the UK from Canada when she was nine. Climate activism has been her life’s work. “I was that crazy nine-year-old who watched Newsnight,” she says. “Coming from a refugee family made me aware of everything that was going on in the world. And it became clear to me that climate change was the biggest threat to people everywhere. If you care about injustice or refugees, all of those things will be 100 times worse if we don’t deal with the climate crisis.” She sees her Muslim faith as integral to her activism. “I have a responsibility for the people around me and a commitment to my community and other people,” she says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nJessica Ahmed, who attends school climate strikes. Photograph: Helen William/PA\nOther activists have turned to nonviolent direct action to force the government to pay attention. Yamin joined XR after becoming depressed by Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris accord, and the release of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2018 that warned we had only 12 years to avert climate catastrophe. “I fell into a state of real depression – actual depression – which I’d never had before,” says Yamin. “I felt that we had failed. We hadn’t saved the world at all. It felt really bleak.”\nDirect action felt like a necessary corrective. “Our laws were being flouted,” says Yamin. “Laws that I helped put in place were being totally ignored.” She attended a number of XR direct actions. “I tried being arrested a few times and failed,” she jokes. “I thought: ‘I have to work harder at this being-arrested thing.’” Eventually, her wish was granted: Yamin was arrested after gluing herself to the Shell headquarters as part of the April 2019 XR protests.\nBut it’s possible to make a difference in less dramatic ways. “It was amazing,” says 38-year-old Dave Fuller, from London, of his experience cooking for the anti-fracking protesters at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool. “When people are doing frontline work, all they want at the end of the day is a hot meal. I went up worrying that people would feel like I wasn’t fulfilling my part, but everyone was thankful someone was willing to turn up with hot food on a cold day.” He now works for Repowering, an initiative bringing affordable renewable energy to local communities.\nThe law can also be a powerful tool. When Tessa Khan, a 37-year-old lawyer from London, heard about a landmark case brought by 900 Dutch citizens against their government for failing to uphold its climate commitments, she phoned the lawyers working on it. “I thought they were amazing,” says Khan. She went on to cofound the Climate Litigation Network, which helps citizens around the world to sue their governments on climate-crisis-related issues.\nThe climate movement is massively growing. We’re reaching new people\n“The gap between what the governments are supposed to be doing to stop global warming and what they are actually doing is growing by the day,” says Khan. Her team of four lawyers is supporting activists in Ireland who are bringing a case against the government to demand more aggressive action on the climate crisis. “We need to hold governments accountable for the promises they are making,” says Khan. “In our view, it’s unlawful for them to be as deeply negligent as they are.”\nAll the activists I speak to are passionate about amplifying the voices of BAME people. “A big part of what I do is pushing for voices from the global south to be included in the climate change discussion,” says Doshi. They run workshops on climate colonialism and speak at events for youth leadership.\n“We need more black, brown and working-class voices to be heard,” agrees Adetero. “They don’t really get the opportunity to have their voices heard that white people do.”\nThese are challenging times. “I am depressed about things,” says Doshi. “I see Trump pulling out of the Paris accord, the Trans Mountain pipeline in Canada, Bolsonaro taking away indigenous lands in Brazil.” But in spite of everything, there is also hope. “I feel like we have no choice but to be optimistic,” says Ibrahim. “The climate movement is massively growing. We’re reaching new people. The narrative is changing. We have to keep fighting against all odds.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it “Europe’s man on the moon moment”. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic.\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates\nRead more\nNearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution.\nPrevious attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual.\nHow will it work?\nThe green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets – a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core – alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources.\nAdvertisement\nAll of the EU’s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of “50 actions for 2050” for other sectors.\nJobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. “The European green deal is our new growth strategy – a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,” von der Leyen said.\nWhat is the legal basis?\nAll of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals.\nEast European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK – which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda – will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP.\nThe new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill.\nBut what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans – charged with delivering the green deal – will throw all of its might behind the effort. “It’s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,” says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. “It will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWill the green deal make a difference?\nAdvertisement\nIt needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 – good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that – disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key.\nOn other environmental scores, the EU’s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world.\nBut alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: birds, insects, mammals, fish … few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992.\nHow much will it cost and where will the money come from?\nAt least €1 tn (£852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, €503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further €114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states).\nAdvertisement\nThe next €279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel projects.\nOn top of this Brussels has promised a €100bn “just transition” mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories.\nBut is it really €1 tn?\nEven friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels’ figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the €503bn from the EU budget as “green investment”, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to “green” the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU’s auditors highlighted how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out “green” cash with little oversight.\nOthers fear that carbon financiers will game the system, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don’t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four “frugal” net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The €503bn is not even in the bank.\nEven if the EU realised its €1tn plan, it wouldn’t be enough. Bruegel argues the €1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission’s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from Aragón to Silesia.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhy does the green deal matter internationally?\nAdvertisement\nThis year – coronavirus permitting – will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world’s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible.\nBut the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases fell short of what is required to stay below 2C, and since 2015 the world’s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after.\nBut enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from Donald Trump’s US, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.\nThe key player will be China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a pact between the US and China was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone.\n“EU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,” says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. “In the face of Trump’s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world’s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.”\nWhat do critics say?\nThe EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank.\nHe points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. “The AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,” he says.\n“The green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won’t be going carbon-neutral,” says Grant. “This will increase the electoral strength of populists.”\nSome leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the “just transition” mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, wrote in the Guardian: “Will there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.”\nWill the UK be affected?\nAdvertisement\nBoris Johnson’s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain various loopholes that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees.\nThe UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK’s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot.\nOn the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What’s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe’s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift.\nWho are the green agitators in Europe?\nThe idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word “new’ with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement.\nVon der Leyen, a German defence minister, was a surprise choice to become European commission president, leapfrogging candidates who had run in the European elections in May. Those elections resulted in a record number of seats for European Greens, as climate change topped the agenda in Germany and the Nordic countries. Von der Leyen’s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office.\nBeyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet. As one official recounts: “You can imagine a conversation with your own children is much more confrontational than a conversation with a shareholder, or a bad headline in a newspaper.”\nWho’s in favour, who’s against?\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a bit like world peace: everyone backs the European Green Deal, in theory. But there is a big hole in the ambition to be net-zero by 2050: Poland, which says it will reach climate neutrality at “its own pace”.\nAnd beneath the surface, tensions over Europe’s green ambitions are not hard to find. At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhat role will the European parliament play in the green deal?\nEU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament. That gives MEPs a weighty role across a swathe of new laws expected to flow from the European Green Deal: a revision of the EU’s heavily criticised carbon trading scheme, new performance standards for cars and vans, an overhaul of farm policy, changes to EU rules on state subsidies that will phase out support for fossil fuels.\nTypically, the parliament tends to raise the bar on green action – it last year declared a climate emergency. But MEPs often lose the battle against EU ministers, who usually get the upper hand in EU negotiations.\nReading list\nThe European Green Deal, the European commission\nA trillion reasons to scrutinise the Green Deal Investment Plan, Bruegel\nHow good is the European commission’s Just Transition Fund proposal?, Bruegel\nEurope’s Green Deal, Jeffrey Sachs, Project Syndicate\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It took its toll on me and in the end I felt I had to step away. I went into my shell and pretty much turned off my phone for three years.\n“But I’ve got some emotional resilience back now. My partner and I found out we’re pregnant – due in August.

In December, its shares plunged to a 16-year low after the company surprised investors by slashing its production forecasts, scrapping its dividend and announcing that its chief executive and exploration director had left.\nInfluential TV host Jim Cramer said he was 'done with fossil fuels' because they had entered a 'death-knell phase'\nTullow has been plagued by problems in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. It planned to tap the oil-rich reserves off the Guyanese coast but was forced to admit this year that that “transformational” project had turned out to be a damp squib.\nBut the impact of a global oil-market downturn, combined with mounting concerns over global heating, is likely to magnify the existing weaknesses of the company – and many of its peers.\nTullow is one of a handful of exploration and production companies listed on the UK’s premium stock markets that are entirely exposed both to the short-term pain of the coronavirus outbreak and the long-term existential risk of the climate crisis.\nAdvertisement\nThe market has been particularly unforgiving for Premier Oil, which faces a $4bn debt refinancing and has suffered a precipitous plunge in market value, from more than 117p a share at the start of the year to about 62p last week.\nThe combination of weak oil prices and wary investor sentiment means there has never been a worse time to be reliant on fossil fuels and saddled with debt. Oil industry brokers at Peel Hunt slashed their share price targets for companies across the sector late last week. On average, the valuation of all listed oil companies in its sights have fallen by about 15%.\nThe world’s oil supermajors – Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Repsol – may be able to keep investors on side by charting a greener future, but UK oil companies such as Tullow, Premier Oil and EnQuest have fewer options, and limited capital, available to weather the coming storm.\nBlackrock, the world’s biggest hedge fund and Tullow’s fifth-largest investor, made its position on fossil fuel investment clear earlier this month. Larry Fink, the boss of the $7tn fund, said the climate emergency was altering how investors viewed the long-term prospects of companies and warned of a “significant reallocation of capital”.\nWeeks later, Jim Cramer, the influential host of the US investment television show Mad Money, said he was “done with fossil fuels” because they had entered a “death-knell phase”.\nThis is worrying news for the UK’s mid-tier oilers, and leaves zero room for missteps.\nWhile we have you ...\n... we’re asking readers like you to make a contribution in support of our independent journalism.

And it said it would install fast-charging equipment for electric vehicles at 12 sites this year.\nThe government also announced a review of what would need to be done to reach net zero emissions before 2050.\nThe Liberal administration in question was not the Morrison government in Canberra, where the climate policy debate remains focused on the cost of acting above all else, but the Tasmanian state government in Hobart.\nPeter Gutwein, a long-time treasurer who became Tasmanian premier in January after the surprise resignation of Will Hodgman, used his first “state of the state” address to set out what, by national standards, were a striking series of commitments that could put the state at the forefront of the shift to an emissions-free world.\nNew Liberal premier of Tasmania Peter Gutwein says we must ‘do more’ on climate change\nRead more\nGutwein, who has retained responsibility for treasury and also taken on the climate change portfolio, said it was time for the state to “showcase our innovation to the world and stake our claim as a renewables powerhouse”.\n“Tasmania has the opportunity to ensure that the most compelling 21st century competitive advantage that industry and consumers want – renewable energy – underpins our economy,” he said.\nTasmania starts well ahead of other Australian states in the shift to low emissions. It mostly runs on clean hydro power and has already reached 100% renewable energy generation in some years. But analysts said, if delivered, the shift in Tasmania could provide an example for others to follow.\nAnna Skarbek, chief executive of research organisation ClimateWorks, said the new Tasmanian commitments were consistent with what other countries and jurisdictions that ran on hydro were doing. They are also in line with what analysts have found: that Australia had great potential to be a clean energy industrial hub.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHydro-scheme water pipes plunge into the valley of the River Nive in Tasmania. Photograph: Lyndall Hawke/AAP\n“It is a good example of a government looking at opportunities for future clean energy markets,” Skarbek said. “What we’ve found is, when the intent is signalled, international technology providers are looking for opportunities to invest in other jurisdictions.”\nThe most fleshed-out element of the Tasmanian commitment is a promise to offer $50m in funding, concessional loans, subsidised power and tax breaks for green hydrogen development over the next decade. Making hydrogen is an electricity-hungry process that involves using an electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.\nWith a report for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency having estimated an Australian industry could be worth up to $10bn a year by 2040, Gutwein said hydrogen was “one of the most extraordinary sunrise opportunities Tasmania could ever step into”.\nHe said the state had already received interest from companies in Japan, Korea and Singapore, and cited forecasts hydrogen produced with clean power would have about a 15% price advantage over fossil fuel-derived hydrogen. “We know that with our renewable energy that we can generate green hydrogen cheaper than what they will be able to on the mainland,” he said.\nThe other elements Gutwein announced remain little more than dot points. He has promised a renewable energy action plan in April, and a plan in the state budget for the government to have more electric cars in its fleet.\nLocally, the commitments received a largely, but not universally, positive response. Politically, Tasmanian Labor said they were welcome but long overdue; the Greens said they were welcome but nothing like enough to take the climate emergency seriously, and said they would introduce a bill that would go further.\nOutside parliament, the Wilderness Society described the new pledges as refreshing, while the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, said the green hydrogen vision was a “forward thinking plan for the state”.\n“It’s great to see the Tasmanian government backing our renewable energy sector by investing in this emerging industry,” said Leanne Minshull, the Australia Institute’s Tasmanian director.\n'Extinction is a choice’: Margaret Atwood on Tasmania's forests and saving the swift parrot\nRead more\nBut both organisations had caveats. Minshull said the massive clean energy expansion should be used to drive Tasmania to zero emissions, including by moving the state’s vehicles and farms to running on electricity and attracting further clean industries to the state, before more was exported to the mainland via new undersea cables, including the proposed Marinus Link with Victoria.\nTom Allen, from the Wilderness Society, said the state’s first step in cutting emissions should be to end native forest logging. He said the government still intended to log 226 forest reserves that contained more than 10m tonnes of carbon.\n“If this logging happens it would obliterate all the environmental policies he announced this week,” he said. “The quickest, easiest, lowest-cost way to boost Tasmania’s carbon stocks, protect wildlife and provide new, badly needed nature recreation spaces is to permanently protect these outstanding reserves.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The European commission stopped short of proposals to phase out combustion engine vehicles and has plans to consult on whether to include vehicles in its carbon-pricing scheme.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nEdward Collins, a director at InfluenceMap, said the document “represents yet another evidence piece” of ExxonMobil’s long-term strategy of delaying climate action by focusing on “long-term technical solutions” to try to avert “decisive regulatory action” that is urgently required to tackle the climate crisis.\nA Guardian investigation last year found that Exxon has spent €37.2m (£32.4m) lobbying the EU since 2010, more than any other major oil company, according to the EU’s transparency register. It revealed that Shell spent €36.5m and BP spent €18.1m lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy.\nExxon is also facing legal action in the US courts after accusations that it misled investors over the business risks caused by regulations aimed at addressing the climate crisis.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nThe lawsuit claims that Exxon scientists told the company’s management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for increasing the levels of carbon in the atmosphere that lead to global heating. In 1981, an internal company memo warned that “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.\nExxon’s latest lobbying efforts have surfaced after documents emerged earlier this year showing that BP successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law to clear the way for fossil fuel projects to move forward.\nA spokesman for ExxonMobil said the company “complies fully” with the EU’s transparency rules and supports the Paris climate agreement. He added that Exxon, “like many companies”, had “a responsibility” to engage in a public policy dialogue that impacted its business.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Many of capitalism’s cruelties, from housing crises and crumbling public amenities to increasingly precarious forms of employment, are most visible in towns and cities. But it’s also in these places that new movements are emerging and rebuilding politics from the bottom up. In cities such as Barcelona, Amsterdam, Berlin and Naples, local activists are defending human rights and public services against a rising tide of anti-immigrant xenophobia and fiscal austerity. We call these urban movements “municipalism”.\nBy achieving small victories around the world, municipalist movements are proving that there is another way of doing politics – one that begins in the places closest to us. It’s thanks to this movement that someone such as me, a woman from a working-class family who began my political career as a housing activist, can today govern a city such as Barcelona. A tide of municipal movements connects cities across the world, creating networks of alliances and shared objectives. Together, we have put pressure on our national governments and demanded greater powers to fight gentrification, increase the stock of affordable housing, and safeguard our collective right to the city.\nAdvertisement\nIn Barcelona we have curbed the Airbnb rentals that drive up demand for a limited housing supply, and have repossessed unused housing owned by banks. The city of Berlin has pledged to freeze rents for five years in an effort to halt gentrification. New York City has promised to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and to sue oil companies for their contribution to global warming. These small victories show that alternatives to our dominant economic system are within reach – and that cities are a key part of this future.\nThis doesn’t mean urban politics is without challenges. There’s a risk that we’ll be reduced to resolving quotidian problems and fall short of our ambition to confront systemic crises. Though cities will be central to the transition towards a fossil fuel-free future, the climate emergency doesn’t respect borders, and demands networked, international solutions. For this reason, it’s crucial that the climate emergency declarations made in cities including Barcelona, Amsterdam and New York transcend mere symbolic gestures – and that we hold our national leaders to account.\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates\nRead more\nWhat does municipalism have to do with the future of Europe? Everything. Europe has been immersed in a crisis of legitimacy for the past decade. The EU has functioned as a single market, but not as a joint democratic project. It has suffered from a lack of citizen participation, with a distanced parliament and a cruel migration policy that has violated human rights and betrayed the principles of solidarity agreed by Europe’s leaders in the wake of the second world war. Part of our work in Barcelona has been to develop an approach to migration that protects the rights of residents in our city, and their access to public services, regardless of their immigration status. We firmly believe that border crossings should be places of meeting and welcome, not of death.\nEurope can only be strong if it is capable of reinventing itself from the bottom up. To secure its future, Europe must recommit itself to its founding values: the guarantee of human rights and democracy. Today, the politics of hate and xenophobia are the main threats to the values that the EU once espoused. We urgently need to avert their spread and build societies that are fair, inclusive and diverse. The municipal movements in cities across Europe are already building networks of solidarity that will be essential in fighting the political forces threatening the union, and in resisting the siren call of the far right. It is my deep conviction that there is no greater power than that which is built by people working together at the grassroots, and that our neighbourhoods, towns and cities are the only places where this can happen.\n• Ada Colau is the mayor of Barcelona\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Food was rationed in the UK, but children were given personal points that were saved towards a bar of chocolate once a month. At my school, some of us started collecting our chocolate bars so they could be taken by relief workers and given to German children who were, at that time, literally starving.\nLiving through the war gave me a sense of the change people were willing to accept when they felt they were working towards a common good. Within a period of months, people had to learn to deal with rationing of food and clothes, and there was suddenly no petrol for private vehicles. Hitchhiking became respectable – my parents, who had owned a car before the war, were happy to thumb a lift. That’s the degree of urgency we need to see now in response to the climate crisis.\nAdvertisement\nIn the 70s, I became a member of the Conservation Society, an early British environmental organisation. My wife, Monica, and I fostered a dozen children over the years and adopted six of them. I now have 31 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren, which helps focus my mind on the future. After retiring from my job as a university lecturer in the 90s, I spent time in the Middle East in refugee camps and villages, where the consequences of a well running dry can be devastating, so I know what’s coming.\nLike most people, I became aware of Extinction Rebellion after seeing news reports about their activities. I learned last year that my local XR group in Hastings was going to be staging a series of die-ins across the town, went along and was made very welcome. The event involved a group of us lying down in various public locations, sometimes arranged in a circle holding hands. The young people involved seemed impressed that I was taking part at 91, though there were other pensioners there, and wheelchair users, too.\nSign up to hear about our weekend newspapers\nRead more\nOn marches, I carry a fisherman’s stool in a pack on my back, so I always have something to sit on; I have arthritis and don’t find it easy to stand for long. I’m never without a flask, either. If you’re drinking tea, it’s unlikely anyone is going to think you’re about to start a riot. It’s a technique I learned in Hebron, where I spent time acting as a human rights observer after Monica died in 1999. It’s a real trouble spot, but I got into the habit of buying an ice-cream whenever I was about to approach a checkpoint while escorting children to school – it demonstrated I wasn’t a threat.\nI’ve been arrested more times than I can remember over the years. Three years ago, I was charged with aggravated trespass after superglueing myself to another arms trade protester outside the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Burghfield. The most recent arrests occurred during XR events. I was blocking lorries with other older protesters near the docks in Dover; the intention was to draw attention to the danger of extreme food shortages. A couple of weeks later, during the fortnight of direct action in London last year, I was arrested outside the Cabinet Office in Whitehall for refusing to move when asked by police. People online called me a hero afterwards, but that’s just silly. I’m living alone, I’ve got a pension; if you think of the youngsters who’ve got a job to lose, who have a mortgage or rent to pay, along with all the anxieties associated with being arrested in your 20s, that’s a very different order of magnitude.\nExperience: I’ve written a letter to my local paper every day for 40 years\nRead more\nI have family members all over the country and some of them take part in XR marches and protests, too. None of them has any great concern about my activities, despite my age. After all, I’ve worked in places where the police and armed forces can be quite trigger-happy. I’ve been told I’m the oldest XR protester; there are so many of us across the country now that I don’t know if there’s any proof of that, though I certainly seem to be the oldest member who’s been taken into custody.\nAdvertisement\nI think Extinction Rebellion have taken a really hopeful step; it’s inspiring to see a movement so driven by young people. It’s important my generation are involved, too – many older people are feeling compelled to protest for the first time and youngsters need to see that happening. After all, our generation is the one that created this crisis. We have a particular responsibility.\n• As told to Chris Broughton\nDo you have an experience to share?

She thinks you should be too.\nShe was traveling in 2017 when Donald Trump made plans to announce the US withdrawal from the pact. Perched at the end of her hotel bed with pen and paper, she decided to write down each correct statement she heard.\n“The speech finished and my piece of paper was completely blank,” Figueres told the Guardian in an interview. “There was not a sentence uttered in that whole speech that was correct, true or even informed.”\nWith tiny silver frogs dangling from her ears and strung around her neck, the small-framed Figueres is animated as she recalls the story, alternately pushing back in her chair and lowering her head toward her crossed arms.\nTrump gave his remarks in the White House Rose Garden, a venue typically reserved for major events.\n“My first thought was the poor roses, they had to listen to all this,” Figueres said.\nFigueres, who was executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, could easily be swallowed up by her anger at the intensifying climate crisis. But instead she has become an advocate for positivity about climate action.\nDespite Trump’s planned withdrawal, not a single nation has followed suit. Countries that agreed to the Paris deal, however, are not on track to fulfill their obligations. And, even if they were, their actions wouldn’t be enough to stall significant global warming.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nFigueres and her former senior advisor Tom Rivett-Carnac, who was once a Buddhist monk, have written a book they pitch as “surprisingly optimistic”. It’s titled The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis, and it offers two contrasting visions for how the world might look in 30 years. They also have a podcast, called Outrage and Optimism.\nRivett-Carnac said people can be upset and positive at the same time.\n“We see this form of stubborn optimism as a way of changing the world,” he said. It’s not like we wake up every morning thinking, ‘everything’s ok, don’t worry.’”\nFigueres argues that society is “paralyzed and obsessed about the consequences of climate change,” and hasn’t been able to separate that fear from the upsides of cutting the fossil fuel and other emissions heating the planet.\nShe lists the possible benefits: stronger economies, energy independence, a livable environment, breathable air, less time wasted commuting, improved health, an increased connection to nature, and “on and on,” she says.\nTrump believes the Paris deal would sink the US economy. In Figueres’ mind, if there was any country aware of the growth opportunities from addressing the climate crisis, it was the US.\n“There was hardly any country that had actually gone into such an analysis of the text,” she said. “Frankly, there was barely a country that contributed as much to the text … It’s very sad when you basically cut your nose off to spite your face.”\nShe said “the sad thing is that the US has become irrelevant in the most consequential challenge that humanity has faced,” clarifying that she meant the federal government, and not the states, localities and businesses that have stepped up to make their own pledges in its place.\nThe book and podcast come as eco-anxiety is growing, particularly among younger people.\nNearly half of US adults under the age of 35 say stress about climate change affects their lives, according to a poll by the American Psychological Association. Among all adults, seven in 10 say they wish they could do more to combat climate change, but 51% say they don’t know where to start.\nFigueres wants those people to take their power back.\n“We would say what makes you feel better quickly is actually to engage in a positive contribution so that you bust through this myth that individual actions don’t count And you begin to realize the world is only made out of individual actions,” she said. “It does count.

It plans to produce 330,000 vehicles a year by 2021.\nThe cars are capable of travelling for 205-340 miles on a single charge, and Smith believes the deal with British Gas could “give customers even more confidence, as they make the switch to emission-free driving”.\nThe collaboration could help British Gas fend off rising competition from a string of challenger brands by relying more on energy services such as boiler repairs, insurance cover and home car charging to generate revenue.\nThe agreement with VW comes less than a year after the owner of British Gas, Centrica, struck a deal with Ford to market its car chargers and EV-charging tariffs from US carmaker’s forecourts across the UK.\nA similar strategy is being pursued by Ovo Energy, the UK’s second-largest energy supplier, and Scottish Power, which have both collaborated with Nissan on small-scale deals to help install compatible home chargers for its Nissan Leaf model.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nCentrica is under pressure to prove to shareholders that its strategy will pay off, after reporting a loss of more than £1bn for 2019, after the government’s energy price cap cut earnings at British Gas to all-time lows.\nThe chief executive, Iain Conn, is to step down this year and the company is yet to announce a successor.\nSarwjit Sambhi, the head of Centrica’s consumer business, said it was committed to finding “a pathway for the energy transition”, which is in line with the Paris agreement by “helping our customers reduce their emissions, reducing the emissions of the energy system as a whole, and reducing our own”.\n“We made material progress on all of these during 2019 and are committed to a plan for delivering net zero by 2050,” he said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

That’s absolutely a priority,” he said. The climate law was “so important”, because “it allows you to focus on other things without losing track of what you need to do to reach climate neutrality”.\n“Even if the Eye of Sauron is on something else for a bit, the trajectory to 2050 will be clear,” he said, in a reference to the dark forces in the Lord of the Rings. “Because we discipline ourselves with the climate law.”\nSpeaking to the Guardian and six other European newspapers shortly before the law was published, Timmermans said the proposal was revolutionary because all EU legislation would have to be in line with net zero emissions by the mid-century.\nEven before the text was officially released, the climate activist Greta Thunberg and teenage school strike leaders across Europe gave a blistering verdict, accusing the commission of ignoring climate science.\nThunberg, who is meeting Von der Leyen, Timmermans and the rest of the commission’s top team, described the law as “surrender”. In an open letter, she said it failed to respect the goal of capping global heating at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – an aspiration the EU signed up to in the 2015 Paris agreement.\nAdvertisement\nShe repeated that message at a meeting with MEPs on the European parliament’s environment committee on Wednesday. “In November 2019 the European parliament declared a climate and environment emergency,” she said. “You stated that yes, the house is actually burning, this was no false alarm, but then you went back inside, finished your dinner and watched your movie and went to bed without even calling the fire department.\n“When your house is on fire you don’t wait a few more years to start putting it out, and yet this is what the commission are proposing today.”\nEarlier at a private meeting with EU commissioners the teenage activist was told by Timmermans that the movement she started was the reason the European Green Deal and climate law exists.\nQ&A\nWhat is the EU climate law?\nShow\nEuropean Union leaders in 2019 agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning more emissions will be removed than expelled into the atmosphere.\nThe climate law proposed by the European commission makes that 2050 promise legally-binding. If an EU member state fails to make progress, the commission can take it to the European court of justice, which has the power to impose hefty daily fines for non-compliance.\nThe commission, the body that drafts and enforces EU law, describes the draft regulation as revolutionary, because all EU legislation – whether farming, energy or transport – will have to be consistent with the 2050 climate target.\nClimate campaigners, notably Greta Thunberg who described the law as “surrender”, argue that it does not go far enough to reduce emissions in the next decade – a critical window if the world is to avoid climate breakdown that will come from overshooting the aspiration agreed at the 2015 Paris climate talks to keep warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The climate law does not include an emissions-reduction target for 2030, although the commission will table a proposal in September.\nEU governments are likely to object to the powers the commission wants to give itself to propose climate targets for 2035, 2040 and 2045. Under the powerful legal tool of “delegated acts”, the EU executive would be able to set targets with limited input from ministers and MEPs. That could prove tricky with governments and the European parliament, who must approve the climate law before it comes into force.\nWas this helpful?\nThe climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the EU was aiming too low and its current targets on reducing emissions set in 2014 were not in line with the 1.5C goal.\nAn IPCC report in 2018 showed that going beyond 1.5C, even by half a degree, would significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.\nVan Ypersele said the EU should be aiming for carbon neutrality one decade earlier. “If a region as technologically rich, as scientifically rich as the EU is only able to achieve that by 2050 how can you imagine that the rest of the world will do that by the same year? I don’t think it’s very likely.”\nA dozen EU member states have also voiced reservations about Timmermans’ timetable for proposing an EU climate target for 2030, widely seen as a crucial goal if the world is not to exceed its carbon budget.\nTimmermans plans to set out the EU’s 2030 goal in September, but the dozen countries argue this is too late to galvanise the rest of the world to make commitments at crucial UN climate talks in Glasgow at the end of the year.\nThe vice-president rejected these arguments, saying his officials needed the summer to do a thorough impact assessment of the 2030 goal. “If the commission were to come out with a not duly assessed number we would have months and months of discussion about a percentage and then the EU would not have a position either.”\nHe said the EU’s 2030 target would be in time for the EU to have a position at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow.\nTimmermans also voiced confidence in the British government’s preparations for Cop26. Campaigners have been concerned about a shaky start, with the new Cop26 president – the business secretary, Alok Sharma – only appointed three weeks ago, after his predecessor was abruptly sacked. The UK has yet to set out a strategy or timetable for the cconference, widely seen as critical to getting the world back on track with the 2015 Paris goals.\nQ&A\nThis is Europe: a new Guardian series\nShow\nThis is Europe is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we.\nPhotograph: Guardian Design\nWas this helpful?\n“The UK has formidable capacities in this area,” he said, adding that Brexit had not created a rift between the EU and UK over climate goals. “Brexit weakens the EU, full stop. And, in my view, weakens the UK, full stop,” he said. “I don’t see any object of discord, or disagreement or confrontation between EU and United Kingdom on this issue, of making a success of Glasgow.”\nBut he is likely to face a tougher response from governments in central and eastern Europe that are wary of rapid action on the climate emergency, especially Poland, which generates 80% of its electricity from coal.\nThe climate law means governments failing to meet targets could be taken to the European court of justice and fined.\nTimmermans said “the hardest, hardest thing we will have to do” is guaranteeing that the European Green Deal will benefit the whole of society.\nHe said he was angered by claims that tackling climate change was against the poor, while acknowledging that a failure to benefit everyone carried risks. “If we are not able to show that it is done in a fair way more and more people will say no, we will give food to extremist parties, who will try to demonstrate that this is only a plan for Tesla-driving tofu eaters.\n“But the real victims of the climate crisis will be the poorest people in society.

Finance is currently funding warming of more than 4C, which represents an existential threat not only to finance and the economy, but to life on earth.\n“With less than a decade to drastically cut emissions and avoid irreversible climate breakdown, Andrew Bailey must ensure that climate remains high on the Bank’s agenda.

On the guest list, the environment minister of Croatia, current holders of the EU’s rotating presidency, and Guido Bortoni, an adviser in the European commission’s energy directorate. Nobody at all from civil society or the NGO sector. In other words a perfect Brussels lobbying event.\nBilled as “Oil and Gas and the Green Deal” this dinner took place on 17 February, just a fortnight before the unveiling of the EU’s first ever climate law. The meal was sponsored by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), which represents 29 of Europe’s main fossil fuel operators, including Total, Shell, BP and ExxonMobil.\nAccording to the EU transparency register the IOGP spent €350,160 in 2018 lobbying in Brussels, so it can afford to take a few MEPs out to dinner. The European Energy Forum (EEF) is the perfect organiser: it is headed by Jerzy Buzek, an MEP for the European People’s party (EPP), a former prime minister of Poland, a former president of the European parliament and currently chair of its industry research and energy committee. The forum boasts 82 associate members, firms that pay “at least” €7,000 a year in membership fees. Predictably they are all in the oil and gas sector.\nThe EEF politely turned down a media request to attend an earlier gathering on 26 November entitled “Gas: Driving the Energy Transition”. “We do not accept journalists at our events,” was the response. The event was sponsored by Eurogas, the gas industry’s main lobbying organisation, and two German firms, Uniper and Wintershall. An official from the European commissions DG Energy also attended.\nThe European Green Deal, the commission’s €1tn plan to prepare the European economy for confronting the climate crisis, has prompted a round of intensive lobbying activity. “Since 2010, the five main oil and gas corporations and their fossil fuel lobby groups have spent at least a quarter of a billion euros buying influence at the heart of European decision-making,” claims a report produced by a coalition of climate NGOs (Corporate Europe Observatory, Food & Water Europe, Friends of the Earth Europe and Greenpeace).\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates\nRead more\nSuch firms, their business founded on extracting fossil fuels, have an interest in delaying or undermining policies designed to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. They make much use of Brussels-based thinktanks such as the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS). A week before the newly sworn-in commission presented its climate policies, CEPS hosted on 4 December, a “by invitation-only” event on the Green Deal funded by Equinor and Fortum, the energy market leaders in Norway and Finland, respectively.\nFirms are welcome to join CEPS as corporate members. ExxonMobil, for example, pays €15,000 a year for this access. The thinktank has organised members-only breakfast meetings with guests such as Frans Timmermans, now EU commissioner in charge of the Green Deal.\nMembers of commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s team have been the focus of relentless attention from energy industry and particularly gas lobbyists for months. In the last 10 days of January alone, Eurogas representatives met six commissioners and officials from departments for the environment, trade, budget, agriculture and economic affairs. Each time the declared business of the meeting was the Green Deal.\nThe energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, will be the keynote speaker at this year’s Eurogas conference on 19 March in Brussels. Six members of the association’s staff are accredited for access to EU parliament buildings. Eurogas spent €800,000 on lobbying in 2018 alone. “DG Energy is very permeable to the gas lobby,” says Pascal Canfin, a Renew Europe MEP and chair of the parliament’s environment committee.\nThe IOGP has been busy too. On 17 December it met Ditte Juul Jorgensen, the head of DG Energy, then in January two other European commission members, in different directorates. The topic was of course the Green Deal.\nSimilarly employers’ group Business Europe has shown great interest in the commission’s new plans for the environment. Speakers at the federation’s annual gathering on 4 March – the day the EU’s new climate law is being unveiled – include Von der Leyen in person, two of her vice-presidents and three commissioners.\nAnother means of influencing European policymakers is to use lobbying firms. FTI Consulting is one of the most effective. Transparency International ranked it second for setting up meetings with the EU executive in 2018.\nWith 38 staff members accredited for access to the European parliament FTI billed Eurogas, then a new customer, between €25,000 and €50,000 in 2018. Earnings from ExxonMobil, its second largest account totalled €600,000 to €700,000. The same year it carried out confidential research for Gas Infrastructure Europe. Measures for a Sustainable Gas Storage Market, the resulting study, was subsequently posted and is still on the European commission’s website. The firm has made good use of the many revolving doors available in Brussels. In 2016-18, for instance, Philip Lowe, after heading DG Energy (2010-14), was a senior adviser to FTI on public affairs.\nAdvertisement\nJean-Arnold Vinois is another example of the revolving doors in operation. He is an energy policy adviser at the Jacques Delors Institute, a well known thinktank, but also an honorary director for energy at the commission and a consultant at FleishmanHillard, another big lobbying outfit in Brussels. This firm counts the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) – earning it almost €1m in 2018 – the gas lobby Gas Naturally (€25,000 to €50,000) and Fuels Europe, another oil and gas federation, among its customers.\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is the gas industry’s latest hobby-horse, seen as a means of justifying its fossil fuel activities. The snag is that CCS technology is far from being ready for widespread use and even if research succeeds in perfecting the techniques, a drastic reduction in emissions will still be needed over the next 20 years. The gas industry nevertheless persists in promoting it as a solution. Eurogas is working hand-in-hand with the Global CCS Institute, the key lobby in this field. On 18 February, in partnership with the United Kingdom Mission to the EU, it held a conference on the topic in Brussels. It is particularly difficult to pin down the role of EU governments in advancing the interests of their firms. There is no equivalent to the EU transparency register to keep track of the national governments or their missions.\nIndustry is by no means alone in attempting to influence EU lawmakers on climate issues. Powerful environmental thinktanks and NGOs – such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Transport & Environment, the Climate Action Network or the European Climate Foundation (ECF) – are hard at work too. Their financial means are substantial but less than their opponents. In 2018 the ECF reported expenditure of between €500,000 and €600,000, while WWF spent €2.2m to €2.4m over the same period.\nAude Massiot writes for Libération on environment issues.

The new law would enshrine a 2050 net zero emissions target in legislation and empower Brussels to take governments to court if they fail to comply. But the UK prime minister has yet to articulate a strategy for meeting Britain’s target of net zero by 2050, giving the advocates of delay and distraction everything to play for.\nClimate denial is taking new forms, some experts say, moving from an outright rejection of science to covert attacks on green policies and spending on efforts to cut carbon. The EU’s green deal has prompted frantic lobbying in Brussels by powerful fossil fuel interests, as a Guardian collaboration with other European media organisations this week reveals.\nBut the Tory party retains links with prominent individuals who are climate deniers, or who are connected to organisations that either deny the climate crisis or actively work to undermine climate policies, such as the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the thinktank set up by the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson.\n“The GWPF have shown themselves to be tremendous opportunists,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics. Ward claims the thinktank has been fundraising heavily in the US – as well as spreading its views to ministers and across Whitehall – to raise money for a major campaign to influence the Johnson government.\nAdvertisement\n“I expect that as the economy continues to take a hit from Brexit that the GWPF will attempt to mislead policymakers into believing the cause is climate policy.”\nSir Michael Hintze, a hedge fund billionaire who is a long-time major donor to the Tory party, is understood to be a funder of the GWPF, which is not required to disclose its funding, and is also understood to have provided support to Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, among other Tory MPs. Matt Hancock has accepted donations from Ian Taylor, the chairman of oil trader Vitol, while Michael Gove and Liz Truss have been linked to the the American Enterprise Institute, which lobbies political, business and public opinion against action on the climate crisis.\nThere is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of the Tory MPs. However, in the current climate crisis, experts have raised questions about the Tories accepting funds from individuals with fossil fuel interests or linked to climate denial organisations.\n“Well-connected climate sceptics must be called out by ministers, from the prime minister down,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “We have seen the damage that well-funded rightwing campaigns against climate action have done in the US, Australia and Brazil. Conservative environmentalism is stronger than ever, with the party officially recognising the seriousness of the climate emergency. It should disassociate itself from the deniers.”\nQ&A\nThis is Europe: a new Guardian series\nShow\nThis is Europe is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we.\nPhotograph: Guardian Design\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nThis year’s UN talks on the climate are the most important since the Paris agreement in 2015, as the world is now far adrift of the Paris goals. The Cop26 summit set for Glasgow in November is seen as a last chance to get back on track to avoid climate breakdown, but the UK will face an uphill struggle to bring other countries on board with strong new carbon-cutting commitments. That will not be helped by any perception that the Tory party is sympathetic to, or funded by, climate sceptics and deniers, and fossil fuel interests, experts told the Guardian.\nJohnson should claim the mantle of Margaret Thatcher, advised Mohamed Adow, the director of developing country thinktank Power Shift Africa, and a longtime observer of the UN climate talks. “[Cop26] is an opportunity for Johnson to show that he’s broken with those dinosaurs of the past, and is instead showing that tackling climate change transcends tribal politics. His predecessor Margaret Thatcher was the first western leader to give a speech on climate change at the UN, so he won’t be the first Tory to show leadership on this issue,” he said.\nOther countries would be watching closely, warned Adow: “It is a problem that the Conservatives are so closely linked to discredited organisations like the GWPF. If Britain is going to be taken seriously by the rest of the world, [the Conservative party] should distance itself from these shady groups who try to undermine efforts to address the climate crisis.”\nAs well as disavowal of denialist arguments, Johnson must set out clear measures to fulfil the UK’s own climate goals, added Alasdair Cameron of Friends of the Earth. “The voices of denial or delay are obviously scrabbling to stay relevant, but in truth are fading fast,” he said.\nAdvertisement\n“However, it will not be enough for government to simply accept that there is a problem. The UK has the opportunity to be a leader in building a positive zero-carbon future, but it will require urgent and concerted action at home and abroad, and right across government.”\nDoug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace, said that although the government was espousing green policies, it was inconsistent. “Inside the Boris Johnson government, climate denial seems to have morphed into something else – a form of cognitive dissonance. It’s the contrast between acknowledging that there’s a climate emergency and keeping expanding fossil fuel exploration, funding oil and gas projects overseas, and spending billions on new roads. This way of thinking is ultimately on a collision course with reality.”\nJohnson has made only one public appearance on Cop26 so far this year, attending the launch in front of a group of schoolchildren and more than 100 dignitaries. But the event was overshadowed by criticism of Johnson by Claire O’Neill, the former energy minister who was to be Cop26 president but was abruptly sacked a few days before.\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian’s email updates\nRead more\nShe accused Johnson of a lack of knowledge and commitment on the climate crisis. She was replaced last month by Alok Sharma, the new business secretary. Some green campaigners are concerned that his dual role will create a conflict of interest and prevent him from standing up to vested interests reluctant to move urgently to a low-carbon economy.\nHintze said in a statement from his spokesman: “I believe that the increase in concentration of carbon dioxide is in part due to human activity over the past century and that it has been a cause of global warming. But the sole focus on CO2 is too narrow and there are many contributors that need to be considered. All sides must be heard to reach the right conclusion for society as a whole.”\nBenny Peiser, the director of the GWPF, said the organisation was always fundraising, but did not disclose its donors. He said Cop26 was unlikely to make much progress: “The international community is deeply split on this and I do not expect anything more than a continuation of the deadlock.”\nA Conservative party spokesperson said: “Tackling climate change is one of the Conservative party’s top priorities, and this government is working tirelessly day in, day out to achieve our ambitious targets.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In the past 10 years, the former civil servant has quietly steered the UK to its first climate legislation, and then to the policy framework responsible for creating Britain’s cleanest electricity system since the 1880s. As the new chief executive of Ofgem, Brearley plans to inject climate action into the core of the UK’s energy regulation, too.\nThis may prove his toughest challenge yet.\nLet’s enjoy some good climate news: the block on UK onshore wind farms is no more\nMax Wakefield\nRead more\nBrearley’s first task as Ofgem’s new boss was to answer critics who claimed the watchdog was out of touch with the UK’s “net zero” agenda because its rigorous checks and balances were founded upon the duty to protect customers, not the environment. In the balancing act between ambitious green spending and home energy bills, many companies feared that Ofgem would err on the side of short-term savings.\nBrearley’s nine-point plan to prioritise climate action seeks to prove the doubters wrong.\nAdvertisement\n“We take net zero very seriously, and as seriously as our other objectives. What you will see is us making sure that this is factored into all our decisions in quite a fundamental way.”\nBrearley joined the energy regulator in April 2018 to lead Ofgem’s energy networks team after stints within government building the foundations of Britain’s clean energy system. First, as the lead director behind the UK’s first climate legislation, the 2008 Climate Change Act, then as the architect of the government’s clean energy reform, which ignited a swing from fossil fuels to green electricity.\nHis wide-ranging green strategy aims to help get 10m electric vehicles on our roads by 2030 and support a fourfold increase in offshore wind generation and a shift towards low-carbon heating. Ofgem is still committed to keeping a lid on energy bills, but will also lead a crackdown on “greenwash” energy deals and push for new tariffs that encourage homes to help balance the energy system.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBrearley plans a rewiring of the energy regulator itself, too. He says Ofgem’s 1,000-strong workforce plans to “get out of the building” and beyond the routine box-ticking required of every industry regulator.\n“We know we need to be faster moving, more engaged with the world that we’re working in, and these things will be part of what we’ll do as we change over the next few years.”\nHe admits there are “absolutely” tensions between plans for a bold, green future and the need to safeguard vulnerable homes, which risk being left behind.\nThis challenge may prove greater for Brearley than his predecessors. The pace of change in the energy market will mean more investment in a low-carbon energy system, paid for through energy bills, as well as a rush of disruptive new technologies and companies into the market.\nBrearley keeps one particular customer in mind. She is of retirement age, living in social housing, and was being overcharged hundreds of pounds by her existing energy supplier. It took almost six months to fix the problem with the help of an energy adviser at a charity.\n“Two things struck me when I met her,” says Brearley. “The first is how much of a struggle it was for her to fix something which represented an important amount of money in her life. But the second was that when I asked her if she planned to switch away from her supplier she said she wouldn’t – because she’s just not comfortable choosing a new supplier.”\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nAdvertisement\n“There are people who are poised to benefit from changes in the energy system, but those who will find it difficult. That means making decisions which are based on the investment that we need to get to net zero, but also how we can share those costs out in a way that’s fair,” Brearley says.\nIn the past, Ofgem has been criticised for overseeing “rip-off” energy deals and poor customer service from suppliers, while network companies profiteered at the expense of rising bills.\nBrearley says Ofgem “will be less afraid of stepping in where we feel that customers are being harmed” and will “be driving a very hard bargain” with energy network owners.\n“I’m sure at some point these companies will claim that they can’t make investments without higher rates of return. Our job is to stick to the evidence, to stand firm, and get what we think is a fair deal for customers,” Brearley says.\n“I am very clear that we won’t make this transition to net zero if customers feel ripped-off.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Is everyone going to die? Questions that come up a bit in our house, from a concerned eight-year-old. In the past weeks, the focus of the anxiety might have been on you-know-what-19, but before then it was all about the future of the planet.\nIt is no massive surprise then that a survey for BBC Newsround has found that one in five kids have nightmares about the climate crisis. Or that two-fifths of the 2,000 children polled (aged eight to 16) don’t trust adults to sort it out.\nTears at bedtime: are children's books on environment causing climate anxiety?\nRead more\nDavid Spellman, a clinical psychologist who works with children, thinks there might be a bit more out there in the ether of digital media to trigger kids’ fear; that the coverage can be a bit hysterical (a common question put to experts is: how worried should we be?); and in Greta Thunberg there is someone kids can relate and listen to. Even so, children have always had catastrophic fears. “In my day – I’m 56 – it was about nuclear war,” Spellman says. “That was something that was bewildering, but felt real.”\nHe thinks adults can have the romantic notion that childhood is worry-free, but notes that we have become more aware of what children worry about, take it more seriously and are more open in understanding it. It need not be crippling.\nListening is key. “The danger is we dive in to lecture and advise rather than listen. It’s important to find ways to communicate, make sure they can talk about stuff,” says Spellman. And help them to become active consumers of information, to raise questions, ask what – and who – can be trusted. “I quite like the current trend for fact-checking people,” he adds.\n“When you’re talking about huge things, like the climate and disease, the overwhelming scale of these things is apparent to everyone,” says Spellman. “The small things they can do to make a difference is often helpful.” So, if the worry leads not to being unable to get out of bed, but to taking some kind of effective action, then that is maybe not so bad.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Even half a degree higher will significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.\nAdvertisement\nThe letter piles pressure on Timmermans, who is due to unveil the EU’s long-awaited climate law on Wednesday. A leaked draft of the law shows Timmermans’ plans to propose an EU-wide 2030 target by September. The target would probably be an emissions reduction of 50-55% compared with 1990 levels, which green activists say is not enough to guarantee meeting the EU’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\nEU officials think a couple of months’ difference in proposing the target makes little difference, but would allow them to bring onboard more reluctant countries, including Poland, which has not yet signed up to the EU-wide goal of net zero emissions by mid-century.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe climate and environment ministers argue timing is crucial, as they want the EU to have a 2030 target, before an EU-China summit in September and well ahead of Glasgow climate talks in November. “No other major economy is prepared to take the lead to ensure an ambitious implementation of the Paris agreement,” they write.\nWendel Trio, the director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: “By proposing a 2030 target increase only in September, the commission will give member states no time to reach an agreement by Cop26 in November, the international deadline by which all countries must commit to new, ambitious climate pledges for 2030. The EU needs to have its own house in order, and quickly to push other countries to make substantial contributions well before the deadline.”\nThe letter, organised by Denmark, was also signed by France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. Only two signatories – Slovenia and Latvia – are central and eastern countries that joined the EU after 2004. Germany is conspicuous by its absence.\nThe EU climate law is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, which aims to transform Europe’s economy to confront the climate emergency. The law could set Brussels on a collision course with populist governments in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which have been the slowest moving on the climate emergency. Putting the 2050 net zero target into law means Poland could be outvoted if it continued to refuse to sign up.\nQ&A\nWhat is the European Green Deal?\nShow\nThe European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy.\nAs well as the long-trailed goal of enshrining in law a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, the plan will propose cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). The current target is 40%\nMaking trade deals only with countries that stick to their climate targets under the Paris agreement\nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy laws will be tightened up to reflect the more demanding climate targets\nTo avoid penalising European steelmakers and other industry who are cleaning up their act, non-EU competitors importing energy-intensive goods could face a tax, known as “a carbon border adjustment mechanism”\nUsing EU funds to develop a zero carbon steel industry by 2030.\nCar and truck makers will have to do more to curb emissions, while the EU will seek to boost funding for electric vehicle charge points. Container and cruise ships, currently a gaping hole in efforts to tackle the climate emergency, will be brought into Europe’s emissions trading system, meaning maritime companies will probably have to buy pollution permits\nA new strategy to protect European nature, as well as plans to plant and restore forests. Also proposed are plans to improve air and water quality, as well as a review that could lead to tightening of industrial pollution laws\nTargets to cut pesticides, chemical fertilisers and increase the area of land devoted to organic farming will be part of an overhaul of the EU’s €59bn a year common agricultural policy\nA plan to raise a €100bn “just transition fund” from public and private sources to help EU member states move beyond fossil fuels\nThe European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs; money will have to be raised; plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out.\nWas this helpful?\nUnder the law, Brussels would also be able to take a government lagging behind on its climate target to the European court of justice, which can issue daily fines for failure to uphold EU law.\nPoland, which generates 80% of its electricity from coal, is seeking EU funds to help wean its economy from fossil fuels. The European commission has proposed a €100m (£87m) “just transition” fund to help countries with coal mining jobs adjust to a green economy, but Warsaw has yet to come onboard.\nClimate activists have accused the commission of lacking ambition, as the climate law gives scant detail on how the EU will meet the 2050 net zero target, either by phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, reforming the EU’s common agricultural policy or regulating industry.\n“With no 2030 climate target and no measures to end subsidies for fossil fuels, industrial farming and other destructive industries, the commission has left a big hole in what’s meant to be the flagship of the European Green Deal,” said Sebastian Mang, a climate and energy policy adviser at Greenpeace.\nThe Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is likely to give her verdict on the EU climate plans when she meets MEPs on Wednesday.

In addition, measures by governments to mitigate against the damage are predicted to become increasingly expensive and in some cases unsustainable.\nIn 30 years, erosion will have destroyed 36,097km (22,430 miles) or 13.6% of sandy coastlines identified from satellite images by scientists for the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European commission. They predict the situation will worsen in the second half of the century, washing away a further 95,061km or 25.7% of Earth’s beaches.\nThese estimates are far from the most catastrophic; they rely on an optimistic forecast of international action to fight climate breakdown, a scenario known as RCP4.5. In this scenario of reduced ice-cap melting and lower thermal expansion of water, oceans will only have risen by 50cm by 2100.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, if the world continues to emit carbon at its current rate, sea levels will rise by an estimated 80cm, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If this happens, a total of 131,745km of beaches, or 13% of the planet’s ice-free coastline, will go under water.\nAround the globe, the average shoreline retreat will be 86.4 metres in the RCP4.5 scenario or 128.1 metres in the high-carbon scenario, though amounts will vary significantly between locations. Flatter or wilder coastlines will be more affected than those where waterfronts are steeper, or those artificially maintained as part of coastal development.\nIn the best-case scenario, the UK will lose 1,531km or 27.7% of its sandy coast, and 2,415km (43.7%) in the worst case. Australia (14,849km lost) and Canada (14,425km) are predicted to be the worst-affected countries, followed by Chile (6,659km), Mexico (5,488km), China (5,440km) and the US (5,530km). The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau have short coastlines, but both are predicted to lose more than 60% of theirs.\nThe study predicts that the hardest-hit areas in the UK will be west Dorset, north Devon, Great Yarmouth, Barrow-in-Furness and north-east Lincolnshire. In these areas, beach retreat is predicted to be five times the national average.\nAdvertisement\n“The length of threatened seashores incorporates locations that will be submerged by more than 100 metres, assuming there are no physical limits to potential retreat,” said Michalis Vousdoukas, an oceanographer at the JRC and lead author of the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “Our 100-metre threshold is conservative since most beaches’ width is below 50 metres, especially near human settlements and in small islands, such as the Caribbean and the Mediterranean.”\nLarge beaches will narrow by 100-200 metres on Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Australian side of the Indian Ocean, wiping out more than 60% of sand deposits in a number of developing countries that are economically fragile and heavily dependent on coastal tourism.\nBut swift action to limit emissions and fight climate breakdown could help reduce the impact, experts say. “Moderate emissions mitigation could prevent 17% of the shoreline retreat in 2050 and 40% in 2100, thus preserving on average 42 metres of sand between land and sea,” Vousdoukas said.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe sea approaching coastal homes at Collaroy in Sydney, Australia.

Sediments may also be brought by rivers, either naturally as in the Amazon, or resulting from artificial activities as in the Chinese deltas that accumulate residues from industrial sites upstream.\nA third driver of erosion is the intensification of storms, which is associated with climate breakdown. These look on course to further erode the most vulnerable beaches; the study predicts that the British seashores facing most erosion are the east and west coasts, which are more exposed to tidal surges than the south.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBy the end of the century up to 63% of low-lying coastal regions worldwide will be threatened. In these areas, both population density and development tend to be higher than inland.\n“Seaward human expansion will continue, mostly in unspoiled coastlines that are particularly extensive in Asia and Africa,” Vousdoukas said. “Adaptive measures are urgently needed.”\nIn many places, the cost of protecting the shoreline often outweighs the benefits. For example, in 2017 a £62m sea wall was built to protect the tourist resort of Blackpool. Besides requiring indefinite spending on maintenance, such concrete defences are seen as more of a problem than a solution as they can disrupt the process by which sand is deposited by ocean currents, exacerbating erosion.\nIn some places the Environmental Agency has chosen to replenish beaches with sand dredged offshore. Not only is this harmful to marine habitats, mining sand from the seabed is expensive. Since 1994 millions of pounds have been spent yearly to replenish the 20km seafront between Skegness and Mablethorpe in Lincolnshire, also helping to preserve 35,000 hectares of farmland.\nDr Sally Brown, deputy head of life and environmental sciences at Bournemouth University, said: “Building defences helps maintain coastline position, but defences are known to reduce beach width or depth over multiple decades. Responding to sea-level rise means looking strategically at how and where we defend coasts today, which may mean protecting only limited parts of the coast.\n“Beach nourishment schemes can help the problem, such as in Bournemouth, but these beaches need a regular top-up. Ultimately, we cannot nourish everywhere for ever, meaning that hard decisions need to be made about how much to spend and how to manage the coast in decades to come. This could affect those living on the coast, and tourists who enjoy the sandy beaches too. Sea-level rise will only make this situation worse.”\n• An interactive map showing beaches that will lose or gain ground can be found here.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Temperatures this summer were above average across almost the entire country.\nDr Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist with the bureau, said the hot summer, which was marked by the unprecedented bushfire crisis that devastated communities and wildlife in much of the country, was part of a long-term warming trend that had seen the country warm by 1.4C since 1910. Most of that warming has come since 1950.\nTrewin said: “That tells us the baseline is higher, and with that you have a higher risk of high extremes like we have seen in the past two summers. Our baseline expectation now is for warmer than average summers, and other seasons more generally.”\nAdvertisement\nThe heat records are relative to the long-term average for the years between 1961 and 1990.\nThe bureau’s summer report came as its officials told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra that Australia is heating more rapidly than the global average.\nKarl Braganza, the head of climate monitoring, was asked how much Australia was projected to warm, given a scientific analysis involving the World Meteorological Organisation last year found average global temperatures were expected to rise between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100 under commitments put forward by national governments as part of the Paris agreement.\nBraganza said the increase in Australia would be expected to be “closer to 4C” heating than the global average under that scenario, assuming countries did not do more than promised in Paris.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAdam Bandt, the Greens leader, said the government was undertaking no planning for the possibility of 4C warming in Australia. “Australia saw this horrific bushfire season with just over one degree of warming. We’re hurtling towards 4C and it’s only going to get worse from here,” he said.\nThis summer saw many more heat records broken than cool records. The bureau data shows 43 sites in NSW broke high temperature records but only five sites saw record lows. In Queensland, there were 10 heat records broken across different monitoring stations, but only one record for cool weather.\nThe 2018-19 summer also saw below average rainfall across the country, with western NSW, south-western Queensland and the Top End particularly dry. Some areas, including Western Australia’s west coast, and parts of the east coast, saw above average rainfall.\nThe second hottest summer comes after the bureau declared 2019 the hottest and driest year on record.\nData from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows 2019 was the hottest year on record.\nAdvertisement\nTrewin said the summer could be characterised as a season “of two halves”.\n“We had December and the first few days of January, which was extremely hot almost nationwide, and extremely dry. Those heat extremes in December and early January were quite exceptional,” he said.\nThat exceptional heat included 17 and 18 December, when on two consecutive days Australia recorded its hottest day on record. The national average temperature on 18 December was 41.9C – one whole degree hotter than the previous day.\nDecember 2019 also delivered the worst conditions for bushfires on a record going back to 1950.\nSeveral records were broken for warmest summer nights in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. On 1 February, nighttime temperatures in the rural area of Condobolin, west of Dubbo, NSW, did not drop below 34.7C.\nAustralia records worst December fire conditions after its hottest, driest year\nRead more\nAside from climate change, there were natural drivers of the heat in the early part of the summer. Trewin said in December and early January, the weather patterns were influenced by a strong Indian Ocean Dipole that had dragged moisture away from the continent and a “strongly negative Southern Annular Mode”.\nBut as both these systems moved into a neutral phase, the rest of January and February was less extreme.\nRainfall for January and February was slightly above average, Trewin said, but the extreme dry of December meant that across the three months rainfall was below average.\nBut 10 February still delivered record rainfall for some parts of NSW. At Taralga, 100km west of Wollongong, the town had its wettest summer day on record with 197mm beating the previous record of 130mm, set in 1885.\nWhile the bureau’s report does not cover ocean temperatures, the hot summer has also seen the build-up of heat stress on the Great Barrier Reef, with scientists fearing a third mass coral bleaching event in the past five years if temperatures don’t fall in the next few days.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Some say it's just greenwashing","paragraph":"R\nepublican lawmakers under pressure to address the climate crisis are trying to move beyond denying the problem and start proposing solutions. But they still refuse to commit to what scientists say is necessary if the US is to rapidly cut back on burning fossil fuels.\nWhere do the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on the climate crisis?\nRead more\nA recent package of legislation proposed by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy would encourage capturing climate pollutants from power plants but use them to drill for oil.\nIt would also lead to the planting of a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions but also ramp up logging, an idea Donald Trump has endorsed.\n“It’s greenwashing,” said Randi Spivak, public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity, which organized a letter of opposition on the tree bill from dozens of environment groups to the House natural resources committee.\n“The science is very clear,” Spivak said. “We need to slash our carbon pollution by 50% over the next 10 years if we want to avert the worst impacts of global warming and keep global warming to a 1.5C increase.”\nThe Republican party has seen a pendulum swing. In 2008, its election platform emphasized the importance of cutting emissions. By 2016, Donald Trump ran on a campaign of climate denial.\nNow at least some prominent Republicans are breaking from the president and veering away from questioning the science and toward efforts that do not directly attack the coal, oil and gas industries. Facing pushback from the far right, on the other side of the aisle they are criticized by some Democrats who believe they are not proposing legislation in good faith.\nEven someone who’s not a forester should be able to recognize an olive branch when they see one\nCongressman Bruce Westerman\nAlex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions – a right-of-center organization that advocates reducing carbon pollution while growing the US economy – said the House bills were “directionally correct” but “need to grow to address the scale of our climate problem”.\nFlint’s group backs revenue-neutral carbon tax and deregulation.\n“I give [House Republicans] a great deal of credit for acknowledging the problem and stepping forward with proposals and recognizing that the politics of this has changed,” he said. “But also acknowledging that they are in the early stages of really substantive climate proposals.”\nBruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican who introduced the trees bill, insisted his proposal would curb emissions even as it promotes logging.\nWhen trees are cut down, they stop absorbing carbon. Westerman, a forester who worked for an engineering consulting firm in the timber, pulp and paper business, said forest managers would just plant them again.\nProducts made from the trees would pay for continual planting, he said, and the wood would be used for sustainable buildings with lower emissions footprints.\nA scientist called to testify by Democrats, Yale ecology professor Carla Staver, strongly disagreed with Westerman’s proposals.\nForest management is an important way to fight climate change but it is not enough and it must be done properly, experts agree. A bill from Democrats would aim to conserve forests without increasing logging and by banning oil and gas drilling on public lands if climate emissions exceed targets.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBruce Westerman. Photograph: Katheleen Williams\nWesterman told the Guardian Democrats should be working with Republicans who want to address climate change.\n“Even someone who’s not a forester should be able to recognize an olive branch when they see one,” he said.\nEven as Westerman defended his bill, the top Republican on his committee seemed to dismiss the overall effort.\nAt the beginning of the meeting, to which he was late, Rob Bishop of Utah suggested the elevators in House office buildings would be more timely under the rule of Benito Mussolini than they are with Democrats in charge. Democratic climate proposals, he said, offered not a “silver bullet” to fix the problem but “another bullet that is going to be used to shoot ourselves in the foot”.\nHe then showed a graph demonstrating how US heat-trapping emissions have declined over time.\nWhile the Republican bills are far from aggressive, the right of the party is pushing back. The conservative Club for Growth Pac painted the package as “stifling liberal environmental taxes, regulations, and subsidies” and vowed to withhold support from any backers.\nFrom grape to grain: how a warming climate is changing what we eat and drink\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nAt the annual CPAC gathering near Washington, the climate change denial group the Heartland Institute presented a German teen activist who calls herself a “climate sceptic” as a foil to Greta Thunberg.\nIn Oregon, Republican state senators fled the state capitol in order to derail a climate change bill.\nDespite that backdrop, the top Democrat on the House natural resources committee welcomed Westerman’s proposal. Raúl Grijalva said he hoped for a “new chapter”, focusing on solutions not denial.\nHe said: “For too long my friends on the other side of aisle denied that this was even a real issue.

Here are some of the key subjects the committee is likely to quiz him on.\nHis record\nWhen Bailey was appointed he was widely hailed as a “safe pair of hands”. However, critics of his time at the Financial Conduct Authority beg to differ. Gina Miller, the businesswoman best known for her legal challenge to the government’s attempt to push through Brexit without parliamentary approval, is leading a group calling for a review of Bailey’s appointment and has welcomed the Treasury committee’s opportunity to examine his record.\nCoronavirus: the week explained - sign up for our email newsletter\nRead more\nMiller has highlighted his reaction to the collapse of investments run by London Capital & Finance, and the liquidation of Neil Woodford’s once-popular flagship investment fund, among other things.\n“The hundreds of thousands of Britain’s depositors, savers, investors and pensioners whose lives have been ruined and savings squandered, on Mr Bailey’s watch as CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, deserve no less,” Miller said.\nBailey has argued on many of the issues that the FCA’s statutory powers were limited. However, the scandals have overshadowed his time at the regulator.\nCoronavirus\nThere are questions about how much the Bank can do to support the economy given the global nature of the coronavirus outbreak and the limited firepower central banks have at their disposal to combat an economic downturn.\nBailey arrives with interest rates still close to the lowest levels in the Bank’s 325-year history, at 0.75%, only 0.25 percentage points higher than when Carney started at the Bank almost seven years ago and limiting the scope for further cuts if deemed necessary. Whether Bailey will be able to make much of an inroad into returning rates to more normal levels will be closely watched.\nBrexit\nThe British economy could be put under renewed strain later this year as the Brexit negotiations gather pace ahead of the deadline for the UK’s exit from the transition period at the end of December, which Boris Johnson has warned he will not extend.\nOnce the dust from the coronavirus outbreak has settled, the path for interest rates and the continued stability of the financial system will partly depend on the nation’s new trading relationship with the EU, and the extent to which there are tougher barriers, friction at Britain’s borders and whether there is a smooth or abrupt transition.\nCarney had been accused of bringing the central bank’s independence into question, given his repeated warnings about the threat posed by Brexit to the UK economy and banking system.\nServing under the government of Boris Johnson, the new governor could face more questions about Britain’s future relationship with the EU.\nClimate\nAs governor, Mark Carney brought to the top of the agenda the importance of global heating as a problem for central bankers to address, warning about the existential crisis facing the world financial system.\nThreadneedle Street is preparing to run a “catastrophic” climate-related stress test next year, a landmark moment. Bailey will need to show early on that he will take the issue as seriously as his predecessor.\nHedge fund scandal\nBailey is likely to face questions about the embarrassing revelation about a backup audio feed that without the Bank’s knowledge potentially allowed traders early access to an audio feed of market-moving Bank press conferences.\nThe answers to those questions could have broader implications for how the Bank protects key national infrastructure, amid criticisms of where accountability lies for failures at the institution.\nDiversity\nBailey is set to become the 121st governor – and the 121st man to take the role. That imbalance is mirrored throughout the top levels of the Bank, with a lack of gender or ethnic diversity in top jobs.\nThere is only one woman, Silvana Tenreyro, on the Bank’s nine-member rate-setting monetary policy committee. Across the Bank Bailey will be pressured to close ethnicity and gender pay gaps, as well as increase representation, which sometimes went backwards during Carney’s tenure.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nIndependence\nThe Bank of England is run at arm’s length from the government to preserve its independence at setting interest rates and producing economic forecasts. As the government expands its spending – boosting the economy – the Bank of England may feel the need to raise interest rates to stop inflationary pressures building. That could bring the Bank into conflict with the government and Johnson’s choice as chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\nHow Threadneedle Street and Downing Street work together will be a key question of Bailey’s regime – and potentially his legacy as governor.\nWhile we have you ...\n... we’re asking readers like you to make a contribution in support of our independent journalism.

Conversations on the bus, at work and in the pub arefocused on the prospect of a deadly disease spreading uncontrollably. Stock markets are falling as fear about the coronavirus heightens and the potential cost for the world economy becomes increasingly apparent.\nWall Street has suffered the fastest reversal since 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression. The Dow lost more than 10% of its value in a week from record-breaking highs to the lowest point since 2016. More than $5tn (£3.9tn) has been wiped off the value of global markets. The FTSE 100 is not immune, plunging the most in a week since the 2008 crash. Markets are expected to fall further this week.\nIn the battle to contain the coronavirus through travel bans, school closures and the cancellation of business conferences, the damage to companies, economic growth and living standards could be unprecedented. According to Capital Economics, world growth could collapse into recession for the first time since 2009. The safeguarding of life takes primary importance as the death toll around the world climbs, but the knock-on economic impacts will also have lasting repercussions.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nGiven the growing impacton lives and livelihoods, it is clear that another parallel with the 2008 chaos is needed: a coordinated international response to ease fears around the globe. Against a backdrop of nationalism and protectionism in Britain, the US and several other countries, however, such thinking may be wishful.\nGordon Brown led the global response to the 2008 crisis by bringing together the world’s richest nations to tackle it together. Labour’s last prime minister played an instrumental role in convening the G20 to organise the fightback by expanding government spending.\nUntil Brown stepped in, handling the fallout had been uncoordinated and shambolic. Even though his task was complicated by a relatively protectionist US president in George W Bush, a quick glance across the Atlantic now seems to render his difficulties benign compared with the current tensions in global relations.\nAfter the London meetings of the G20 in early 2009 with the banking system on its knees and riots on the streets, the world’s wealthiest nations agreed an unprecedented and concerted fiscal expansion, promising to create or save millions of jobs which would otherwise have been destroyed. The price tag amounted to $5tn. It is hard to imagine such an approach today.\nThe collaboration to prevent the Great Recession from becoming a rerun of the Great Depression did not, however, last long. SA slide into austerity, populism and protectionism began soon after in many nations, leaving the door open to Brexit, Donald Trump, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.\nThe world today seems to lack figures who might orchestrate a fightback against the coronavirus. Boris Johnson is missing in action, apparently unable to travel as far as northern England, the West Country or Wales to show leadership following widespread floods. Donald Trump believes that all is fine in his election year, dismissing the biggest single-day crash in US stock market in history and labelling coronavirus as the Democrats’ latest hoax.\nThe story of the outbreak speaks volumes about the constitution of the world economy and political landscape after decades of ever-closer integration. At this time of questioning and challenging the international order, it is the tale of late capitalism writ large.\nDespite only joining the world trade system two decades ago as a bit-part player, China, which is at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, accounts for around a fifth of the world economy and is key to global supply chains, a factor that great amplifies the economic fallout. Rising numbers of middle-class citizens, cheap flights and better transport have boosted tourism numbers worldwide from about 500 million in 1995 to more than 1.3 billion in 2017. People are increasingly on the move, and with them, infectious diseases.\nHealth scares are becoming more frequent, with increasingly evident links to global heating and extreme weather events. Rising flood waters, bush fires and hurricanes restrict access to safe water, and food and sanitary living conditions, and put pressure on healthcare systems.\nAfter a decade of austerity the fear is that the NHS might not have the capacity to respond, and the eminent academic Sir Michael Marmot confirmed last week that austerity has had a disproportional impact on the life expectancy of the poorest in Britain.\nAdvertisement\nPandemics are more easily spread and have a greater impact as a result of globalisation, complex supply chains, travel and tourism. A world of 24-hour news and social media fuelled by rapid advances in technology – including the spread of fake news – fans the flames of panic.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nIt is a situation where fear can spread faster than the pathogen, according to David Owen, chief European economist at the US Bank Jefferies, who said most economic losses from infectious disease outbreaks result from the actions of unaffected individuals.\nThere are many lessons. Globalisation, technology and climate change make the spread of viral disease easier and incubate many other social and economic ills. Lurching headlong into a protectionist and luddite world will not provide adequate and lasting solutions.\nThe scale of our collective problems demand international coordination.\nWhile we have you ...\n... we’re asking readers like you to make a contribution in support of our independent journalism.

However, environmental campaigners have long harboured concerns that plug-in hybrids do not offer the environmental benefits suggested by carmakers’ advertising or regulators’ laboratory tests.\nAll of the UK’s top 11 bestselling plug-in hybrids have limitations on pure electric driving ability. Cold temperatures can trigger the internal combustion engine in Volvo’s XC90 SUV, the Mercedes-Benz E Class executive car, and Kia’s Niro crossover.\nAdvertisement\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander SUV, the UK’s bestselling plug-in last year, has an “EV” button that switches on “EV priority” mode. However, the internal combustion engine will kick in if the driver switches on the adaptive cruise control, to automatically maintain a safe distance from the car in front, or if the battery gets too hot or too cold in more extreme conditions.\nJaguar Land Rover’s Range Rover and Range Rover Sport plug-ins will start their internal combustion engines if more power is required than the electric engine can provide alone, as will Porsche’s Cayenne. There are also speed limits on all-electric driving for BMW’s 2, 3 and 5 Series cars as well its Mini Countryman plug-in.\nThe carmakers all carefully avoid making any incorrect claims on their products’ green credentials in their marketing materials. However, campaigners have criticised the emphasis in many brochures and advertisements on zero-emissions driving capabilities, when these may be difficult to achieve in normal use.\nHow green are electric cars?\nRead more\nGreg Archer, UK director at campaign group Transport & Environment, said one leading carmaker “is conning its customers”, after it was approached by an unhappy owner of a plug-in hybrid. The group, which passed the correspondence to the Guardian, has been highly critical of plug-in hybrids, some of which it labels “fake EVs” because of their continued use of internal combustion engines.\n“A [plug-in hybrid] is not driving with zero emissions if it switches on its engine when the driver de-mists the windscreen,” Archer said. “This is another example of carmakers attempting to mislead their customers about the real emissions from their car.”\nSeparate data from the Miles Consultancy, which tracks fuel use by companies, found that in real life almost all plug-in hybrid cars failed to achieve the mileage found in lab tests, suggesting that many users do not charge them sufficiently. Updated analysis for the Guardian of 1,388 plug-ins used over eight months found they achieved an average of more than 40 miles per gallon when using a mixture of petrol and electric power, only a third of the 127 miles per gallon advertised by their manufacturers.\nLast month the government said it plans to ban all hybrids from sale in the UK from 2035 or earlier, signalling that promoting battery electric cars with zero exhaust emissions was its priority. Buyers of plug-in hybrids could also risk being caught by tightening emissions limits in British cities.\nAdvertisement\nThe prospect of a hybrid ban infuriated carmakers, who say the technology is the only way to cut emissions quickly. The carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the UK rose for the third consecutive year in 2019.\nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Plug-in hybrids are an important and attractive stepping stone for people not yet suited or able to invest in a fully electric vehicle, giving the flexibility of zero-emission miles on urban commutes and extended range for longer, out-of-town journeys.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n“Drivers also have the peace of mind that the engine will kick in to provide the necessary boost if the battery level falls too low to deliver sufficient power for energy-intensive operations such as high-speed overtaking or windscreen de-icing, thus guaranteeing safety and the most efficient use of energy at all times.”\nSelling thousands of plug-in hybrids is also a key part of carmakers’ plans to meet tightening emissions limits and avoid heavy fines, and industry analysts expect a hybrid “price war” over the coming year as companies try to shift the cars in large volumes. Companies including Toyota, BMW and Daimler have bet heavily on hybrid technologies.\n“The vast majority of owners we surveyed use their Outlander [plug-in hybrid] as it was engineered and are enjoying a lower carbon footprint and lower running costs as a result,” a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

He says he cannot bear the thought of leaving his ancestors behind.\n“It’s our right to be here, to have a voice, to be recognised, and to make others realise this is our home … We have the right to live a healthy life, here, on our island.”\nThe Billy family also live on nearby Poruma island, where Danny spent part of his childhood. Just a 15-minute flight away, Poruma is smaller and thinner. On the western shore, a road and buildings are threatened, and 250 coconut trees – a source of food, shelter and leaves used in traditional ceremonies – have already been washed away.\nLocal man Phillemon Mosby feels that loss keenly. The picturesque plantation should be a place to share with children and grandchildren, who would ordinarily take over the nurturing of the site.\n“That experience was taken away because of climate change, because of the rising sea levels.

But there is widespread scepticism among Islanders about when the new walls will be constructed.\nIn early 2018, emergency funding of $650,000 was granted to Poruma to protect its western shore, but the wall was built using geotextile sandbags with a 50-year life expectancy, rather than the rock or brick asked for by the community. More work is required to protect the shoreline. Where the coast remains exposed, coconut trees lie on the beach, their roots slowly ripping away from the island.\nAdvertisement\nOther islands including Boigu, Masig and Iama need new seawalls.

They said it was ‘an infrastructure development in the community’. They’re still trying to cover up climate change and the rising sea levels here.”\nTamu gained international headlines when he asked prime minister Scott Morrison during the UN climate summit in New York last September to visit Warraber. He maintains that the damage visible on Warraber and other islands would shock them into action on climate and coal.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWarraber’s south-western shoreline at low tide.

What happens if they vanish?","paragraph":"U\nnfurling across paintings, poems and carvings, Cymbidium orchids are more than just wild plants in China. They are inextricably linked with the country’s culture. But this rich blooming of human response to orchids that has endured for millennia is fragile, and as Cymbidium orchids increasingly vanish from the wild so too do the words and knowledge that humans have about them.\nEvery year the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the New York Botanical Garden open their doors to thousands of visitors who flock to their orchid shows. Easily grown and long-lasting orchids such as generic Phalaenopsis form the bulk of these temporary displays. But behind the scenes these institutions engage in longer-term work to conserve not just living plants but also records of the culture attached to them.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nKanran orchid, Cymbidium kanran Makino. A hand coloured woodblock print by Kōno Bairei from Kusa Bana Hyakushu (One Hundred Varieties of Flowers), Tokyo, Yamada, 1901. Photograph: Florilegius/Alamy Stock Photo\nKew’s Spirit Collection contains ghostly flowers of Cymbidium kanran; their colour washed out but their three-dimensional shape preserved by immersion in a mixture of alcohol, glycerol, and water. In collaboration with the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Beijing, Kew has also developed a collection of plants – including orchids – in the forms they are used in traditional Chinese medicine – chopped, dried, fried and so on. Indexed with scientific botanical names, this collection is a repository of knowledge and a reference tool for authenticating botanical ingredients.\nDr Barnabas Seyler, assistant researcher in the department of environment at Sichuan University, looked at the relationship between biodiversity and cultural diversity by examining changes in knowledge of Cymbidium orchids in Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture, Sichuan.\n“As an ethnobotanist, I find all facets of biocultural diversity to be fascinating,” says Seyler.\n“Many people, particularly in the west, but also in rapidly changing, urbanising, and modernising China do not fully appreciate the magnitude of symbolism and pride that Cymbidium have held throughout history in traditional Han Chinese culture,” he says.\n“Symbolism, metaphors, and poetry associated with Cymbidium are credited to have begun with Confucius’s own sayings and infuse traditional Confucian thought today. If you walk into any Chinese restaurant around the world, or into any tea parlour or salon in China, you will likely find paintings, furniture, place settings, or other material culture items depicting Cymbidium orchids.”\nAdvertisement\nOrchids, like other wild species, are vulnerable to the impact of climate change and habitat loss. But Cymbidium species native to Sichuan studied by Seyler have an additional vulnerability – their beauty. Between 2005–2008, when Cymbidium prices were at their peak, wild-collected rare forms could be sold for six-figure sums. In 2006 one was bought for 4.6m Chinese yuan (£511,000).\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nOrchid specimens from the Spirit Collection at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\nInterviewing individuals in predominantly Yi and Han communities, Seyler and his colleagues assessed whether people could identify different Cymbidium species. Additionally, they asked about local ecological knowledge: how to find, harvest and grow orchids, as well as orchid business knowledge, and awareness of orchids in arts, academia and idiomatic expressions.\nIn all categories of knowledge, they found that when species were locally extinct, knowledge about them had declined, except among individuals involved in their trade.\nHelp bees by not mowing dandelions, gardeners told\nRead more\nSeyler believes that botanical gardens contribute much towards conserving biocultural diversity, “through ex-situ collections, for example collecting and showcasing plants like Cymbidium, advocating for their conservation, and educating the general public, and documenting traditional knowledge, stories, and cultural traditions associated with these plants”.\nIn the US, New York Botanical Garden is a designated plant rescue centre. When the US Fish and Wildlife Service finds shipments of orchids that lack the paperwork to prove they were either cultivated or sustainably collected from the wild, they are sent to a plant rescue centre. If the country of export does not request their return within 30 days, they are incorporated into the institution’s collection, but remain US government property.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nOrchid Festival 2020 in the Princess of Wales Conservatory at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

Culture doesn’t entirely disappear because of the loss of one plant or group of plants. But what happens if species loss continues?\nSeyler believes botanical gardens are playing a vital role in keeping the culture alive. “They can help to address some of the educational, social, and economic challenges that contribute to the unsustainable overharvest of biodiversity,” he says.\n• The orchid festival at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, runs until 15 March.

This untouched region is waterlogged for most of the year and is an important habitat for endangered forest elephants and lowland gorillas.\nIn 2017 it made headlines after scientists announced the discovery of 145,500 sq km (56,200 sq miles) of peatlands. They estimated it stored the equivalent of three years of global fossil fuel emissions, making it one of the greatest carbon sinks on the planet, according to a paper published in the journal Nature.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Congo basin, which is the world’s second largest tropical forest, spans six countries, including Congo-Brazzaville. Photograph: Kevin McElvaney/Greenpeace\nAdvertisement\nBut in August 2019, a Congolese company called Petroleum Exploration and Production Africa (Pepa) announced there were hundreds of millions of barrels of oil under the Cuvette Centrale. Exploiting this resource would quadruple the country’s oil production and sort out its debt-ridden finances, the company claimed.\nIn a televised speech a few days later, Congo-Brazzaville’s president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, said the oil fields would not destroy the peatlands because they were on the periphery of drilling sites and added that he had “no intention” of ducking the obligation to protect the habitat. Environment minister Arlette Soudan-Nonault reinforced the message, telling Le Monde that drilling was “not in the peat bogs”.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA scientist at work in a remote part of Congo-Brazzaville that is thought to contain billions of tonnes of peat. Photograph: Simon Lewis/University of Leeds\nHowever, according to the investigation, the environmental assessment that looked at the impact of the drilling in 2013 was written a year before the discovery of the peatlands in 2014. The head of Pepa told the Guardian an environmental impact study that was validated by the ministry of the environment was carried out before recent exploration work.\nTwo of the four potential underground reservoirs are directly under carbon-rich peatlands, according to analysis of publicly available data from researchers at the University of Leeds.\nGlobal Witness says it believes the proposed Ngoki oil block contains 6,000 sq km of peatland. Using data from the University of Leeds’ online resource CongoPeat, the organisation estimates that draining this section of peatland alone could release 1.34 gigatonnes of carbon – the same as the total annual emissions of Japan.\nProf Simon Lewis, who led the UK-Congolese research team that found the peatlands, says preserving them is “absolutely essential in terms of meeting Paris agreement commitments”. An influx of people to the region would also increase hunting, road building and further exploitation, he said. “There are huge amounts of carbon and biodiversity, and this should be one of the regions where we have different development pathways that don’t lead to the destruction of the natural world. If it’s not here in Congo, where is it possible? There’s a real opportunity here to do something different and much better.”\nWorld leaders urged to 'step back from precipice' of ecological ruin\nRead more\nThe Ngoki oil project is being spearheaded by Congolese oil baron Claude Wilfrid “Willy” Etoka, who is the 10th richest man in francophone Africa, believed to be worth more than $500m (£388m). He is chairman of Pepa as well as the company’s major shareholder. Etoka claims the scheme will not damage the environment and told the Guardian the Ngoki project is “far from the peatlands”.\nAdvertisement\n“Compared to coastal oil operations, which can produce traces of marine pollution, oil exploration in the Cuvette presents no risk of environmental disturbance … The president of the Republic of the Congo, who is in charge of protecting the Congo basin, would not have authorised us to explore for oil there if there was any evidence of such risks,” he said.\nSoudan-Nonault also told the Guardian the Ngoki permit was located “on the edge and outside” of the peatland area.\nOil industry experts say proclamations of vast oil reserves have been exaggerated and, after looking at seismic surveys, Total and Shell rejected offers to invest in Ngoki in 2015. A senior source at Shell said seismic surveys showed the oil deposits were probably “modest” and “given the surface risk and operational challenges in this area, the ‘size of the prize’ would have to be very substantial”.\nCritics say the exploration done so far – a 2D seismic survey and one exploratory well in 2019 – are not sufficient to work out the size of the oil reservoir. A geologist chartered with the Geological Society of London who looked at the seismic survey described it as “very basic” and said “there could be nothing of significance”. Pepa claims that a large well was discovered during drilling.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nScientists are working to identify tropical peatlands in the Congo basin, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Photograph: Kevin McElvaney/Greenpeace\nAdvertisement\nFrancis Perrin, a senior research fellow with an expertise in oil and gas at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Stratégiques says Pepa’s claims that the Ngoki oil project could produce 900,000 barrels a day are “ridiculous”.\n“Serious international companies will not invest in this project until Pepa can put their findings on the table,” he said. “It’s not enough to have one survey – you have to do multiple surveys and that can take months or years, depending on the size of the discovery.”\nEtoka told the Guardian the size of the oil discovery was based on “objectively verifiable data”. He added: “Production tests will tell us a little more in days to come. We are continuing to keep a low profile while awaiting confirmation.” President Sassou-Nguesso declined to comment.\nColin Robertson, a campaigner from Global Witness who worked on the investigation, said: “The vast amounts of carbon stored in Congo basin’s peatland forests means they are of global importance in the fight against climate change. These are the one of the last places on Earth that extracting more fossil fuels should be considered.

Cars account for just over 18% of UK emissions, according to government figures, and reining back pollution from the sector is seen as crucial to efforts to cut the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.\nLisa Barber, editor of Which? magazine, said: “It is shocking to see our tests uncover increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions for the latest cars that are being built and sold to UK consumers.\n“Manufacturers must ensure that they are doing everything in their power to create cleaner vehicles that are fitter for our planet and its future.”\nOverall, cars that met the latest emissions regulations (standards known as Euro 6d and Euro 6d-temp) produced 162.1g of CO2 per kilometre, 10.5g more than those in the previous generation (Euro 6b and Euro 6c).\nAdvertisement\nThat was far above the 95g target carmakers must meet across all EU sales in order to avoid steep fines. Manufacturers across Europe are racing to make and sell new electric models in order to meet the rules, although many are relying on hybrid models that combine internal combustion with battery power.\nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry lobby group, said: “We can’t comment on the results of non-official tests by commercial organisations where the methodology is unclear.\n“Only the official, Europe-wide WLTP [Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure] test – the toughest and most comprehensive in the world – can be relied upon by consumers to accurately compare vehicles on a like-for-like and repeatable basis.

Cars sold in the UK in 2019 produced average emissions of 127.9g of CO2 per kilometre.\nThe Which? analysis found that carbon emissions were rising across every segment of the car market, from smaller city cars through to SUVs, as manufacturers packed more technology into their cars. Emissions rose fastest in the hybrid segment, up by 31% between generations, in part because of the weight of two different power sources.\nNewer cars performed significantly better on air quality issues, with the latest models slashing emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, both of which directly harm human health.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nThe tests also found that carbon emissions were higher than official readings carried out by EU regulators, which do not measure extended use at motorway speeds or take into account a car full of people using the air conditioning and the radio.\nDoug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said the figures showed that the government should ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, earlier than current plans to ban internal combustion engines from 2035.\n“It’s clear that we can’t simply rely on the car industry’s good will to make progress,” he said. “We need decisive intervention from government, starting with enforcing existing rules on car emissions and bringing in a firm ban on sales of new diesel and petrol vehicles by 2030.”\nAdvertisement\n• This article was amended on 28 February 2020 because an earlier version misnamed the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, as the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

News about the environment is alarming far more frequently than it is cheering. So campaigners were understandably jubilant on Thursday when the court of appeal issued its surprise ruling that the government’s plans to build a third runway at Heathrow are illegal.\nNot only does the ruling make it increasingly unlikely that the controversial project, approved by the House of Commons in June 2018, will go ahead (Heathrow has said it will appeal, while the government has said it will not). The judges set an extraordinary precedent. This is because they made their ruling on grounds that the policy of expanding the airport is incompatible with commitments made by the government in the Paris climate agreement. While the law says that national policy must take account of the UK’s climate commitments, the 2018 airport statement didn’t.\nAdvertisement\nThe ramifications reach beyond these shores. The case brought by the legal charity Plan B, and others including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the mayor of London, has shown that with the right legislation in place, international climate agreements can have a direct bearing on domestic decision-making. But the biggest impact will be in the UK, where it has already given a boost to activists despondent at the government’s lack of preparedness for Cop26, the hugely important round of UN climate negotiations it will host in November. Given Boris Johnson’s earlier opposition to Heathrow expansion, it is possible, if not yet certain, that he will take the opportunity offered by this week’s court ruling to abandon the third runway once and for all.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBeyond the immediate significance of Heathrow, particularly to the west London residents who have consistently opposed it, the judgment highlights a deeper tension between economic development and climate policymaking. We are in a climate emergency. This legal ruling shows that under the law, ministers cannot default – when it suits them – to business as usual. As Lord Deben, the chair of the advisory Committee on Climate Change, put it: “The fact is, it is the law that we have to keep our emissions down.”\nThere is probably no area in which economic and environmental imperatives are harder to reconcile than aviation. Currently responsible for around 2% of global emissions, its share is predicted to grow fast. Aviation emissions rose by 32% between 2013 and 2018, and in the UK are expected to overtake all other sources by 2050. While new batteries, sustainable fuels and new engine technology are all anticipated, the prospect of anything approaching “green” flying remains remote.\nThat’s why the government’s official advice is that aviation should be allowed to buck the trend of decarbonisation, and to grow by up to 25% between now and 2050. But even if this is accepted – despite the risks – ministers must address the question of where this growth will take place, while working to reduce demand via new charges such as a frequent-flyer levy. While there is spare capacity in some places, airports from Aberdeen to Southampton have plans to expand passenger numbers by 59%, far beyond the official guidance. Such plans are not compatible with the UK’s climate goals.\nBritain needs a national aviation plan to weigh the demands of different regions against each other. But nowhere must boosting air traffic be viewed as a shortcut to prosperity. In an era of climate breakdown, there is really no option other than to seek alternative routes to success.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But developing countries have been left wondering whether they will receive the funds they need to avoid disaster.\nThe business secretary, Alok Sharma, who will lead this year’s UN climate talks, Cop26, in Glasgow, set out plans to generate the finance needed for a low-carbon global economy. The UK will provide £11.6bn over the period from 2021 to 2025 to help poor countries cut carbon and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown and will invite other developed nations to pledge similar amounts.\nThe principle that rich countries must provide sufficient funding to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the ravages of climate breakdown has underpinned the UN climate talks for more than a decade. At the Copenhagen talks in 2009, rich countries agreed that the flows of money to the poor world must reach at least $100bn by 2020. That pledge was reiterated in the Paris agreement of 2015.\nAdvertisement\nBut poor countries are concerned that the funding is not being provided and that the sums agreed more than 10 years ago are insufficient. Sharma quoted estimates from the OECD that $7tn a year would be needed up to 2030 to meet the emissions-cutting goals of the Paris agreement and UN development goals to alleviate poverty.\nSo far there is little in the way of a roadmap to show how funding can be expanded to reach those levels. Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a thinktank, said: “These warm words are said by every incoming Cop president and yet the promised finance to poorer countries has not materialised. Richer countries combined are shirking their responsibility to deliver the paltry $100bn of climate funding they promised the poor countries 11 years ago and yet the UK alone has just given the go-ahead to the HS2 train line, which could cost £106bn.\n“This climate finance is vital not only to build adaptation and help poor countries decarbonise their economies, it’s also essential for building trust in the negotiations, which will be vital if the UK are going to oversee a successful summit.”\nQ&A\nWhat is Cop – and how will it help?\nShow\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent\nWas this helpful?\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMark Carney, the outgoing Bank governor, who will soon take on a new post as climate envoy for the UK, stressed the role of the private sector in generating funding for a low-carbon transition. Poor countries are concerned that the most vulnerable will miss out. Adow said: “For the very poorest people, much of this private-sector investment won’t reach them. It’s well known that there is more money to be made for the private sector in middle-income countries rather than those truly on the frontlines of the climate crisis.”\nIf the UK is to reach a successful outcome at Cop26 – Sharma said “all countries must commit to significant further cuts to carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero as soon as possible” – then the support of all developing countries will be essential. Only clear pledges of finance that includes substantial public funding, to be directed at the poorest, will persuade them.\nSaleemul Huq, of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said Sharma must also address how poor countries can be helped to cope with the loss and damage they are suffering from global heating. This is a vexed issue at the talks. Some countries see it as a form of compensation to the poor who are bearing the brunt of a climate crisis they did little to cause, but rich countries resist that interpretation.\nHuq said: “Loss and damage clearly attributable to human-induced climate change is unaddressed – an example of how the negotiations around climate change are being made irrelevant by the reality of climate change around the world.”\nPaul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House and now a strategic adviser to the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said: “With governments offering little new money, what’s lacking is a dynamic vision for inducing the private sector to make the trillions in new investments needed to protect developing countries from crippling climate impacts while helping them transition to clean energy.\n“Without such investments, developing countries ravaged by climate change will soon wonder just what they are getting from the Paris agreement, and begin to call more loudly for climate reparations.”\nThe first thing the UK will have to do to gain the trust of developing countries is to show that the $100bn goal is being met. In the run-up to Paris, a close ally of the French government produced a reportshowing that the world was broadly on track to meet the goal, though more was needed. This spurred further promises of funding from developed countries, giving the French government the ability to offer developing country partners reassurances and inducements.\nAt Paris, the French persuaded developing countries to agree that the $100bn goal should be allowed to stand until 2025. Fortunately for the UK – if not for poor countries and the planet – under that timetable the discussions on a larger goal need not conclude for another four years. Sharma made it clear that the UK would only “begin discussions” this year, which means the toughest decisions can be put off.\nEven if the 2020 finance goal is met, however, and developing countries are won over, all the climate finance in the world will fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when vast sums are still pouring into fossil fuels.\nBob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “We need to ensure that the trillions of dollars that are being invested around the world in new infrastructure, particularly in emerging-market countries such as China, India and Indonesia, is consistent with the goal of the Paris agreement. We need the world’s entire financial system to be aligned with Paris.”\nOnly governments can exert the pressure needed across the whole economy. Carney and Sharma face the task of not only wooing developing countries with the promise of new investment flows but also cracking down on the profit-hungry corporations that still see money to be made in ignoring the crisis.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

That is a big concern.\n“This is exactly what scientists have been predicting, with an increase in the frequency of bleaching events.”\nTropical Cyclone Esther crossed the coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria on Monday morning and while the eye of the cyclone was hundreds of kilometres west, the weather system dragged clouds over the reef, helping to cool temperatures slightly.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said late Thursday weather conditions over the next few weeks would “play a key role in determining outcomes for the Reef this summer”.\nCoral bleaching has been occurring on parts of the reef where thermal stress has accumulated the most over summer.\nThe authority said in-shore reefs in the far north had already experienced “widespread bleaching affecting most coral types” but there had been minimal bleaching on outer reefs.\nSo far, only patchy and isolated bleaching had been reported over large parts of the reef, the authority said.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chief scientist Dr David Wachenfeld reports on the status of heat stress and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef on 27 February.\nSkirving said: “The clouds helped because they cooled things off, but there’s still a lot of heat in the system. It’s hot enough for the corals to be accumulating stress.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nHe said the mass bleaching event of 1998 across the reef had taken place over the course of just one week.\nWeak tides for the next week meant there was less mixing of the warmer surface waters with deeper, cooler water.\nSkirving said if Cyclone Esther had not formed, “it would be already bleaching up and down the reef”.\nIn updated analysis, compiled on Wednesday, Skirving wrote that Noaa’s tool for predicting heat stress on corals showed there was an 80% chance that most of the reef would experience some bleaching between 1 March and 8 March.

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, could use the ruling to abandon the project, or the government could draw up a new policy document to approve the runway.\nHeathrow runway ruling prioritises planet over needs of UK plc\nRead more\nThe government is considering its next steps but will not appeal against the verdict. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Our manifesto makes clear any Heathrow expansion will be industry-led. Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity and levelling up across the UK. We also take seriously our commitment to the environment.”\nJohnson has opposed the runway, saying in 2015 that he would “lie down in front of those bulldozers and stop the construction”. Heathrow is already one the busiest airports in the world, with 80 million passengers a year. The £14bn third runway could be built by 2028 and would bring 700 more planes per day and a big rise in carbon emissions.\nJohnson is thought to have been looking for a pretext to withdraw support for the extra runway and could make the argument for Birmingham to provide increased airport capacity for London given that train journey times will be reduced by HS2.\nThe court’s ruling is the first major ruling in the world to be based on the Paris climate agreement and may have an impact both in the UK and around the globe by inspiring challenges against other high-carbon projects.\nLord Justice Lindblom said: “The Paris agreement ought to have been taken into account by the secretary of state. The national planning statement was not produced as the law requires.”\nQuick guide\nHeathrow third runway appeal court ruling - explained\nShow\nWhat just happened?\nFor the first time judges have said that plans for a major infrastructure project are illegal because they breach the UK's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis. This is a groundbreaking legal decision that could effect future infrastructure developments and puts the UK’s commitment to cut emission to net zero by 2050 at the forefront of future policymaking.\nWhat will happen next?\nThe government has been told by the court of appeal to declare its decision to allow Heathrow airport expansion - contained in its airline national policy statement - illegal. Ministers have two choices now. They can withdraw the whole policy statement or try to amend it to make it compatible with the UK’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\nWill the runway be built?\nIf the government can prove that expanding Heathrow is compatible with its commitments under the Paris agreement to very radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the runway may go ahead. But the prime minister has always been against the third runway, and the government has told the court it will not be appealing against its decision on Thursday.\nThere now hangs a very big question mark over whether the bulldozers will ever start work on the runway.\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\n“It’s now clear that our governments can’t keep claiming commitment to the Paris agreement, while simultaneously taking actions that blatantly contradict it” said Tim Crosland, at legal charity Plan B, which brought the challenge. “The bell is tolling on the carbon economy loud and clear.”\nPlan B’s intervention was one of a number of legal challenges against the government’s national policy statement, which gave the go-ahead for the new runway in 2018 after MPs backed it by a large majority. Others were brought by local residents, councils, the mayor of London, and environmental groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace.\nThe challenges were dismissed in the high court in May 2019 but the complainants took their cases to the court of appeal, which delivered its verdicts on Thursday.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nPlan B argued that the Paris agreement target, which the government had ratified, was an essential part of government climate policy and that ministers had failed to assess how a third runway could be consistent with the Paris target of keeping global temperature rise as close to 1.5C as possible.\n“This is an opportunity for Boris Johnson to put Heathrow expansion to bed and focus on the most important diplomatic event of his premiership, the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November,” said Lord Randall, a former Conservative MP and climate adviser to the former prime minister Theresa May. “It’s his chance to shine on the world stage.”\nThe court of appeal did not overturn the high court’s dismissal of the other challenges, which related to air and noise pollution, traffic, and the multibillion pound cost of the runway.\nPlay Video\nGovernment won't appeal against third Heathrow runway verdict, says transport secretary – video\nBut the Paris agreement ruling is far-reaching, according to Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, an international public law expert at Leiden University, in the Netherlands. “Its implications are global,” she said.\n“For the first time, a court has confirmed that the Paris agreement temperature goal has binding effect. This goal was based on overwhelming evidence about the catastrophic risk of exceeding 1.5C of warming. Yet some have argued that the goal is aspirational only, leaving governments free to ignore it in practice.”\nProf Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia, said: “Government needs to put climate targets at the heart all big decisions, or risk missing their own net zero objectives with devastating consequences for climate and stability. I am relieved this is finally recognised in law.”\nClimate campaigner Greta Thunberg said: “Imagine when we all start taking the Paris agreement into account.”\nHeathrow and proponents of the third runway say it would provide an economic boost and is important for international business, particularly after Brexit. “The court of appeal dismissed all appeals against the government – including on ‘noise’ and ‘air quality’ – apart from one, [i.e. climate change] which is eminently fixable,” said a spokeswoman for Heathrow.\n“We will appeal [as an interested party] to the supreme court on this one issue and are confident that we will be successful. Expanding Heathrow, Britain’s biggest port and only hub, is essential to achieving the prime minister’s vision of global Britain. We will get it done the right way.”\nMike Cherry, at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The verdict is a blow to small firms who need greater regional and global connectivity, as well as more opportunities to export.”\nHowever, most flights are taken for pleasure and just 20% of the UK population take more than two-thirds of international flights. Critics say the economic benefits are illusory given, for example, the estimated £10bn of taxpayers’ money needed to alter road and rail links to the airport, and would draw investment towards the south-east.\n“No amount of spin from Heathrow’s PR machine can obscure the carbon logic of a new runway,” said John Sauven, at Greenpeace UK. “Their plans would pollute as much as a small country.”\nGeraldine Nicholson, from local campaign group Stop Heathrow Expansion, said: “This is the final nail in the coffin for Heathrow expansion. We now need to make sure the threat of a third runway does not come back.”\nAt a separate event on Thursday, Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of November’s UN COP26 climate summit, said: “The only economy which can avoid the worst effects of climate change, and thus continue to deliver growth, is a decarbonised economy. Our choices will make or break the zero-carbon economy.”\n• This article was amended on February 28 2020. An earlier version had mistakenly called the business secretary Ashok Sharma, rather than Alok Sharma. This has been corrected.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The Sea, by Miranda Krestovnikoff and Jill Calder, takes us into mangrove swamps and kelp forests and coral reefs. We learn about goblin sharks and vampire squids and a poisonous creature called a nudibranch. Then we reach the final chapter on ocean plastics. When we learn that by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish, Esme bursts into inconsolable tears.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Lost Words, by Robert Macfarlane and Jackie Morris. Photograph: No credit\nSince the deserved success of The Lost Words, a large book filled with beautiful paintings of everyday wildlife by Jackie Morris and “spells” by Robert Macfarlane, which my children loved chanting aloud, bookshops have been filled with other gorgeously illustrated oversized tomes about nature and the environment. There’s Ben Hoare’s gilt-edged Anthology of Intriguing Animals, A Wild Child’s Guide to Endangered Animals by Millie Marotta, and other recent classics such as the lovely How Does My Garden Grow by Dutch author Gerda Muller and A First Book of Nature by Nicola Davies.\nConsumers are spending more money than ever on books for children, and the number of new children’s books about the climate crisis and wildlife has more than doubled over the past year, with sales also doubling, according to data from Nielsen Book Research.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Sea: Exploring our blue planet by Miranda Krestovnikoff (author) and Jill Calder (illustrator). Photograph: Courtesy of Bloomsbury\nThe Greta Thunberg effect is creating a new library of children’s books about eco-warriors. Nosy Crow rushed out Earth Heroes four months after signing up author Lily Dyu, selling 9,000 copies in the UK since publication in October. Macfarlane and Morris have just announced a Lost Words sequel, which will be published this autumn. Bloomsbury is publishing what appears to be the apotheosis of right-on environmentalism for kids in February, Fantastically Great Women Who Saved The Planet, by Kate Pankhurst.\nAdvertisement\nI love reading with my children and I’m passionate about the environment but my inner sceptic wonders if this worthiness explosion is chasing a phantom market. Who wants heavy-handed moral tales for bedtime? What if eco-doom just generates despair? And how many big picture books are dull-but-worthy Christmas presents that lie unread by real children?\nJill Coleman, the director of children’s books at BookTrust, Britain’s largest reading charity, insists the environmental books boom is driven by “a genuine interest and passion from children”, with publishers following their lead. She believes there are many different books that inspire action, rather than despair, and BookTrust offers recommended reading lists of environmental stories for children of all ages.\n“There have always been lots of nature books for kids – wonderful authors like Nicola Davies help children to connect with and understand the natural world – but the recent trend is books which help children think about what they can do,” she says. “Reading is important because it gives children power and agency in all sorts of ways. We need them to feel they can make a difference. I know there are much bigger issues than not buying a plastic bag in a supermarket but when you are nine you can only do what you can do, and you need to feel that you can do something.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Sea: Exploring our blue planet by Miranda Krestovnikoff (author), Jill Calder (illustrator). Photograph: Courtesy of Bloomsbury\nAs well as Earth Heroes, Nosy Crow has sold 12,000 UK copies of How To Help A Hedgehog And Protect A Polar Bear, by Jess French and Angela Keoghan, and later this year will publish YouthQuake by Tom Adams and Sarah Walsh, a book about 50 young people who “shook the world”, invariably featuring Thunberg.\n“It isn’t just a move by publishers, there is a real hunger for it at the moment,” says Kate Wilson, the managing director and co-founder of Nosy Crow. She believes environmentalism is “becoming less siloed” within publishing as environmentally themed books infiltrate many genres, even the cutesy end of fiction for eight-year-olds with Nosy Crow’s reissue of a Holly Webb eco-series (Maya’s Secret, Izzy’s River, Emily’s Dream, Poppy’s Garden). It was originally published in 2012, when “the world was not ready,” as Wilson puts it.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHow To Help A Hedgehog And Protect A Polar Bear by Jess French and Angela Keoghan Photograph: Courtesy of Nosy Crow\nWilson admits there is a risk that children’s publishing becomes overly didactic, pushing a vision of how it wants the world to be “because we have a real commitment to the messages that children are given”. Then again, why wouldn’t we want to encourage care for the planet, Wilson argues: children’s publishers perpetually take moral positions, and “never publish books where bullies win, for instance”.\nAdvertisement\nFor wildlife journalist and author Ben Hoare, the dilemma is the same as that repeatedly expressed by David Attenborough with his epic natural history TV series. Do writers focus on the wonders of nature and thereby inspire young readers or are they duty-bound to cover the planetary extinction crisis and the climate emergency, even when it risks fuelling climate-anxiety at a young age?\nHoare’s lavish Anthology of Intriguing Animals, which has sold in numbers that authors of adult nature writing can only dream of, goes for inspiration with an awareness of global crises. Like many children’s authors, Hoare tested his writing on his own children. “My two girls are adopted and they grew up in totally bookless households for five years. I’ve watched them discover books and reading fairly late compared to their peers. They were reluctant readers so they would’ve found a traditional encyclopedia a turn-off.” Hoare says he tries to add “whimsy, rhyme, alliteration, quirkiness, things that make you smile” to a conventional encyclopedia-type format. “I’ve found that’s what my children really relate to.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nChildren books on wildlife: How To Help A Hedgehog And Protect A Polar Bear by Jess French and Angela Keoghan Photograph: Courtesy of Nosy Crow\nThere is one type of environmental non-fiction Hoare is not a fan of: “Nature activity books that explain how to roll down a hill, look at a sunset or make things out of sticks. Grandparents and parents buy these books because they want to tackle the dreaded screens but I doubt these books get opened. I’m not sure children need to read about these things – just let them go outdoors and discover nature.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAnthology of Intriguing Animals by Ben Hoare. Photograph: Courtesy of DK Children\nAdvertisement\nHe wonders whether fiction is a more powerful vehicle for raising environmental awareness. His own formative childhood reading included Watership Down, Animals of Farthing Wood and Beatrix Potter, who was never “cutesy”. His daughters have been inspired by Enid Blyton’s The Faraway Tree. “Blyton is laughably dated but this idea of a magical tree really had an impact on my girls. It transformed our walks in the woods. We passed a gnarly oak tree and my daughter said, ‘Look, Dad, there’s the faraway tree’. Fiction is quite a stealthy way of talking to children about big themes.”\nLucy Mangan, the author of Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading, agrees. “Very few children up to the age of 11 can or will read straight non-fiction,” she says. “For the young brain, stories are the way to attract attention and get any message across.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLucy Mangan’s Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading. Photograph: Courtesy of Penguin Books\nMangan fears that the moral instruction in environmental non-fiction is too obvious, not least because “there is only one stance that 99% of scientists and writers would want to take so there’s not much room for doing anything with it”. She says: “Children’s literature began with a desire to instruct but if it had stuck to its guns we wouldn’t still be reading it.” The “golden age” of children’s literature only arrived when authors such as J M Barrie to Edith Nesbit cast off Victorian moralising and wrote from a children’s point of view. “Moralising doesn’t get you very far,” argues Mangan.\nEnvironmental fiction for children aged 10 and above and dystopian novels for young adults are also proliferating in this age of anxiety. At BookTrust, Coleman has particularly enjoyed The Dog Runner by Australian author Bren MacDibble (who lost her home in a wildfire) and Run Wild by Gill Lewis, a vet who tackles complex wildlife themes in her books, from the persecution of birds of prey as well as bear-bile farming and endangered gorillas.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nOpening spread of Fantastically Great Women Who Saved the Planet by Kate Pankhurst. Photograph: Courtesy of Bloomsbury\nAdvertisement\nCan this outpouring of environmentalism capture children’s imagination without terrifying them? I test some books on my eight-year-olds. We read Pankhurst’s worthy-sounding Fantastically Great Women Who Saved The Planet. To my surprise, Milly and Esme love it, and I do too: it is funny and interesting, telling stories not just of westerners such as Jane Goodall but also Wangari Maathai, from Kenya, and Isatou Ceesay, from the Gambia. A few days later, Milly tells me they’ve discussed Pankhurst’s story of the Chipko movement in the Indian Himalayas with their teacher. “In the Chipko movement it starts off with one person and then they all protect a whole range of trees from being cut down,” says Milly. “Even a tiny difference makes something big.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFantastically Great Women who Saved the Planet by Kate Pankhurst. Photograph: Courtesy of Bloomsbury\nA few nights later, Milly announces she has read Hoare’s hefty Anthology of Intriguing Animals in one evening. She adores the pages edged in gold. “You’ll learn hundreds of lovely new things from that book,” she says.\nHoare aside, I’m still not convinced by the clunky writing in some of the new eco non-fiction. It seems unfair to pick on one but in Miranda Krestovnikoff’s The Sea, for instance, we learn that kelp, for instance, can grow 30 metres tall. How high is that in real life? How do children relate to that? But my views don’t matter. What do the children think of The Sea? After Esme’s tears over ocean plastics, she consoles herself with its stories of otters. “Everyone should try this book,” she says. “If you read the start you think, ‘meh’ but you’ll learn a lot. It’s really good.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It is a judgment that could have lasting implications for future infrastructure projects.\nThe ruling strikes a warning note that the climate crisis means it can no longer be business as usual.

The make-up of parliament has also changed considerably since the Commons voted in favour of the third runway in 2018.\nThe judges did not cancel the expansion, but they have thrown a big, perhaps insurmountable, obstacle in its path – and given Boris Johnson, who as a backbench MP threatened to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop a third runway, a compelling reason to scrap it.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The country’s rulers were then free to use the money to finance oil development directly, she said.\nGuyana is expected to become one of the world’s largest oil producers after US firm ExxonMobil, along with the consortium partners Hess and China’s state-owned CNOOC, found sites that could deliver 8bn barrels of oil, including in the offshore Stabroek block.\nThe discovery could prompt massive change for a country of only 800,000 people and less than $5,000 in GDP per person in 2018.\nThe consultancy Rystad Energy this month forecast that Guyana’s oil production could reach 1.2m barrels per day by the end of the decade, lifting total annual oil revenues well above $20bn at current prices.\nIt said government income – projected to be about $270m in 2020 – could reach nearly $10bn annually within a decade, far outstripping Guyana’s 2018 GDP of $3.9bn.\nMelinda Janki, an international lawyer challenging oil development in Guyana, asked why the World Bank was not funding cheap renewable energy for the country. She said the institution was “pushing Guyana down a financially disastrous development path”.\nOil production has become a significant issue in the run-up to Guyana’s election in March, after criticism of the incumbent government run by President David Granger.\nThis month Global Witness, a corruption monitor, said a 40-year deal agreed between the government and ExxonMobil for drilling rights would deprive the country of $55bn. The Guyanese opposition has maintained that it would not renegotiate the ExxonMobil contracts.\nA World Bank spokeswoman said: “The World Bank has not provided any financing to develop the Stabroek Block oilfield.”\nShe added that the resources governance project “is aligned with the World Bank’s 2017 One Planet summit announcement that the [World Bank Group] will no longer finance upstream oil and gas, but will continue to help client countries strengthen transparency, governance, institutional capacity, and the energy regulatory environment, including oil and gas.”\n• This article was amended on 28 February 2020 because the Guyanese opposition has not promised to renegotiate the ExxonMobil contracts, as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

To achieve this it will have to cut more greenhouse gas emissions every year than the amount produced by the whole of the UK.\nBP said it would pull out of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), following in the footsteps of Shell and France’s Total, which left the lobby group last April. It will also quit the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and the Western Energy Alliance (WEA).\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nOver the past six months, BP has conducted a review of how its climate crisis-related policies and activities compare with those of 30 trade associations.\nBP cited material differences in its views on carbon pricing in relation to the positions adopted by AFPM and WSPA. It will not renew its WEA membership because of significant differences around the federal regulation of methane.\nLooney said: “BP will pursue opportunities to work with organisations who share our ambitious and progressive approach to the energy transition. And when differences arise we will be transparent. But if our views cannot be reconciled, we will be prepared to part company.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n“My hope is that in the coming years we can add climate to the long list of areas where, as an industry, we work together for a greater good.”\nThe AFPM president and chief executive, Chet Thompson, said: “We are certainly disappointed with BP’s decision. We do not believe that BP’s trade association report accurately reflects AFPM’s position and commitment to finding solutions that address climate change.\n“As an active member of our executive committee, BP knows full well that AFPM recognises that climate change is real and that we are committed to engaging on and developing policies that enable our members to provide the fuels and petrochemicals that humanity needs to thrive in a sustainable way.”\nBP has identified a further five organisations with which it is only partially aligned on the climate crisis, and has told them about these differences. They are the American Petroleum Institute, Australian Institute of Petroleum, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, National Association of Manufacturers and the US Chamber of Commerce.\nThe American Petroleum Institute has lobbied on behalf of oil companies to weaken the landmark US environmental laws enshrined in the the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act, which green groups fear will increase greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the climate crisis. BP also successfully lobbied US policymakers directly for the regulation to be weakened.\nA Guardian investigation revealed last year that five of the world’s largest oil and gas companies – ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total – spend nearly $200m (£153m) every year on lobbying governments to block or water down climate policies. BP spent $53m, including a $13m campaign to successfully derail a proposed carbon tax in Washington state.\nMel Evans, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, was not impressed. “Judge a company by the company they keep. BP are sticking with the American Petroleum Institute, the lobby group who wrecked Obama’s methane restrictions,” she said.\n“When BP remains part of a group whose position they claim to oppose, it’s easier to get clarity on what they really think by looking at where their money is going – more oil, more gas, more climate change.\n“This report appears to be tokenistic, inadequate and hypocritical – like all of BP’s climate plans that we’ve seen so far.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Photograph: Chong Chen\nThe vessel is equipped with robotic arms, probes and cameras – like a manned, underwater version of the Mars rover. In lieu of seats, there’s a padded floor. “So you’re hunched up together with the two pilots who are driving it and manipulating it,” she says.\nWith not even a loo on board, it’s definitely on the bijou side for an eight-hour working day, but for Sigwart, director of the marine laboratory at Queen’s University, Belfast, the experience is worth it.\n“As you go down the light fades out rapidly. When you turn off the lights of the submersible you can see all of the bioluminescence of everything that’s alive in the water all around you – big and small. It’s like a beautiful starscape.”\nWhile much of the ocean floor looks like a ghost town to the naked eye, the concentrated patches of life around hydrothermal vents are as densely, if not as diversely, populated as coral reefs.\nThe vents are where mineral-rich hot water, between 300C and 400C (572-752F), bursts out from below the Earth’s crust, swirling into the cold seawater like black smoke. “These smoking chimneys loom up at you, out of the blackness. They’re just incredible,” says Sigwart.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nMineral-rich hot water bursts out of of the Earth’s crust through hydrothermal vents. Photograph: GeoMar\nOne current evolutionary hypothesis is that the special conditions around deep-sea thermal vents sparked the beginnings of life on Earth.\nBut these rare and vital ecosystems are under serious threat from deep-sea mining for minerals such as zinc, used for car batteries and mobile phone circuit boards, say campaigners. You might expect that in open water, which does not belong to anyone, the seabed would be safe from commodification, but in 2019 Greenpeace reported that 30 floor-exploration licences had been granted worldwide by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body.\nQ&A\nWhat is deep-sea mining?\nShow\nDeep-sea mining is the process of retrieving mineral deposits from the deep sea – the area of the ocean below 200 metres, which is the largest and least explored environment on Earth, occupying 65% of the planet’s surface. Metals found there such as copper, nickel, aluminium, lithium, cobalt and mangen are increasingly needed to make batteries, smartphones and solar panels.\nWhen will it happen?\nSo far, 30 exploration licences have been granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body. In total, 1.5m km2 has been set aside for mineral exploration (equivalent to an area the size of Mongolia) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as along the mid-Atlantic ridge. No exploitation contracts have yet been allocated but they are expected to be given out as early as this year when ISA’s Mining Code is expected to be approved. This will be a set of rules “to regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals in the international seabed area”.\nWhy is it a problem?\nCritics are concerned mining could do huge damage to the deep sea and the creatures and ecosystems that exist there. Underwater ecosystems like volcanic mountains, hydrothermal vents and deep-sea trenches are still poorly understood. Many endemic deep-sea species could be wiped out by the creation of a single large mine, while more mobile creatures will be indirectly affected by noise and light pollution.\nWhat can be done?\nComprehensive studies need to be carried out to assess the potential damage to biodiversity before deep-sea mining goes ahead, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fundamentally, the IUCN also says people need to recycle and reuse products so there is less demand for extraction of natural resources. Researchers have created a list of priorities for deep-sea conservation. The survey, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, included the responses of 112 scientists.\nPhoebe Weston\nWas this helpful?\nMining companies in Germany, China, Korea, India and the UK are among the recipients. “They’re not supposed to be used for commercial-scale mining, but several of the licences have been renewed and they’re into a second 10-year term, says Sigwart, adding that the ISA is currently developing a regulatory framework for commercial mining in the high seas.\nThe race is now on for Sigwart and other biologists to identify and learn more about the vent-dwelling creatures and lobby for their protection. Many are only found in these unique and isolated places. The vivid mottled orange snail, Gigantopelta aegis, has only been located in one area estimating 8km squared.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Gigantopelta aegis is now classified as ‘critically endangered’. Photograph: GeoMar\nElin Thomas, Sigwart’s PhD student, has set to work assessing the vent species discovered so far against the criteria for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s red list. Because of its small, singular habitat and the threat of mining in the Indian Ocean, the Gigantopelta aegis is now classified as “critically endangered”.\nAnother colourful character on the vent scene is Alviniconcha strummeri, named after the Clash’s Joe Strummer on account of its spiky shell resembling punk rockers. Its red list status is “vulnerable”.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAlviniconcha strummeri, named after Joe Strummer of the Clash. Photograph: Anders Waren/Courtesy of Swedish Museum of Natural History\nIn total, 15 hydrothermal vent species – described fondly as “super weird” by Sigwart – have been added to the red rist. The mythical-looking sea pangolin, AKA the scaly-foot snail, was the first to be identified as at risk (status: “vulnerable”). Resplendent in armoured skirts that would be the envy of any Roman centurion, the layers of black flaps around its foot, along with its helmet-like black shell, are a result of the very mineral riches that are attracting the mining industry.\n“The iron that precipitates out of the vent fluid,” says Sigwart, “is incorporated into the shell and the scales of the scaly foot. It hasn’t grown an iron shell, but the available environmental iron on the surface has integrated into it.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe scaly-foot snail, or sea pangolin, was one of the first hydrothermal vent species to be identified as at risk. Photograph: JAMSTEC\nThe scaly-foot snail and Gigantopelta aegis are the most fascinating to Sigwart, because each has independently evolved a cunning way to bypass the whole kerfuffle of having to eat. All life around the vents depends on bacteria for energy. There are no plants, so the creatures have to either graze on slimy microbial mats, or eat each other. Rather than bother with any of that, however, these two evolutionary geniuses have an internal organ inside which microbes live, providing all their energy needs.\nNext generation ‘may never see the glory of coral reefs’\nRead more\nIt’s not all snails and germs down there, however. There are giant ghostly white crabs scuttling about, stalked barnacles, tube worms, shrimps and mussels. Different vent systems around the world have their own assemblages of animals. The first vents, discovered in the late 1970s, were in the east Pacific and are known for their metre-long lipstick worms.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nEvolutionary biologist Julia Sigwart. Photograph: Chong Chen\nIn Sigwart’s experience, people often assume these ecosystems are “out of harm’s way, nobody can reach them. It’s all fine. But it’s no longer fine, because now we’re on a path to developing commercial-scale deep-sea mining and vents are a target. We can no longer naively hope that the depths of the oceans are still pristine and untouched.”\nWhy sushi could be the solution to a sea urchin invasion\nRead more\n“More and more,” says Sigwart, “it’s clear that they are already impacted by human activities. We find plastic in deep-sea sediments, the ocean circulation patterns are being altered by global climate change.”\nCrucially, she says, the tide is turning when it comes to scientists becoming more vocal about the animals that would otherwise stay out of sight and out of mind. “Deep-sea biology is fascinating and exciting, and it inspires a sense of wonder in everybody,” says Sigwart.\n“There are very few of us that have the privilege of actually working on these animals and habitats. We have a burden of responsibility to try to explain them to other people before the damage is done.”\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The fourth was more mysterious, and I set out on a journey to try to understand it.\nIn my teenage years, I had developed an aptitude for drinking, as many adolescents do. But it was while working as a music journalist in my 20s that my addictions accelerated. By April 2012, at the age of 27, I was on my knees. I knew that the drink and drugs had to go: the highs were getting harder to achieve; the lows were becoming more dangerous, more self-destructive. I knew my mental and physical health were deteriorating, but I couldn’t seem to stop or cut down. After months of trying to do this alone, I found a rehabilitation programme and set out on a path to sobriety.\nI had time on my hands, weekends loomed large and I needed to keep busy. So I started walking, wandering daily on Walthamstow Marshes in north-east London to watch the kestrels, caterpillars and the shaggy old heron. It made me feel safe and secure. Gradually, I realised that my mind needed these walks and I grew to rely on them. The natural world had become a kind of rehab: it soothed my rawness and patched me back together.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn autumnal scene at the Walthamstow Wetlands in north-east London. Photograph: Ray Wise/Getty Images\nIn those very early sober months, when I was learning to live without the crutches I had used for years, I felt as if I was walking around without skin. The critical inner voices that had contributed to my periods of mental illness had folded me into myself. But on the marshes, I started to look up and outwards. Even though I was usually alone when I walked, I never felt lonely. I was realising that I belonged to a wider family of species, the matrix of life, from the spiders to the lichen and the cormorants to the coots. Nature picked me up by the scruff of my neck, and I rested in her care for a while.\nAdvertisement\nWith the kind of urgent desire I had once had for mind-altering substances and music, I was now drawn to trees, birds, flowers and plants . I understood that time in nature softened the voices in my head and stabilised my mood, but I didn’t, at the beginning, understand what was happening to my body, brain and mind. I hadn’t realised that the essence of nature – the geometry, the scents, the sounds, the colours, the textures, the chemical makeup – could have such a life-changing power but, quite quickly, this became apparent.\nI began to plant things to watch them grow. One of the first things I noticed was that after gardening, digging my hands deep into the soil, I felt happy, upbeat, less stressed and generally more positive. Reading up on this, I saw that there may be a biological reason for it. One of the species of bacteria found in soil, M vaccae, has been found to affect the brain and increase stress resilience. In 2004, lung cancer patients at the Royal Marsden hospital in Surrey who were given an immunisation containing the bacteria reported feeling happier. As Dr Christopher Lowry, one of the leading neuroscientists in the field, said at the time: “These studies leave us wondering if we should all spend more time playing in the dirt.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nContact with bacteria in soil has been found to increase resilience to stress.

We are woven into the land, and wider ecosystems, more than we realise. Crucially, these old friends that we evolved with are able to treat or block chronic inflammation, which can also affect the brain and have a direct impact on mood. Studies have shown that spending just two hours in a forest can significantly lower levels of cytokines – an inflammation biomarker – in the blood, which could be caused by exposure to important organisms.\nIt is all very well thinking about how more connection with the natural world would make people happier and healthier. But it is all the more pressing given the situation we find ourselves in. How can forest bathing be prescribed when forests are threatened and diminishing across the world? How can people spend more time in green spaces when many of our parks are in decline?\nAs I fell in love with the trees and the soil, I began to see how endangered much of nature had become, and how these opportunities to commune with other species were slipping through our fingers. Alongside our disconnection from nature is, of course, the fact that the natural world is rapidly vanishing; our time on this Earth is haunted by habitat destruction, species loss and climate breakdown. While revelling in the glory of the rest of nature, I also fell into a state of ecological grief, the name for the psychological response to the nature and climate emergency; a mourning for the communities, wildlife and landscapes that are disappearing and a fear of what is to come. Of course, people in many countries – including Britain’s flooded areas – are already suffering directly from the impact of the climate emergency. Others are experiencing anxiety, worry and dread about an anticipated future of ecological loss.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe more I learned about the benefits a connection to nature can have on our minds, the more it seemed appalling that access to nature is so threatened in some places. The destruction of ancient woodlands across the country; the felling of much-loved street trees in Sheffield and other urban areas; children barely given opportunities to play in woods, fields and parks; the legislation that is failing to protect our rivers, streams and wild places; and the fact that the UK will miss almost all its biodiversity targets that were set a decade ago.\nSpending time in restorative natural environments is dependent, partly, on weather, which is in flux. A study of antidepressants by the environmental psychologist Terry Hartig has suggested that colder summers may constrain restorative activities that reduce stress and depressive symptoms. Rates of SSRI prescriptions increased for men and women in an unseasonably cooler July in Sweden. At the other extreme, emerging evidence links potentially dangerous high temperatures to increased mental health problems, illness and suicide.\nAdvertisement\nFor those on the frontline of the climate crisis, the mental health impacts of ecological loss are already severe. In Kulusuk, Greenland, where the ice has melted, rates of depression, suicide and alcoholism have risen. In the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada, residents report feeling stressed, depressed and anxious because of the melted ice and changing weather patterns. It strikes at the very heart of identity. Farmers in the Australian wheat belt, whose farms have blown away in dust storms, have compared losing their farms to a death.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDiversity and richness of birdsong is linked to decreased stress and a quicker recovery of a balanced nervous system. Photograph: Fireglo2/Getty Images/iStockphoto\nAs Glenn Albrecht, the Australian academic who coined the term “solastalgia”, to describe the distress caused by environmental change, points out, what is disordered isn’t ecological grief, eco-anxiety or global dread but “the world that is causing you to feel that way”. It is a natural response to loss – and it is likely to become more common.\nOur relationship with nature, even if it could be restored, isn’t quite as simple as a soothing, serene ramble in the wild. The wild barely exists. So what is the effect of biodiversity loss on our minds, our inner selves, and the collective psyche?\nWhen we walk in the woods, or by a lake, or spend time in a garden or park, evidence suggests that our parasympathetic nervous system is more likely to be activated. This is responsible for the “rest and digest” processes at work inside your body, associated with feelings of contentment, sleep and safety. The sympathetic nervous system’s main function is to stimulate the body’s reaction to stress, and ignore any non-essential business, such as immune function. Ideally, we want a balanced nervous system.\nAfter exposure to nature, our stress-recovery response is faster and more complete when compared with exposure to built environments. This has important consequences for our health at a time when stress-related diseases are on the increase. It also suggests that if we, as a society, are allowing trees to be cut down, or natural spaces in urban areas to be paved over, we are acting in a way that is damaging to public health. We need nature in order to recover from the stresses of life.\nResearch shows that green space seems to have a buffering effect on the stresses of an urban area\nAdvertisement\nThere are many studies that link natural sounds – particularly diversity and richness of bird song – to decreased stress and a quicker recovery of a balanced nervous system. Even people under anaesthetic have been found to produce fewer chemical biomarkers associated with stress – such as amylase in saliva – when played a recording of soft wind or birdsong.\nA few years into my research, I had a baby and moved to a town in Hampshire. Near my new home, I found a beautiful, wild cemetery containing ancient ruins, where a majestic beech tree shines batter-yellow in the autumn sun. Rabbits flicker in the long grass, occasionally stopping long enough so I can see the black inkwells of their eyes; goblets of ancient epiphytes decorate the brick walls. When I look closer at the yellow blotches of lichen with my pocket microscope, I see tiny cities made of gold, with depth and dimension and cherry-red microscopic bugs invisible to the naked eye.\nThe science of awe was first considered by a psychologist called Dacher Keltner at the University of California at Berkeley in a landmark paper published in 2003. Many experiences of awe in the modern world still come from an encounter with nature, despite our disconnection from it. Keltner found that awe increases happiness and lowers stress, perhaps unsurprisingly, but he also discovered just how powerful an experience of awe can be to the body and mind. The lab found that people were more ethical, kind and generous after feeling awe. Why? Perhaps from simply being in a good mood. But using functional MRI to look at the brains of participants, scientists saw that awe reduced activity in the default mode network, the area of the brain associated with a sense of self. It reminded me of a phenomenon I had heard about from recovering addicts: “addiction.fm” or the “washing-machine head”. In other words, the self-centred, negative ruminations that a substance can hush temporarily but, in the long run, will only feed. I visited the cemetery with renewed vim, searching for moments of awe and finding them everywhere.\nAround that time, I got postnatal depression and there was a frightening period when nature didn’t touch the sides. I felt nothing in the wild spaces that had previously brought me wonder and succour. But after medical help, I found that taking a walk through the cemetery instead of down a busy, polluted road, made me feel noticeably calmer and lighter. I was drawn to the effulgent green moss, the old, sprawling yews, the buzz of spotting a nuthatch or goldcrest or sparrowhawk.\nIt turns out that these walks may have been affecting my brain in immediate and significant ways. Researchers in Edinburgh asked a group of people to walk from a busy urban space to a public park, or vice versa. Both groups started with a high stress response. What was interesting was how green space seemed to have a buffering effect on the stresses of the urban area. Those who started in green space and walked into a busy built-up space experienced an increase in alpha brainwaves – the electrical activity of the brain associated with relaxation. Nature seemed to undo the stress of the city, in the moment.\nWhen I started on this journey, I might have said that a relationship or connection with the rest of nature isn’t for everyone; that some people just don’t like the outdoors. But, in fact, research shows that background nature is essential across the population for good mental health. Without access to natural landscapes, rich in biodiversity, our potential for restoration, peace and psychological nourishment is sorely degraded.\nIf we feel it, we can be galvanised by our ecological grief. We need a new relationship with the Earth, one that positions us not as conquerors, but co-tenants with wildlife and rivers and mountains and trees, respecting and caring for natural spaces because it is the right thing to do – and because we need the rest of nature for our lives and for our sanity.\nLosing Eden: Why Our Minds Need The Wild by Lucy Jones is published by Allen Lane on 27 February\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

She is one of the few farmers here who has stayed with the traditional crop over the decades. Many other farmers in Nagaland, the majority of whom are women, have stopped growing it due to a lack of demand.\nWhite rice, easily available both in markets and via the government public distribution system – which sells it at a subsidised rate – is preferred by consumers across the state.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBut growing rice requires large quantities of water, which makes it vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis.\nFaced with a changing climate, Thurr and other farmers are now working to bring millet back to the region and encourage more people to eat it.\nThurr joined the Millet Farmers Group, created by the Nagaland chapter of North East Network (NEN), a women’s rights non-profit organisation.\nThrough the network, 200 millet farmers from 11 villages in the district of Phek are sharing knowledge, increasing their output, and accessing new markets. Thurr says she has seen her yields increase since she joined the group.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBaked goods prepared from millet flour at a farmers’ market in Kohima, Nagaland’s capital\nNEN Nagaland also provides interest-free loans of between 1,500 and 2,000 rupees (£16 and £21) to millet farmers. And it is trying to build demand for the grain, including producing a cookbook featuring baked goods, fried snacks, sweets and pancakes – all made from millet flour – aimed at a younger urban audience.\n“Before joining NEN and the Millet Farmers Group, the millet I grew was only for my family. With the increased production, I now have a surplus which I’m able to sell,” says Thurr. “This money is very helpful towards meeting our household expenses as well as for our medical needs.”\nWekoweu Tsuhah, the Nagaland state director of the network, says: “Rice farmers here were already affected by climate change. We’ve had erratic rainfall, rising temperatures, new pests and new crop diseases. So, in 2010–11, we began focusing on millet farming as a way to ensure food security and build climate resilience.\nAdvertisement\n“Millet needs very little water, grows well on poor soil, is fast growing and suffers from very few diseases. Once harvested, it stores well for years. We see growing millet as a tool to empower local women farmers in the face of climate change.”\nFoxtail is the most commonly cultivated type of millet in the region, but other varieties such as sorghum, proso and pearl are also being grown to ensure diversity. Many farmers grow crops to feed their families but some of the bigger producers also sell their output.\nAs well as trying to improve access to markets, NEN Nagaland has helped some of the women to buy dehusking machines. Without access to these machines farmers had to dehusk the grain manually, which put many off millet as a crop.\n“For years after I resumed millet farming in 2013, I did not have a dehusking machine. I had to manually pound the grain to dehusk it. It took up a lot of my time and energy as I had no help – these activities are considered to be a woman’s job. But I persisted. It was important to me to cultivate this traditional crop,” says Povelu Shijo, a farmer from Phuhgi village.\n'The dates are drying': profits shrivel for farmers as the heat rises in Tunisia\nRead more\nIn 2018, with the support of NEN Nagaland, Shijo was able to buy a dehusking machine at a subsidised rate from the government. Inspired by her enthusiasm, Povelu’s entire village is now growing millet.\nIn Akhegwo village, Chutso and her Millet Farmers Group are allowed to cultivate on village land, rent-free. “We already knew of the nutritional benefits of millet,” she says. “But now that NEN has made us aware of its ecological value, our farmer’s group is focusing on seed production.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nLhouvezü-ü Lasuh harvests foxtail millet at her farm in Nagaland\nAdvertisement\nLast year, the group harvested between 130 to 150kg of seeds, which were distributed to the community.\n“This year, millet farming will happen on a larger scale in our village. We will start sowing soon,” adds Chutso.\nIn Sumi, the village council rewards the farmer with the highest millet production with a cash prize of 2,000 rupees.\nThurr says she is happy that young farmers in her village have started to grow millet again. Not only is it generating income, it is reclaiming its cultural significance. “I received millet as a wedding present from my parents and I’ve gifted each of my four daughters 10 baskets of millet at their weddings.”\nWekoweu adds: “By reviving millet farming, we are not only preserving our traditional knowledge, we are also preparing for an uncertain future.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

For them coal is more like a herpes sore: Labor’s got it, they are not going to get rid of it, they don’t want to talk about it, but they will be duty bound to ’fess up to their condition before they can expect anyone to kiss them. Ergh.\nIn this context, securing an alliance to win government becomes a challenging two-step. First, Labor must convince heartland communities that action on climate change does not render them collateral damage. Then they will need to convince progressives that maintaining the coal industry does not render them incapable of meaningful climate action.\nOpposition leader Anthony Albanese has begun to confront the issue head on in recent weeks, bringing the party into line with global and state governments with a 2050 target for net zero carbon emissions while asserting an ongoing role for coal exports in the economy.\nAs this week’s Essential report shows, the first part of this formulation is not controversial, with the long-term zero target is accepted among the vast majority of voters. Indeed, Coalition support for net zero has shifted net 24 points in just a month: https://essentialvision.com.au/climate-change-policy-proposals.\nDespite the broad public sentiment, the Coalition can sniff division, seizing on these targets as a blunt instrument, with the “cost of action” mantra re-emerging amid threats of rural Armageddon.\nBut it’s not just Labor supporting the zero by 2050 mechanism. Independent Zali Steggall has introduced a private members bill to this effect. In the unlikely event that the bill ever sees the light of day, there will be a cohort of Coalition MPs who will be forced to make a call between backing in the global benchmark or staying on the side of denial. Fun times for them, to be avoided at all cost.\nBut given the 2050 target is endorsed by everyone from the NSW premier to Tory PM Boris Johnson, landing on the long-term target may be the easy part of Labor’s coal conundrum.\nComing up with a way of keeping faith with progressives, particularly younger people demanding urgent action that includes the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector, will be the real challenge.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nNew Greens leader Adam Bandt’s response to Albanese’s weekend media where he accepted a long-term future for coal exports is instructive: “Scott Morrison loves coal, but it seems Anthony Albanese does too,” he tweeted. “If Labor thinks we’ll be mining and selling thermal coal in 2050, they’re not serious about climate change or ‘zero emissions’.”\nBut even in this attack, Bandt is using nuance, distinguishing “thermal coal” used to produce electricity with “metallurgical” or “coking” coal, which still is a necessary ingredient for producing steel.\nShining a light on this nuance may be the way through.\nIt starts with being open about what decarbonisation really means: a long-term transition in energy that will see coal-fired power replaced by renewable technologies at both a local and global level. Over time it may also see new technology, such as hydrogen, replacing coal in steel production, although that technology is still nascent.\nFor now, the transition means thinking through the next phase of government investment in energy, where the debate over new coal-fired power is critical and the points of difference between the government and opposition most stark.\nWhat should give the opposition leader some succour in embracing the C-word is that voters are ready to accept this sort of nuance. When given the choice, nearly half support a staged phase out of coal-fired power plants, rather than a rapid shutdown or taxpayer-funded life support.\nAdvertisement\nBut the debate on coal can’t stop there. Labor needs to be upfront that coal exports are central to the Australian economy and prosperity, with steel critical to the development of our neighbours. In this context, differentiating types of coal and recognising the importance of this trade, when resources account for 60% of our export income, is crucial.\nFinally, Labor can make the case to those who demand an immediate end to coal exports that this is outside the global frameworks that they champion, that the path to global abatement will come from domestic targets, not a unilateral closure of international trade. Playing a meaningful role in the evolution of the global framework, rather than sabotaging the process as the current government does, is the best way to ensure that exports taper off.\nNone of these debates are easy to mount, or popular for those who see the moral imperative to act in black and white terms. But engaging progressives by talking about coal as a resource to be managed and not as poison to be banned seems the only way through the morass.\nOf course, by taking a middle track, Labor risks being wedged. When the political debate on climate action is reduced to a binary proposition on coal – for or against – the tightrope is impossible for Labor to walk. It’s not only politically fraught but nonsensical in practice.\nNet zero emissions by 2050: is it a controversial ambition and will the Coalition adopt it?\nRead more\nBut by confronting the complexity of coal, its importance to the economy, the difference between domestic and export use, Labor can bring the discussion back down to earth, and in doing so, offer its credentials to lead Australia through this complex transition.\nAfter all, the 2050 net zero target will require transformation across many industries beyond energy, and what could be worse than a culture war every time? Trucks: for or against? Beef: for or against? And so on. It was a tantalising glimpse of climate wars 2.0 when agriculture minister David Littleproud posited that Labor’s net zero target meant “most of the national herd would likely have to go”.\nThe problem with so much of the climate debate is that it is defined by slogans rather than nuance. “Kill coal”, while an eventual consequence of energy transition, is not a theory of change.\nClimate change is too big a challenge for slogans on either side of the debate. Finding a pathway to decarbonise the economy starts with changing government, and that will be even harder if Labor can’t use the C-word. Despite the sometimes deafening noise, our numbers suggest there are plenty of Australians open to a discussion about coal that’s not just black and white.\n• Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.\nWas this helpful?\nSources told the news agency that the statement of priorities included the importance of examining the implications of global heating for financial stability, as part of the work of the G20’s Financial Stability Board, the steering group for international banking industry rules.\nThe language represented a compromise to overcome opposition from US officials at the first major meeting of Saudi Arabia’s year-long presidency of the G20, according to the sources. An attempt to include references to the downside risks for global growth posed by the climate crisis was dropped.\nConcerns about the economic damage from rising global temperatures and extreme weather events have risen up the agenda among world leaders, central bankers and financiers in recent years. The financial system continues to fund activities that are inconsistent with meeting climate targets, paving the way for trillions of pounds of financial losses in the future and catastrophic environmental consequences should the world economy fail to adapt.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nThe meetings in Riyadh were attended by Mark Carney, who has driven the climate emergency up the agenda among world leaders and financial regulators to stake a legacy at the Bank of England before he stands down as governor next month.

However, the increasing focus comes as US officials resist naming global heating as an economic risk, following Trump’s move at the outset of his presidency to withdraw the world’s largest economy from the Paris climate accords.\n• This article was amended on 26 February 2020.

In Doncaster, where the Fishlake area was flooded in November, nearly 4,000 homes are intended for such flood zones.\nThe government is facing renewed calls to review its housing strategy as experts, local authorities and insurers warn that building on floodplains is increasing the danger to thousands of people from extreme storms such as Ciara and Dennis, which climate scientists say will become more commonplace.\nThe government aims to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s to help ease a chronic housing shortage across the UK. Yet local authorities say they are struggling to meet these demands because of a dearth of available land, leading to as many as one in 10 new homes being built on high-risk flood sites since 2013.\nDr Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said the government’s housing policy was “literally planning for disaster”. He added: “Why are we planning to build more homes in high-risk flood areas when we know that the situation is only going to get worse because of the climate emergency?”\nA joint investigation by the Guardian and Greenpeace’s Unearthed news unit found that of the 11,410 new homes planned across seven flood-stricken English authorities, 1,479 are in four of the areas hit hardest by Storms Ciara and Dennis: Calderdale, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcester.\nIn three regions hit by severe flooding before Christmas – Doncaster, Sheffield and Central Lincolnshire – a further 9,931 new homes are to be built on high-risk flood land. The government defines high-risk areas as having a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any year.\nAdvertisement\nThe data was unearthed by cross-referencing local planning documents and street-level addresses with the government’s national map of flood zones.\nBuilding on land prone to flooding is a risk to new homeowners and compounds the danger for surrounding areas, experts have said, as floodwater that could otherwise be soaked up by green space instead runs quickly off concrete and into rivers.\nIn Herefordshire, which experienced unprecedented flooding last week as the River Wye rose to the highest level since 1795, 325 homes are earmarked for high-risk flood zones over the next few years. Some of this land has already been left underwater by Storm Dennis, according to the Herefordshire council leader, David Hitchiner.\nJohn Harrington, the council’s cabinet member for infrastructure and transport, described the government’s housing policy as “completely and utterly flawed” and that it was forcing local authorities to approve “idiotic” developments on floodplains so they can meet demands from Whitehall.\n“Central government just say: ‘There’s a housing target, now go do it.’ It’s really quite stupid. It’s devolving responsibility without giving the authority any power or money to deal with the situation. It is absolutely unacceptable,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nConcerns have also been raised that homeowners who buy new properties on at-risk land are in “potential insurance blackspots” as they are not eligible for cover under the government’s Flood Re insurance scheme, potentially leaving them liable for crippling costs in the event of damage.\nThe Association of British Insurers said building on unprotected floodplains was “simply storing up problems for the future” and that stricter checks and sanctions should be introduced to stop developers from finding ways round planning regulations.\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need, and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding. Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTemporary flood barriers hold back the River Severn in Ironbridge, Shropshire. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\nAdvertisement\nScott Cardwell, Doncaster council’s assistant director for economy and development, said the council was only identifying areas in flood zones for housing where they already have planning permission and are “deliverable, viable, and safe”. He added: “They have all complied with national planning policy and the sequential and exceptions tests and have had site-specific flood risk assessments and mitigation agreed in conjunction with the Environment Agency and lead local flood authority.”\nIn the valley of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which has been hit by three major floods in eight years, the council’s leader, Tim Swift, said it had removed some sites at high risk of flooding from its local plan after a risk assessment. However, he said that where houses were still proposed for flood-risk sites they would not be developed “until measures have been put in place to ensure that they are safe”.\nSome council leaders have raised doubts about the efficacy of the measures used by developers to mitigate the flood risk of new homes, such as “sustainable urban drainage systems”. Some have said that paving over absorbent land simply exacerbates the problems downstream.\nParr called for government to rethink its housing policy and give more powers to environmental watchdogs “to keep developers in check”.\nHe added: “It’s high time both local and central government started treating the climate emergency as if it was real – because it is.\n“One of the problems is that by cutting the budgets of both local authorities and the Environment Agency, the government has effectively tilted the playing field in favour of developers. We have a housing policy that tends to put housebuilders’ profits before people’s chances of not seeing their homes underwater.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The one Rishi Sunak will deliver in just over two weeks’ time may be one of the few that justifies the hype.\nThe reason so much is resting on the shoulders of the tyro chancellor is that the budget needs to satisfy a number of different audiences: the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who gave Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority; traditional Conservative voters; the financial markets; and foreign governments looking to see whether the UK will take a lead before the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November.\nA package that pushes all the necessary buttons is not going to be easy. To take one example, making tax relief on pension contributions less generous for those on higher incomes would help the chancellor’s sums add up and win credibility with the financial markets but antagonise the Tory party’s natural supporters.\nAdvertisement\nSunak’s immediate task is to announce targets for the public finances that are easier to hit than the ones currently in place, but not so weak that the markets take fright.\nMoving the goalposts will give the government more scope to borrow for infrastructure projects that need to be underway soon if they are to be completed in time to deliver a political dividend for Johnson at the next general election.\nBut unless he can also find a way of making the budget consistent with the government’s 2050 net zero carbon target for the economy a diplomatic failure of catastrophic proportions looms at the end of the year.\nThe Cop26 is the most important summit the UK has hosted since the G8 met at Gleneagles in 2005 – and the task facing the government is much more daunting than it was then.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nThe Gleneagles summit was all about the rich countries of the west agreeing to provide debt relief and higher levels of aid for poor nations. Most of the debts would never have been paid anyway and the doubling of aid was easily affordable at a time when the global economy was booming.\nEven so, it took a lot of time and effort to chisel out a deal. The then prime minister, Tony Blair, and the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, both lobbied hard to overcome resistance to their plan, expending plenty of political capital in the process. Public opinion – channeled through the Make Poverty History campaign – was effectively mobilised. Crucially, the Labour government showed leadership by committing to the UN target to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.\nA deal in Glasgow is going to be immensely more difficult than it was up the road in Perthshire 15 years ago. For a start, there are many more countries involved. For another, some of the biggest players are actively hostile to the idea of setting tougher emissions targets. The contrast between George W Bush – who was interested in Africa – and the climate emergency denier who currently occupies the White House is stark. But the US is not going to be alone in Glasgow: Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia will all prove hard to break down.\nAfter failing to persuade David Cameron to do the job, Johnson has put the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in charge of summit preparations. But Sharma does not have the heavy-hitting international reputation that is going to impress other governments. That will require Johnson to demonstrate his personal commitment to making Glasgow a success.\nAll of which brings us back to the budget, which provides an opportunity for the government to announce measures that will accelerate the UK’s progress towards a decarbonised economy. These need to be more than the mooted increase in fuel duty.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nThe Green New Deal Group (of which I am a member) has estimated it will cost about £100bn a year for 20 years to make the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Investment on that sort of scale would be necessary to make the UK’s 30m buildings energy efficient, turn buildings into power stations through the use of solar panels, and invest in renewable energy.\nSo where’s the money going to come from? One answer would be a form of green quantitative easing – money creation by the Bank of England that would pay for the decarbonisation of the economy rather than, as was the case during and after the financial crisis, being pumped into the banking system. The government doesn’t seem keen on this approach, even though there are plenty of economists who think it is wholly feasible.\nAnother possibility would be for the government to borrow the money in the usual way, but this doesn’t appeal to ministers either.\nThere is, though, a third option. At present about £100bn year is paid into pension schemes, all of it eligible for tax relief currently worth £54bn a year. There is also tax relief on the £70bn a year invested in Isas. The GND proposal is that 25% of pension contributions should go into green new deal investment in exchange for that tax relief and that all new Isa contributions – which currently go into cash or shares – should be invested in green new deal bonds issued by the government at a guaranteed rate of interest.\nThe idea is to provide a stream of income to transform the economy as well as offering a new secure investment vehicle for savers. Insurance companies and pension funds no longer risk being left with stranded fossil fuel assets and the City would be the place to do green finance. Above all, a strong signal of intent would be sent to the rest of the world.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

When I was pregnant with Greta, and working in Germany, Svante was acting at three different theatres in Sweden simultaneously. I had several years of binding contracts ahead of me at various opera houses all over Europe. With 1,000km between us, we talked over the phone about how we could get our new reality to work.\nSign up for Bookmarks: discover new books in our weekly email\nRead more\n“You’re one of the best in the world at what you do,” Svante said. “And as for me, I am more like a bass player in the Swedish theatre and can very easily be replaced. Not to mention you earn so damned much more than I do.” I protested a little half-heartedly but the choice was made.\nA few weeks later we were at the premiere for Don Giovanni at the Staatsoper in Berlin and Svante explained his current professional status to Daniel Barenboim and Cecilia Bartoli.\n“So now I’m a housewife.”\nWe carried on like that for 12 years. It was arduous but great fun. We spent two months in each city and then moved on. Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam, Barcelona. Round and round. We spent the summers in Glyndebourne, Salzburg or Aix-en-Provence. As you do when you’re good at singing opera and other classical music. I rehearsed 20 to 30 hours a week and the rest of the time we spent together.\nBeata was born three years after Greta and we bought a Volvo V70 so we’d have room for doll’s houses, teddy bears and tricycles. Those were fantastic years. Our life was marvellous.\nOne evening in the autumn of 2014, Svante and I sat slumped on our bathroom floor in Stockholm. It was late, the children were asleep. Everything was starting to fall apart around us. Greta was 11, had just started fifth grade, and was not doing well. She cried at night when she should be sleeping. She cried on her way to school. She cried in her classes and during her breaks, and the teachers called home almost every day. Svante had to run off and bring her home to Moses, our golden retriever. She sat with him for hours, petting him and stroking his fur. She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness and little by little, bit by bit, she seemed to stop functioning. She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.\nAdvertisement\nWe sat there on the hard mosaic floor, knowing exactly what we would do. We would change everything. We would find the way back to Greta, no matter the cost. The situation called for more than words and feelings. A closing of accounts. A clean break.\n“How are you feeling?” Svante asked. “Do you want to keep going?”\n“No.”\n“OK. Fuck this. No more,” he said. “We’ll cancel everything. Every last contract,” Svante went on. “Madrid, Zurich, Vienna, Brussels. Everything.”\nOne Saturday soon afterwards, we decide we’re going to bake buns, all four of us, the whole family, and we’re determined to make this work. It has to. If we can bake our buns as usual, in peace and quiet, Greta will be able to eat them as usual, and then everything will be resolved, fixed. It’s going to be easy as pie. Baking buns is after all our favourite activity. So we bake, dancing around in the kitchen so as to create the most positive, happiest bun-baking party in human history.\nBut once the buns are out of the oven the party stops in its tracks. Greta picks up a bun and sniffs it. She sits there holding it, tries to open her mouth, but… can’t. We see that this isn’t going to work.\n“Please eat,” Svante and I say in chorus. Calmly, at first. And then more firmly. Then with every ounce of pent-up frustration and powerlessness. Until finally we scream, letting out all our fear and hopelessness. “Eat! You have to eat, don’t you understand? You have to eat now, otherwise you’ll die!”\nAdvertisement\nThen Greta has her first panic attack. She makes a sound we’ve never heard before, ever. She lets out an abysmal howl that lasts for over 40 minutes. We haven’t heard her scream since she was an infant.\nI cradle her in my arms, and Moses lies alongside her, his moist nose pressed to her head. Greta asks, “Am I going to get well again?”\n“Of course you are,” I reply.\n“When am I going to get well?”\n“I don’t know. Soon.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nMalena Ernman and Svante Thunberg with their daughters, newborn Beata and Greta aged three, 2005. Photograph: Lizzie Larsson/TT/PA Images\nO\nn a white sheet of paper fixed to the wall we note down everything Greta eats and how long it takes for her to eat it. The amounts are small. And it takes a long time. But the emergency unit at the Stockholm Centre for Eating Disorders says that this method has a good long-term success rate. You write down what you eat meal by meal, then you list everything you can eat, things you wish you could eat and things you want to be able to eat further down the line.\nIt’s a short list. Rice, avocados and gnocchi.\nSchool starts in five minutes. But there isn’t going to be any school today. There isn’t going to be any school at all this week. Yesterday Svante and I got another email from the school expressing their “concern” about Greta’s lack of attendance, despite the fact that they were in possession of several letters from both doctors and psychologists explaining her situation.\nAdvertisement\nAgain, I inform the school office of our situation and they reply with an email saying that they hope Greta will come to school as usual on Monday so “this problem” can be dealt with. But Greta won’t be in school on Monday. Because unless a sudden dramatic change occurs she’s going to be admitted to Sachsska children’s hospital next week.\nSvante is boiling gnocchi. It is extremely important that the consistency is perfect, otherwise it won’t be eaten. We set a specific number of gnocchi on her plate. It’s a delicate balancing act; if we offer too many our daughter won’t eat anything and if we offer too few she won’t get enough. Whatever she ingests is obviously too little, but every little bite counts and we can’t afford to waste a single one.\nThen Greta sits there sorting the gnocchi. She turns each one over, presses on them and then does it again. And again. After 20 minutes she starts eating. She licks and sucks and chews: tiny, tiny bites. It takes for ever.\n“I’m full,” she says suddenly. “I can’t eat any more.”\nSvante and I avoid looking at each other. We have to hold back our frustration, because we’ve started to realise that this is the only thing that works. We’ve explored all other tactics. Every other conceivable way. We’ve ordered her sternly. We’ve screamed, laughed, threatened, begged, pleaded, cried and offered every imaginable bribe. But this seems to be what works the best.\nShe devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents\nSvante goes up to the sheet of paper on the wall and writes:\nLunch: 5 gnocchi. Time: 2 hours and 10 minutes.\nNot eating can mean many things. The question is what. The question is why. Svante and I look for answers. I spend the evenings reading everything I can find on the internet about anorexia and eating disorders. We’re sure it’s not anorexia. But, we keep hearing that anorexia is a very cunning disorder and will do anything to evade discovery. So we keep that door wide open.\nI speak endlessly to the children’s psychiatry service (BUP), the healthcare information service, doctors, psychologists and every conceivable acquaintance who may be able to offer the least bit of knowledge or guidance.\nAt Greta’s school there’s a psychologist who is experienced with autism. She talks with both of us on the phone and says that a careful investigation must still be conducted, but in her eyes – and off the record – Greta shows clear signs of being on the autism spectrum. “High-functioning Asperger’s,” she says.\nAdvertisement\nMeeting after meeting follows where we repeat our story and explore our options. We talk away while Greta sits silently. She has stopped speaking with anyone except me, Svante and Beata. Everyone really wants to offer all the help they can but it’s as if there’s no help to be had. Not yet, at least. We’re fumbling in the dark.\nAfter two months of not eating Greta has lost almost 10kg, which is a lot when you are rather small to begin with. Her body temperature is low and her pulse and blood pressure clearly indicate signs of starvation. She no longer has the energy to take the stairs and her scores on the depression tests she takes are sky high. We explain to our daughter that we have to start preparing ourselves for a stay at the hospital, where it’s possible to get nutrition and food without eating, with tubes and drips.\nIn mid-November there’s a big meeting at BUP. Greta sits silently. As usual. I’m crying. As usual. “If there are no developments after the weekend then we’ll have to admit you to the hospital,” the doctor says.\nOn the stairs down to the lobby Greta turns round. “I want to start eating again.” All three of us burst into tears and we go home and Greta eats a whole green apple. But nothing more will go down. As it turns out, it’s a little harder than you think to just start eating again. We take a few careful, trial steps and it works. We inch forward. She eats tiny amounts of rice, avocado and bananas. We take our time. And we start on sertraline, an antidepressant.\n“Do they always look at you that way?”\n“Don’t know. Think so.”\nSvante and Greta have been at the end-of-term ceremony at school where they tried to make themselves invisible in the corridors and stairwells. When students openly point and laugh at you – even though you’re walking alongside your parent – then things have gone too far. Way too far.\nAt home in the kitchen, Svante explains to me what they’ve just experienced while Greta eats her rice and avocado. I get so angry at what I hear that I could tear down half the street we live on with my bare hands, but our daughter has a different reaction. She’s happy it’s in the open.\nShe devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents. It’s like a movie montage featuring every imaginable bullying scenario. Stories about being pushed over in the playground, wrestled to the ground, or lured into strange places, the systematic shunning and the safe space in the girls’ toilets where she sometimes manages to hide and cry before the break monitors force her out into the playground again. For a full year, the stories keep coming. Svante and I inform the school, but the school isn’t sympathetic. Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks; several children have said repeatedly that Greta has behaved strangely and spoken too softly and never says hello. The latter they write in an email.\nAdvertisement\nThey write worse things than that, which is lucky for us, because when we report the school to the Swedish schools inspectorate we’re on a firm footing and there’s no doubt that the inspectorate will rule in our favour.\nI explain to Greta that she’ll have friends again, later. But her response is always the same. “I don’t want to have a friend. Friends are children and all children are mean.”\nG\nreta’s pulse rate gets stronger and finally the weight curve turns upwards strongly enough for a neuropsychiatric investigation to begin. Our daughter has Asperger’s, high-functioning autism and OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder. “We could formally diagnose her with selective mutism, too, but that often goes away on its own with time,” the doctor tells us. We aren’t surprised. Basically, this was the conclusion we drew several months ago.\nOn the way out, Beata calls to tell us she’s having dinner with a friend, and I feel a sting of guilt. Soon we’ll take care of you too, darling, I promise her in my mind, but first Greta has to get well.\nSummer is coming, and we walk the whole way home. We almost don’t even need to ration the burning of calories any more.\nSix months after Greta received her diagnosis, life has levelled out into something that resembles an everyday routine. She has started at a new school. I’ve cleared my calendar and put work on the back burner. But while we’re full up with taking care of Greta, Beata’s having more and more of a tough time. In school everything is ticking along. But at home she falls apart, crashes. She can’t stand being with us at all any more. Everything Svante and I do upsets her and in our company she can lose control. She is clearly is not feeling well.\nOne day near her 11th birthday I find her standing in the living room, hurling DVDs from the bookshelf down the spiral staircase to the kitchen. “You only care about Greta. Never about me. I hate you, Mum. You are the worst bloody mother in the whole world, you bloody fucking bitch,” she screams as Jasper the Penguin hits me on the forehead.\nIt’s autumn 2015 when Beata undergoes an evaluation for various neurodevelopmental disorders. She is diagnosed with ADHD, with elements of Asperger’s, OCD and ODD [oppositional defiant disorder]. Now that she has the diagnosis it feels like a fresh start for her, an explanation, a redress, a remedy. At school she has marvellous teachers who make everything work. She doesn’t have to do homework. We drop all activities. We avoid anything that may be stressful. And it works. Whatever happens we must never meet anger with anger, because that, pretty much always, does more harm than good. We adapt and we plan, with rigorous routines and rituals. Hour by hour. We try to find habits that work.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nOutside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, August 2018. Photograph: Anders Hellberg\nAdvertisement\nT\nhe fact that our children finally got help was due to a great many factors. In part it was about existing care, proven methods, advice and medication. It was also thanks to our own toil, patience, time and luck that Greta and Beata found their way back on their feet. However, what happened to Greta in particular can’t be explained simply by a psychiatric label. In the end, she simply couldn’t reconcile the contradictions of modern life. Things simply didn’t add up. We, who live in an age of historic abundance, who have access to huge shared resources, can’t afford to help vulnerable people in flight from war and terror – people like you and me, but who have lost everything.\nIn school one day, Greta’s class watches a film about how much rubbish there is in the oceans. An island of plastic, larger than Mexico, is floating around in the South Pacific. Greta cries throughout the film. Her classmates are also clearly moved. Before the lesson is over the teacher announces that on Monday there will be a substitute teaching the class, because she’s going to a wedding over the weekend, in Connecticut, right outside of New York. “Wow, lucky you,” the pupils say. Out in the corridor the trash island off the coast of Chile is already forgotten. New iPhones are taken out of fur-trimmed down jackets, and everyone who has been to New York talks about how great it is, with all those shops, and Barcelona has amazing shopping too, and in Thailand everything is so cheap, and someone is going with her mother to Vietnam over the Easter break, and Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen.\nShe saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye. The invisible, colourless, scentless, soundless abyss that our generation has chosen to ignore. She saw all of it – not literally, of course, but nonetheless she saw the greenhouse gases streaming out of our chimneys, wafting upwards with the winds and transforming the atmosphere into a gigantic, invisible garbage dump.\nShe was the child, we were the emperor. And we were all naked.\n‘Y\nou celebrities are basically to the environment what anti immigrant politicians are to multicultural society,” Greta says at the breakfast table early in 2016. I guess it’s true. Not just of celebrities, but of the vast majority of people. Everyone wants to be successful, and nothing conveys success and prosperity better than luxury, abundance and travel, travel, travel.\nGreta scrolls through my Instagram feed. She’s angry. “Name a single celebrity who’s standing up for the climate! Name a single celebrity who is prepared to sacrifice the luxury of flying around the world!”\nI was a part of the problem myself. Only recently I had been posting sun-drenched selfies from Japan. One “Good morning from Tokyo” and tens of thousands of “likes” rolled in to my brand-new iPhone. Something started to ache inside of me. Something I’d previously called travel anxiety or fear of flying but which was now taking on another, clearer form. On 6 March 2016 I flew home from a concert in Vienna, and not long after that I decided to stay on the ground for good.\nAdvertisement\nA few months later we walked home from the airport shuttle having met Svante and Beata off a flight from Rome.“You just released 2.7 tonnes of CO2,” Greta says to Svante. “And that corresponds to the annual emissions of five people in Senegal.” “I hear what you’re saying,” Svante says, nodding. “I’ll try to stay on the ground from now on, too.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFridays For Future climate change protest, Stockholm, November 2018. Photograph: IBL/Shutterstock\nG\nreta started planning her school strike over the summer of 2018. Svante has promised to take her to a building supplier’s to buy a scrap piece of wood that she can paint white and make a sign out of. “School Strike for the Climate”, it will say. And although more than anything we want her to drop the whole idea of going on strike from school – we support her. Because we see that she feels good as she draws up her plans – better than she has felt in many years. Better than ever before, in fact.\nOn the morning of 20 August 2018, Greta gets up an hour earlier than on a regular school day. She has her breakfast. Fills a backpack with schoolbooks, a lunchbox, utensils, a water bottle, a cushion and an extra sweater. She has printed out 100 flyers with facts and source references about the climate and sustainability crisis.\nShe walks her white bicycle out of the garage and rolls off to parliament. Svante cycles a few metres behind her, with her home-made sign under his right arm The weather is rather lovely. The sun is rising behind the old town and there is little chance of rain. The cycle paths and pavements are filled with people on their way to work and school.\nOutside the prime minister’s office, Greta stops and gets off her bicycle. Svante helps her take a picture before they lock the bicycles. Then she nods an almost invisible goodbye to Dad and, with the sign in her arms, staggers around the corner towards the government block where she stops and leans the sign against the greyish-red granite wall. Sets out her flyers. Settles down.\nAdvertisement\nShe asks a passerby to take another picture with her phone and posts both pictures on social media. After a few minutes the first sharing on Twitter starts. The political scientist Staffan Lindberg retweets her post. Then come another two retweets. And a few more. The meteorologist Pär Holmgren. The singer-songwriter Stefan Sundström. After that, it accelerates. She has fewer than 20 followers on Instagram and not many more on Twitter. But that’s already changing.\nNow there is no way back.\nA documentary film crew shows up. Svante calls and tells her that the newspaper Dagens ETC has been in touch with him and are on their way. Right after that [another daily newspaper] Aftonbladet shows up and Greta is surprised that everything is moving so fast. Happy and surprised. She wasn’t expecting this.\nIvan and Fanny from Greenpeace show up and ask Greta if everything is OK. “Can we help with anything?” they ask. “Do you have a police permit?” Ivan asks. She doesn’t. She didn’t think a permit would be needed. But evidently it is. “I can help you,” Ivan says.\nGreenpeace is far from alone in offering its support. Everyone wants to do their utmost to help out. But Greta doesn’t need any help. She manages all by herself. She is interviewed by one newspaper after the next. The simple fact that she is talking to strangers without feeling unwell is an unexpected joy for us parents. Everything else is a bonus.\nThe first haters start to attack, and Greta is openly mocked on social media. She is mocked by anonymous troll accounts, by rightwing extremists. And she is mocked by members of parliament. But that’s no surprise.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGreta’s Christmas 2018 Instagram post: ‘Happy holidays from me and my family!’ Photograph: Courtesy Greta Thunberg via instagram\nAdvertisement\nSvante stops by to make sure that everything is OK. He does this a couple of times every day. Greta stands by the wall and there are a dozen people around her. She looks stressed. The journalist from [newspaper] Dagens Nyheter asks whether it’s OK if they film an interview, and Svante sees out of the corner of his eye that something is wrong. “Wait, let me check,” he says, and takes Greta behind a pillar under the arch. Her whole body is tense. She is breathing heavily, and Svante says that there’s nothing to worry about. “Let’s go home now,” he says. “OK?” Greta shakes her head. She’s crying.\n“You don’t need to do any of this. Let’s forget about this and get out of here.” But Greta doesn’t want to go home. She stands perfectly still for a few seconds. Breathes. Then she walks around in a little circle and somehow pushes away all that panic and fear that she has been carrying inside her for as long as she can remember. After that she stops, and stares straight ahead. Her breathing is still agitated and tears are running down her cheeks. “No,” she says. “I’m doing this.”\nWe monitor how Greta is feeling as closely as we can. But we can’t see any signs that she’s feeling anything but good. She sets the alarm clock for 6.15am and she’s happy when she gets out of bed. She’s happy as she cycles off to parliament, and she’s happy when she comes home in the afternoon. During the afternoons she catches up on schoolwork and checks social media. She goes to bed on time, falls asleep right away and sleeps peacefully the whole night long. Eating, on the other hand, is not going well.\n“There are too many people and I don’t have time. Everyone wants to talk all the time.”\n“You have to eat,” Svante says. Greta doesn’t say anything. Food is a sensitive topic. The most difficult one. But on the third day something else happens. Ivan from Greenpeace stops by again. He’s holding a white plastic bag. “Are you hungry, Greta? It’s noodles. Thai,” he says. “Vegan. Would you like some?”\nHe holds out the bag and Greta leans forward and reaches for the food container. She opens the lid and smells it a few times. Then she takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? Why would it be remarkable for a child to be sitting with a bunch of people eating vegan pad thai? Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving.\nPlay Video\n2:06\nGreta Thunberg: the speeches that helped spark a climate movement – video\nAdvertisement\nGreta’s energy is exploding. There doesn’t seem to be any outer limit, and even if we try to hold her back she just keeps going. By herself.\nBeata sits with Greta one day in front of parliament. But this is Greta’s thing. Not hers. The sudden fuss over her big sister is not easy to handle. Beata sees that Greta suddenly has 10,000 followers on Instagram, and we all think that’s crazy. But Beata handles it well. Even when her own feed is filled with comments about Greta, and can you tell her this and that. All everyone suddenly cares about is Greta, Greta and Greta. “It’s nuts,” Beata says one afternoon after school. “It’s exactly like Beyoncé and Jay-Z,” she states, with an acerbic emphasis. “Greta is Beyoncé. And I’m Jay-Z.”\nWe get death threats on social media, excrement through the letter box, and social services report that they have received a great number of complaints against us as Greta’s parents. But at the same time they state in the letter that they “do NOT intend to take any action”. We think of the capital letters as a little love note from an anonymous official. And it warms us.\nMore and more people are keeping Greta company in front of parliament. Children, adults, teachers, retirees. One day an entire class of elementary-school pupils stops and wants to talk, and Greta has to walk away for a bit. Feels mild panic. She steps aside and starts crying. She can’t help it. But after a while she calms herself down and goes back and greets the children. Afterwards she explains that she has a hard time associating with children sometimes because she has had such bad experiences. “I’ve never met a group of children that hasn’t been mean to me. And wherever I’ve been I’ve been bullied because I’m different.”\nSeveral times a day people come up and say that they have stopped flying, parked the car or become vegans thanks to her. To be able to influence so many people in such a short time is bewildering in a good way. The phenomenon keeps growing. Faster and faster by the hour. In the run-up to the end of the strike, Greta is being followed by TV crews from the BBC, German ARD and Danish TV2.\nAltogether 1,000 children and adults sit with Greta on the last day of the school strike. And media from several different countries report live from Mynttorget Square. She has succeeded. Some say that she alone has done more for the climate than politicians and the mass media have in years. But Greta doesn’t agree. “Nothing has changed,” she says. “The emissions continue to increase and there is no change in sight.”\nAt three o’clock Svante comes and picks her up and they walk together over to the bicycles outside Rosenbad.\n“Are you satisfied?” Svante asks.\n“No,” she says, with her gaze fixed on the bridge back towards the old town. “I’m going to continue.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg leads a Fridays For Future rally in Turin, December 2019. Photograph: Alessandro Di Marco/EPA\nAdvertisement\nT\nhe next day is Saturday 8 September. It’s the day before the Swedish parliamentary elections and Greta is going to speak at the People’s Climate March in Stockholm. She has only given one speech before at a small event. Prior to that she’d never spoken in front of more people than fit in a classroom, and on those few occasions she had not exactly seemed at ease.\nThere are a lot of people in the park for the march and the rally. Almost 2,000 have crowded together at the stage and more are on their way. Somehow there’s a different feeling about this protest. It doesn’t feel the same as usual. It feels as if something might happen. Soon. It’s no longer just the familiar faces. The regulars. The activists. The Greenpeace volunteers in polar-bear suits. Here, suddenly, are all conceivable kinds of people and characters. People who might have all sorts of jobs. “This is my first demonstration,” states a well-dressed man in his 40s. “Mine too,” a woman next to him says, with a laugh.\nThe host introduces Greta and she walks slowly but steadily into the middle of the stage. The audience cheers. Svante, on the other hand, is scared out of his wits. What will happen now? Will she start crying? Is she going to run away? He feels like an awful parent for not putting his foot down and saying “No” from the start. All this is starting to feel too big and unreal.\nBut Greta is as calm as can be. She takes the speech out of her pocket and looks out over the sea of people. Then she grasps the microphone and starts speaking. “Hi, my name is Greta,” she says in Swedish. “I am going to speak in English now. And I want you to take out your phones and film what I’m saying. Then you can post it on your social media.”\n“My name is Greta Thunberg and I am 15 years old. And I have schoolstriked for the climate for the last three weeks. Yesterday was the last day. But…” She pauses. “We will go on with the school strike. Every Friday, as from now, we will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris agreement.” The crowd cheers.\nGreta continues. “I urge all of you to do the same. Sit outside your parliament or local government, wherever you are, until your country is on a safe pathway to a below-two-degree warming target. Time is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster.”\nHer voice is steady and there are no signs of nervousness. She appears to be at ease up there. She even smiles sometimes.\n“The changes required are enormous and we must all contribute in every part of our everyday life. Especially us in the rich countries, where no nation is doing nearly enough.”\nThe audience stands up. Shouting, applauding. The ovation doesn’t stop. And Greta is smiling the most beautiful smile I have ever seen her smile. I’m watching everything from a live stream on my phone in the hallway outside the dressing rooms at the Oscarsteatern. The tears keep coming.\n• This is an edited extract from Our House Is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis by Malena and Beata Ernman, Greta and Svante Thunberg, published by Penguin on 5 March (£16.99).

Each year about 2 million tonnes is dug up, dropped on to an overland conveyor and sent to the Eraring power plant next door to be burned.\nAlthough the New South Wales mine isn’t new, its operation under owner Centennial Coal has changed over the past couple of years, leading to a dramatic increase in greenhouse gas escaping its coal seams.\nEmissions at the mine in 2017-18 were 65% above the government-agreed limit for the site. New data published just before Christmas show Centennial was also in breach last financial year, with carbon pollution at Myuna 47% above its limit.\nIn an era in which political battles are fought over how to meet climate targets, an emissions rise of this proportion – nearly half a million tonnes at one site over just a couple of years – is noteworthy. Along with similar examples at other industrial sites, including those owned by BHP, Chevron and a range of other fossil-fuel companies, it helps explain why official data says the Morrison government will fail to cut emissions to 5% below 2000 levels in 2020 as it claims.\nThe government's sudden passion for climate technology is newfound and insincere\nSimon Holmes à Court\nRead more\nIt was not supposed to be this way. Among the issues on the agenda for the Morrison government this year as it considers where to head on climate policy is whether this trend in industrial emissions can continue.\nHow did we get here?\nBack in 2015 when Tony Abbott was still prime minister, the Coalition released details of what it called a “safeguard mechanism”, a policy it said would deal with the problem of rising pollution from big industry. Greg Hunt, the environment minister who designed the policy, told ABC Radio National it would put “a limit on the emissions that individual firms can have”.\nSpecifically, it would set a limit – a baseline – for about 140 industrial facilities that emitted more than 100,000 tonnes each year. While the government chose not to emphasise the point, companies that breached their baseline at a particular site without federal approval would have to pay by buying carbon credits created through cuts elsewhere.\nAs Hunt described it, the safeguard mechanism was half the Coalition’s direct action climate policy (a name long since dropped). The first half of direct action was the emissions reduction fund, a $2.5bn incentive scheme under which the government would pay for pollution cuts, mostly from landowners who signed up to plant or look after native vegetation. The second half would “safeguard” those cuts – ensure they were not just wiped out – by preventing “significant increases in emissions above business-as-usual levels” elsewhere.\nIn practice, the scheme has run quite differently.\nIn the case of Centennial Coal, the Australian Conservation Foundation found it could reasonably have been expected to pay more than $6m to offset its extra emissions, based on the price the government pays for carbon credits. Instead it followed rules set up by the government that allowed it to retrospectively apply for a change to its baseline arrangements.\nMost people paying attention to the scheme have been left to wonder: why have a policy to limit emissions that routinely allows companies to ignore their limit?\nSuzanne Harter, a climate campaigner with the ACF, is among those who says it makes no sense. “If the government keeps increasing the pollution baselines, there is no point to the safeguard mechanism,” she says.\nLabor to announce net zero emissions target by 2050 and will oppose taxpayer funding of new coal power\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nTennant Reed, who runs climate, energy and environment policy for the Australian Industry Group, which represents the interests of more than 60,000 businesses, agrees. “If it never has to do something to actually reduce emissions it will have been a waste of time for everyone involved,” he says.\nThe numbers tell a pretty basic story. In the first two years of the scheme, analysts at energy and carbon consultancy RepuTex found the regulator had approved changes that allowed big industry to emit up to 32% more without penalty than when the safeguard was introduced.\nCompanies used only some of this additional headroom. Actual emissions under the scheme rose 12% over those two years.\nBased on this, RepuTex found the safeguard was likely to lead to an extra 280m tonnes of pollution over the next decade, more than six months’ worth of Australia’s total carbon pollution. It would more than eclipse the 193m tonnes of cuts contracted under the emissions reduction fund.\nRepuTex’s executive director, Hugh Grossman, said it meant taxpayers’ dollars spent on storing carbon dioxide in vegetation was “effectively money going down the drain”.\nThe rise in emissions under the safeguard mechanism reflects a longer-term trend. In a separate report, RepuTex found industrial emissions had risen 60% since 2005, the year against which the government has pledged at least a 26% cut by 2030.\nThe surge has been driven by the creation of a $50bn liquefied natural gas export industry across northern Australia and increases in direct combustion at mining sites, venting of fugitive emissions in fossil fuel extraction and pollution from metals, chemicals and minerals processing.\nThe rise in industrial emissions is the primary reason national emissions have stubbornly refused to fall while there has been a historic drop in pollution from power plants and a significant dip from farming due to the drought.\nThat could start to change this year as more of the recent record investment in solar and wind power, spurred by the now-reached national renewable energy target, is comes online. But analysts say Australia cannot hope to meet its climate targets while major industry is left unchecked. The industrial sector is expected to pass power generation to become the country’s most polluting sector within two or three years.\nIs disunity in politics really death any more? I'm not so sure given the rolling climate conflict\nKatharine Murphy\nRead more\nA key question for the government is whether it intends to address this as it considers new climate policies this year. One option likely to be before it will be a recommendation in a review of its climate policies led by the businessman Grant King, that quietly submitted its report earlier this month. In a discussion paper sent to some interest groups late last year, King’s panel floated changing the safeguard mechanism so companies that emit less than their baseline would be rewarded with carbon credits they could sell to the government or business.\nAdvertisement\nThe scheme was clearly was designed with that in mind. In 2015 Hunt said it would be used to cut emissions by 200m tonnes over the decade to 2030. It implied limits would be enforced and tightened so companies had to either reduce pollution over time or trade in carbon credits to offset it. In other words, a return to a form of carbon pricing.\nThat idea was dropped before the last election - the safeguard mechanism was not included among policies that would be used to meet Australia’s commitments under the Paris climate agreement. The current minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, says the mechanism is “designed to support growth while encouraging businesses to lower their emissions intensity”.\nThe shift proposed by King in last year’s discussion paper would come with challenges – for example, working out how to guarantee that businesses were rewarded for changes in practice that cut pollution, and not for things over which they had no control, such as a downturn in the economy.\nIt would also require the government to commit to forcing industry to reduce pollution over time, a shift seemingly at odds with Morrison’s “technology over taxation” mantra.\nBut the shift could have the support of the Australian Industry Group, which backs turning the safeguard mechanism into a meaningful emissions policy as long as it includes protection for export industries so they are not disadvantaged against overseas competitors.\nReed says if there is an intention to reduce industrial emissions, ratcheting down baselines under the safeguard mechanism is an obvious option. “That would be a substantial step, and a substantial change,” he says. “The safeguard mechanism could be part of how we get there, but right now it’s not doing much other than creating paperwork for industry and the government.”\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nThe government has already begun to make changes to the safeguard that would allow that sort of shift. When the scheme began, emissions baselines were initially based on either a facility’s historic emissions or an independent forecast of future pollution.\nUnder changes being introduced this year, all facilities will be moved to limits based not on their total emissions, but on emissions intensity – how much they emit each unit of production. In one sense this just locks in what is already happening in cases such as the Myuna colliery – if companies lift production they will be able to put out more carbon pollution without risking a penalty.\nBut emissions intensity baselines could also be more obviously reduced over time to drive a shift to cleaner practice without putting pressure on production levels. This is part of what Labor proposed to do – without releasing much detail – when it said before last year’s election it would cut emissions under the safeguard by 45% by 2030.\nAdvertisement\nErwin Jackson, policy director with the Investor Group on Climate Change, believes the government can delay action on industrial emissions for only so long. The longer it waits, the greater the risk of a more “dramatic and draconian” shift as the pressure to act – from investors, from other countries, from the planet – escalates.\nHe says the Australian climate debate remains stuck on the idea that pumping emissions into the atmosphere does not have a cost that will be borne eventually, one way or the other. “To address climate change you have to reduce emissions, and someone has to pay for that. Investors are already pricing this risk,” he says. “The longer we delay action the higher the cost will be.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This is a massive step for our economy.\nLast year Australia expelled 532m tonnes of greenhouse gasses. Aiming to get to zero net in 30 years is not something you can dismiss as a sign of a party doing nothing.\nBushfires highlight need for urgent climate action and 'a real target', Anthony Albanese says\nRead more\nThe government is currently refusing to set any target. Instead, the prime minister is talking up his “technology over taxation” approach.\nThere is a very easy way for the government to demonstrate it agrees with the science on climate change and is committed to reducing emissions – set a target to reduce emissions that agrees with the science.\nThe IPCC made this pretty clear for governments in its “summary for policymakers” report released in October 2018.\nIt stated that to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, “human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ around 2050”.\nWe should pause here and note that within six months of this very clear statement, the Coalition went to the election with a target of a 26% cut from 2005 levels by 2030, while the ALP went with a target of a 45% cut.\nAnd of course the focus of the debate from most of the media was on the cost of the 45% cut rather than why the Coalition was ignoring the science.\nA damning moment for our media.\nBoris Johnson of all people has committed to zero net emissions by 2050, but our government will not, cowed as it is by people such as senator Matt Canavan who tweeted this week: “There is a simple reason that Labor won’t cost its net zero emissions policy because net zero emissions = net zero jobs!”\nAs the Australian Institute’s Matt Grudnoff noted, “net zero jobs” actually means any jobs lost will be balanced by job gains, which is perhaps not what Canavan is trying to argue.\nThis brings me to the second point – this is not an astonishing target. It is in effect just what the ALP was already planning.\nGetting to zero net emissions by 2050 goes along the same path as aiming for a 45% cut by 2030, as we can see in the graph.\nI say this not to discount the policy, but to highlight that given it is in line with what the ALP was already targeting and also is what a conservative government in the UK is planning, the big issue is not that the ALP has this target, but that the government does not.\nIt is based on the science and it also will greatly benefit our economy.\nPutting the 'net' into net zero targets: it’s time to start doing things that work. Now\nRichard Denniss\nRead more\nI have written in the past that getting to zero net zero emissions is going to be tough. If it was easy it would have been done already, so let us not lie and say it can be done with no pain.\nIt will require a huge change in our economy. But the good news is it will hugely benefit our economy and nation.\nThe CSIRO has estimated that if we continue on our current path, our GDP out to 2060 will grow by just 2.1% annually; but if we target zero net emissions by 2050, our economy will be so transformed and improved that our GDP will grow on average each year by 2.75% and real wages will be greatly improved.\nDoing nothing is not the answer – it is economic degradation.\nWe must get to zero net emissions by at least 2050, and the ALP target – which will need strong interim targets as well – must be the baseline from which all climate-change policy debate occurs.\nAdvertisement\n• Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

By the slimmest of majorities, voters defied the status quo, and the party that did the best job convincing the public it would honour their will collected the political rewards.\nThe dynamic unleashed by the 2013 plebiscite on buying the local utility grids back from private providers helps to explain why the city state is expected to buck national trends at this Sunday’s elections.\nPolls predict the ruling centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are in decline across Germany, will hang on to their Hamburg stronghold with relative ease. Their junior coalition partner, the Green party, is expected to increase its share of the vote, leading to a strengthened mandate for the current power-sharing deal.\nAdvertisement\nThe CDU of Angela Merkel is likely to drop into third place while the far-right Alternative für Deutschland may even struggle to make it above the 5% threshold for entry into the Hamburg parliament.\nYet a centre-left success in the city state is more likely to be the result of local factors than national trends.\nIn September 2013, 51% of the electorate voted to “re-municipalise” the local electricity and district heating networks, as proposed by grassroots initiative “Our Hamburg Our Grid”. And while the energy debate has only played a minor role in this year’s election campaign, it has increased the profile of the two governing parties.\nFor one, Hamburg has managed to get de-privatisation done. In Berlin, by contrast, the senate announced its intention to buy back the district heating grid but has so far failed to drive the project through the courts. Hamburg sealed a €650m (£545m) deal last September.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nFor Hamburg’s SPD – which campaigned against re-municipalisation, and is widely seen as more pro-business than elsewhere in the country – the buy-back has helped show it can also apply its famed pragmatism to more traditionally leftwing projects.\nThe local party has been quicker to discover its green heart than other SPD branches in the country. And on Thursday, Hamburg’s SPD mayor, Peter Tschentscher, surprised his Green coalition partners by proposing to shut one coal unit at the city’s Moorburg power plant and convert the second to gas, in addition building a 100MW electrolyser to produce green hydrogen at the site.\n“If we hadn’t listened to voters, we would have been punished,” said Matthias Ederhof, an SPD candidate on the regional party list. “We are on the up because voters see us as competent.”\nThe re-municipalised electricity grid, for which Hamburg paid the Swedish energy group Vattenfall €610m, has been making the city senate a healthy profit since 2017.\nThe Greens are finding that having utility grids in public hands allows them to propose initiatives that would otherwise have sounded like pipe dreams. Hamburg, a city whose wealth has historically grown around its inland port, has in recent years turned into a busy laboratory for renewable energy schemes.\nHamburg is now the first state in Germany to write a legally binding date into its constitution, the year 2030, not just for halving its carbon emissions from 1990 levels, but also for phasing out coal power for district heating altogether. The 250,000 households in the city which use district heating are still powered by coal stations in Wedel and Tiefstack.\nIn the future, the Greens propose, Hamburg homes will be heated entirely from renewable sources such as waste incineration, biomass or solar power. There is a proposal to build a large heat storage system underneath the harbour, capturing excess heat produced in the summer for use during the winter by pumping hot salt water hundreds of meters deep into the soil.\nEven an old air raid bunker in the Wilhelmsburg district has been transformed into a so-called “energy bunker”, with a large heat reservoir. The city has the highest number of charging points for electric cars in Germany, more than Berlin or Munich.\nIf Hamburg’s utility grid was still owned by Vattenfall, such experiments would have been unthinkable, said Christian Maass, a former state secretary for the environment and urban planning.\n“Private monopolies become a problem especially when the state doesn’t have the power and capacity to regulate them. In Hamburg, it therefore made more sense for the senate to hold the monopoly, because politicians can be held to account much more effectively than private companies,” said Maass, who now works as consultant on renewable energy.\n“Expectations on state-owned energy or heating grids are much more long-term and less orientated around maximising profit. If you want to shape the future of a city, that’s an immeasurable advantage.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Big snow dumps are less common now. Much of this change can be blamed on anthropogenic global warming, but it turns out that Europe’s efforts to clean its skies have also reduced the likelihood of harsh winter weather.\nAir pollution can have a significant impact on our climate. Some pollutants, like sulphate particles, scatter radiation and cause cooling. Air pollution can also change cloud properties. Since the 1970s countries across Europe and North America have significantly curbed their air pollution, resulting in more of the sun’s energy reaching Earth’s surface over these locations.\nYuan Wang, from the California Institute of Technology, and colleagues have input air pollution data (gathered between 1970 and 2005) into climate models to investigate how cleaner skies may have impacted atmospheric circulation patterns and extreme weather. Their results, published in Nature Climate Change, reveal that the reduction in air pollution has altered the strength and location of high altitude winds, shifting the jet stream further to the north during winter. This change has suppressed cold extremes over northern Eurasia. Future pollution reduction over China is expected to exert a similar influence.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The algae that provides food and the coral’s colour separate from the animal, leaving behind a visible white skeleton.\nSevere bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. Extreme heat can also kill corals almost immediately.\nSkirving’s analysis identified a key period from 26 February to 4 March when widespread bleaching was likely to hit.\nDuring this time, tides would be weak, meaning there was less mixing of the waters that help dissipate heat through the water column. At the same time, the unusually high ocean temperatures would remain.\nHe said: “We will see temperatures rocket through through that period. But if it does get really bad is yet to be seen – it depends on rain and wind – and neither of those can be precisely predicted.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA 20 February update on heat stress conditions from the Great barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.\nHis analysis said only a significant weather event “such as a cyclone” during that eight-day period would save the reef from widespread bleaching.\nThe world’s oceans have taken up about 93% of the extra energy caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to the UN’s climate science panel.\nAccording to the panel, it had high confidence that tropical coral reefs “are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C [of global warming], with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.”\nProf Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a marine biologist at the University of Queensland, whose early work helped to explain the link between coral bleaching and climate change, said in the past two weeks, “the risk factors for major bleaching events, like elevated water temperatures” had “increased dramatically”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nSkirving said it appeared large-scale bleaching events were happening more frequently on the reef, and listed 1983, 1987, 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and “now likely 2020”.\nWhile reefs could “bounce back” from bleaching events, there was concern individual reefs would not have enough time to recover between each outbreak.\nDr Lyle Vail, director of the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station, said on Friday there was already bleaching on some corals there.\n“Alarm bells are ringing, we’re in troubled waters,” he said.\nLizard Island was badly hit by bleaching in 2016. Vail added: “The coral recovery was coming along nicely so it’s hard to see it bleaching again, fingers crossed for some cloud cover and rain to cool things down.”\nSeveral scientists working at Heron Island and the nearby One Tree Island have also been sharing images of corals beginning to bleach.\nDr Tracy Ainsworth, a coral biologist at UNSW, has been with a team of scientists at a research station on Heron Island since 15 January.\n“We have been recording bleaching in the lagoon and reef flat and some exposed areas of the reef, and that’s concerning. A lot of the reef is fine though in the wave-exposed areas.”\nCoulson\n(@Coulson_Lantz)\nI've been on Heron Island for a month measuring community calcification and production with our team @CoralTrace @BillLeggat1 @jesseb3rg @thedivinggoose.

The fact that prime minister Scott Morrison is pushing back hard against the calls for such a target sends yet another strong signal that his government still denies the need to tackle climate change.\nSensing it must be seen to do something, but committed to doing nothing substantive, the government is arguing that investing in technology is the superior pathway to… to… to what? Are billions of dollars of public funds about to be allocated to a strategy that delivers on an unspoken goal?\nThis passion for technology is newfound and insincere. In truth, our government has a long history of undermining climate technologies.\nOil and gas firms 'have had far worse climate impact than thought'\nRead more\nIn the three years to 2016, the government ripped just shy of $1bn from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), the body charged with helping early stage technologies through to commercial launch.\nThe funding of a feasibility study for a coal power station in Collinsville and the foreshadowed gift of $11m to extend the life of the 42 years old Vales Point coal power station in the Hunter, demonstrate just how reluctant the Coalition is to let go of last century’s energy technologies.\nOne of the most promising and critical new technologies is the rapid maturation of the electric vehicle, but who can forget the government’s pushback against EVs during last year’s election?\nLast November I visited the Leilac zero carbon cement project Belgium – an exciting project given that cement is responsible for 7% of global emissions, more than twice as much as aviation. The new process captures most of the carbon dioxide that’s ordinarily released to the atmosphere during cement manufacture. The technology, which can be powered by renewable energy, was developed in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria and was lured to Europe on the back of a €12 million grant and a price on carbon.\nIn the alternate universe where Arena and our carbon price weren’t smashed by ideological attacks, that world-changing technology would be proudly Australian made.\nWhile there’s plenty of valuable research and development in our future, especially for the difficult to decarbonise sectors of cement, steel and aviation, the truth is that we already have the technology to deal with around 70% of global emissions.\nThe pathway is simple – electrify everything and swap fossil fuels for renewables. These technologies have come down in cost not because of boffins in laboratory coats, but because of innovation born of sustained deployment and ruthless competition.\nMike and Annie Cannon-Brooke’s Resilient Energy Collective is a case study for how far we’ve come. In just a handful of weeks the group has put together an emergency power product for restoring power to bushfire affected communities.

Industry is champing at the bit to implement such a plan — they just need a minister who believes in the end goal and is committed to resolving the roadblocks.\nIn reality, the call for technology before action is a specious distraction designed to paper over the plan to take no action. The greatest proponent of the frame is Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg, one of a small cadre of almost respectable climate obfuscationists.\nIn the lead up to the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, Lomborg handpicked a panel of ancient Nobel laureates to rank 16 climate solutions. The four proposed carbon tax schemes were ranked dead last, and the top three projects deemed worthy of consideration were “marine cloud whitening”, energy research and development and “stratospheric aerosol insertion”.\nThe top-ranked solution would involve a global fleet of “1,900 unmanned ships spraying sea water mist into the air to thicken clouds” and reflect the sun’s rays back into space. The third solution involves fleets of planes spraying sulphur dioxide into the sky. The chemical would mimic the effects of volcanoes “reacting with water to form a hazy layer … spread around the globe … scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight”.\nAdvertisement\nThe first three years of the Coalition government focussed on tearing down climate policy. The next three used endless reviews that came to nothing – as intended.\nIn July 2014, Tony Abbott finally made good on his promise to dismantle Australia’s carbon price mechanism, our most effective and efficient climate policy. In doing so, not only did he throw away the best tool we had, he cheated Australian farmers out of earning billions from exporting carbon credits to Europe.\nIn 2015, Abbott managed to slash the renewable energy target – assisted in the background by Angus Taylor, the man now charged with reducing emissions – cutting future activity under the target by 40%.\nThe only half decent action has been the emissions reduction fund, called a fig leaf of a policy by the party’s once and future leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2009, whereby taxpayers, not polluters, buy carbon offsets. To date, the ERF has bought just 50m offsets, which doesn’t even cover the increase in emissions from just the LNG sector during the last 5 years.\nLabor to announce net zero emissions target by 2050 and will oppose taxpayer funding of new coal power\nRead more\nNow the government is talking about a “technology investment target”, whatever that means. Will we be subjected to another barrage of lies that some magical technology exists to cut coal emissions? Remember CCS and HELE? Hopefully by now we all now know that “clean coal” is as real as healthy cigarettes.\nIf Scott Morrison is genuine about climate action, then sure, he should start by restoring the billion dollars ripped out of Arena. In fact, let’s give them a few hundred million a year to help Australian ideas reach their potential and give us a whole new export sector to replace the inevitable decline in coal exports. We have the resources, people and smarts to position Australia for great success in a carbon-constrained global economy.\nAt this point, the roadblocks to effective and affordable action are social and political, not technological.\nSo here we are again. Another strategy to kick the can down the road. The Finkel review bought the government a year of doing nothing in 2017, as did the national energy guarantee in 2018. The hollow climate solutions package helped the government escape scrutiny in 2019, however the “Black Summer” and the approaching November’s COP26 conference in Glasgow – where countries are expected to lift their commitments in the direction of the Paris agreement’s goals – leave the government with nowhere to hide.\nSimon Holmes à Court is senior advisor to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University and sits on the board of the Smart Energy Council\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Decision-makers should think of these trends as waves, which, especially if they occur simultaneously, could feel like a tsunami for those who fail to adapt their thinking and practices in a timely manner.\nThe first and most important trend is climate change, which has evolved from a relatively distant concern, on which there is ample time to take remedial action, to an imminent and increasingly urgent threat.\nThe mobilisation of various concerned segments of society, owing partly to unusual climatic disruptions in recent years, has greatly increased the pressure on companies to act now. BP’s recent announcement that it intends to achieve “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050 – a notable promise by an energy company that operates in several highly challenging settings – is the latest example of business responding to such calls. It is only a matter of time until this pressure also prompts governments to take further steps, not only to encourage green activities but also to tax and regulate those that cause pollution.\nThe white swan harbingers of global economic crisis are already here\nNouriel Roubini\nRead more\nSecond, privacy concerns have grown alongside technical innovations involving artificial intelligence and big data.\nSociety is increasingly recognising that recent technological advances allow not only for more efficient compilation of huge amounts of personal data but also for using this information to monitor and alter behaviours. Broadly speaking, data is controlled and exploited either by governments (particularly in China), big tech companies (as in the US), or more by users (as in Europe). But none of these three general operating paradigms seems to provide sufficient comfort and assurance to most people.\nThe third secular force involves disruptions to the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation.\nThe initial trigger for this was the trade-policy pivot by the US president Donald Trump’s administration – from cooperative conflict resolution to explicit confrontation, from multilateralism to bilateralism (or even unilateralism) and from rule-based to more ad hoc arrangements – aimed at creating a still-free but fairer trading system. But de-globalisation has been turbocharged by the outbreak of the deadly Covid-19 virus, which has disrupted the flow of goods and services in China and beyond.\nThese challenges to globalisation have opened the door for governments to weaponise economic tools to meet objectives that transcend economics, such as national security. This, in turn, is calling into question conventional wisdom about cross-border supply chains, just-in-time inventory management and reliance on external demand to boost domestic growth.\nThe final trend is demographic and concerns more than the ageing of societies in Europe and Asia and this trend’s economic and political implications. It also goes beyond the growing realisation that millennials’ starkly different expectations – regarding professional careers, personal engagement, political action and the delivery of goods and services – will persist and deepen.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nFor starters, businesses need to be smarter about “anywhere, any place, any time” delivery. Furthermore, job loyalty and tenure are decreasing, while expectations of comprehensive job fulfilment and engagement are rising. Self-mobilisation for political and other causes, often with no visible leadership structure, has become a lot easier, yet often is less durable and raises tricky questions about what comes afterward. And all of this is taking place amid the continued migration of an ever-expanding range of interactions from physical to virtual spaces.\nEach of these secular forces will have an important impact on the effectiveness and success of companies and governments alike. And while being challenging overall, the four trends involve a diverse and geographically dispersed set of winners and losers. Executives and policymakers, therefore, must make timely revisions (including pre-emptive changes) not only to their business models and operational approaches but also to both their tactical and strategic mindsets.\nGetting this right will require cognitive diversity, openness to constructive criticism, repeated scenario analyses and multidisciplinary approaches. Moreover, because each of the secular forces involves a considerable degree of uncertainty (with lots of known unknowns, and probably more than a few unknown unknowns behind them), a combination of resilience, optionality and agility also is important. And this is even before one considers unanticipated periodic shocks such as the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe challenges to sound decision-making and leadership in business and government are not limited to mapping each of the four secular forces and the required adaptation. Decision-makers also must consider correlations and causalities between these trends that can make their total impact multiplicative rather than merely additive.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nAs a quick illustration, consider another aspect of demographic change: migration and the humanitarian challenges that often come with it. Climate change confronts countries with the possibility of waves of migratory human flows that they will find hard to accept and inhumane to refuse.\nThe combination of de-globalisation and the misuse of AI and big data to infringe individual privacy is similarly troubling. This could lead to questionable behaviour by some governments and encourage malicious non-state actors to disrupt societies and economies.\nThe world is in a period of accelerating change, the leading edge of which is the ever-growing list of developments that have gone from impossible to inevitable. Many (though by no means all) of the challenges facing business and political leaders may be broken down into four secular changes that can help anchor the timely formulation of required responses at the local, national, regional and global levels. The faster that companies and governments recognise this, the likelier they will be to alter the balance of benefits, costs and risks in their favour.\n• Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz.

There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry.\nEarlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago.\nFor a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample – made up of about a tonne of ice – was extracted with a Blue Ice Drill, capable of producing the world’s biggest ice cores.\nThe findings, published in Nature, suggest the share of naturally released fossil methane has been overestimated by “an order of magnitude”, which means that human activities are 25-40% more responsible for fossil methane in the atmosphere than thought.\nThis strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane – a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere.\nAn earlier study revealed methane emissions from US oil and gas plants were 60% higher than reported to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAccidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when scientists analysed satellite data provided by the European Space Agency.\nFracking also appears to have worsened the problem. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in fracking activity in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a “bridge fuel” because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction.\nQ&A\nWhat is Cop – and how will it help?\nShow\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent\nWas this helpful?\nGrowing calls for tighter controls will be strengthened by the new study. The lead author, Benjamin Hmiel, said the paper was cause for optimism because it showed that action on methane – which has a relatively short shelf life, persisting in the atmosphere for about nine years – could give a strong short-term boost to efforts to stabilise the climate.\n“Placing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,” Hmiel said. “Methane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it’s going to reflect more quickly.”\nOther scientists who were not involved in the research concurred there were positive implications in the findings, but only if governments were able to rein in fossil fuel companies, which has not been the case until now.\n“This indicates that the fossil fuel sector has a much more polluting impact beyond being responsible for the overwhelming majority of carbon dioxide emissions. This is worrying and overall bad news,” said Dr Joeri Rogelj, a climate change lecturer at the Grantham Institute.\nThe good news, Rogelj said, was that measures to prevent leaks, reduce flaring and switch to renewables would be more effective than expected. “What this study shows is that we can have a bigger impact on methane in the atmosphere than earlier thought. This allows us to set climate policy priorities right.”\nDave Reay, the executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation, said one of the key messages from the study was that the old bottom-up method of measuring methane emissions was “woefully inadequate”.\n“We knew fossil fuel extraction – including fracking – was a major part of global methane emissions, but this impressive study suggests it is a far bigger culprit in human-induced climate change than we had ever thought,” he said.\n“If correct, gas, coal and oil extraction and distribution around the world are responsible for almost half of all human-induced methane emissions. Add to that all the carbon dioxide that is then emitted when the fossil fuels are burned, and you need look no further for the seat of the climate emergency fire.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

People in flood-hit areas are grappling with a seemingly relentless onslaught of extreme weather conditions, and are making preparations for the future while having to deal with the present consequences.\n“I am lucky, only one room of my house was flooded, but some people have had to leave everything,” Amanda Gillender, a 71-year-old painter from Eardisland on the River Arrow in Herefordshire, told the Guardian.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFlooding in Eardisland. Photograph: Amanda Gillender\nThe scale of the flooding in Gillender’s village has been unprecedented and there are record levels of water in rivers nearby. She fears life there may become untenable if the climate crisis is not taken seriously. But for now, her most immediate concern is dealing with her insurance claim as she assesses the damage to her 500-year old cottage.\n“The worst thing about flooding is the waiting and watching as the water rises foot after foot deep,” she said. “There’s nothing you can do. Once it has happened you’re completely isolated because you can’t go out and are left alone with the painful, disruptive aftermath.”\nStorm Dennis: flood-hit communities brace for more heavy rain\nRead more\nElsewhere, the cumulative stress is having a grave impact on communities. “There are thousands of small human stories of stress, worry and disappointment,” said Rachel Buchanan, from the Ludlow area in Shropshire. “We’re all looking at river level websites now before going out. It just makes everyone a little less willing to leave their home.”\nPeople are being prevented from getting to work and social events, caring for family members and attending to livestock, and are becoming ever more lonely, Buchanan believes.\n“You become slightly more isolated as the effects of the flooding encroach on everyday life,” she said. “A friend of mine who is a single mother simply won’t go out now. Small businesses are losing a day or a week of work and the roads are crumbling – it’s a mess.”\nAll across the UK, flooding has become more frequent and the impact can be felt years later. While insurance agents visit to assess how much compensation is to be paid out, houses in areas not previously classified as being at risk of flooding are revalued.\nQuick guide\nHow global heating is causing more extreme weather\nShow\nGreenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\nHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.\nHotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\nAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.\nWhen these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\nMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.\nGlobal heating does not influence all extreme weather – natural variability still exists. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.\nWas this helpful?\n“One of our neighbours lost £70,000 in value,” says Ian Young, a father of two who lives with his partner on the Isle of Man and who was affected by flooding last year. “We lost both our cars and did not receive market value for them. Our premiums went through the roof as they had to go down as at-fault claims even though the vehicles were parked on the driveway and we weren’t in them.”\nHe and his family have been living in temporary accommodation since the beginning of October and work to repair his property, the ground floor of which was completely flooded, has only just begun.\n“It was absolutely horrific,” he said. “You spend years trying to build up your life centred around your home and garden and then you’re kicked out. We’ve lost a Christmas with our kids. They only believe in Father Christmas until they’re eight or nine. But it was a write-off not having our own home.”\nIn Surrey, where the Thames flooded twice in 2014, residents are still dealing with the consequences. “I don’t think we ever fully recovered from the experience,” said the fluid dynamicist and racing boat maker Carl Douglas. “It knocked the momentum out of us, left us poorer and messed up our business.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAerial view of the flooded River Mole in Leatherhead, Surrey, after days of heavy rain from Storm Dennis.

But have you been under a lot of stress?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I replied,” Douglas said.\nIn many cases, communities have pulled together to help those who are most affected. In Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, which has been hit by flooding over the last couple of years, neighbours have responded by helping older people move their possessions to safety, sharing route information on Facebook, offering spare bedrooms and helping to flood-proof homes.\nBut people such as Rory Deighton, a 49-year-old NHS worker, are looking towards Westminster for real action. “If we get nothing again from a central government that ignores climate change, does not act on grouse shooting or discuss farming practices, and does not focus on how we can prevent flooding, then people will just ask: what’s the point?”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

According to Taleb, black swans are events that emerge unpredictably, like a tornado, from a fat-tailed statistical distribution. But I argued that financial crises, at least, are more like hurricanes: they are the predictable result of builtup economic and financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes.\nThere are times when we should expect the system to reach a tipping point – the “Minsky Moment” – when a boom and a bubble turn into a crash and a bust. Such events are not about the “unknown unknowns” but rather the “known unknowns”.\nBeyond the usual economic and policy risks that most financial analysts worry about, a number of potentially seismic white swans are visible on the horizon this year. Any of them could trigger severe economic, financial, political and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.\nTrump's 'America first' policy offers Beijing and Brussels a chance to lead\nBarry Eichengreen\nRead more\nFor starters, the US is locked in an escalating strategic rivalry with at least four implicitly aligned revisionist powers: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. These countries all have an interest in challenging the US-led global order and 2020 could be a critical year for them, owing to the US presidential election and the potential change in US global policies that could follow.\nUnder Donald Trump, the US is trying to contain or even trigger regime change in these four countries through economic sanctions and other means. Similarly, the four revisionists want to undercut American hard and soft power abroad by destabilising the US from within through asymmetric warfare. If the US election descends into partisan rancour, chaos, disputed vote tallies and accusations of “rigged” elections, so much the better for rivals of the US. A breakdown of the US political system would weaken American power abroad.\nMoreover, some countries have a particular interest in removing Trump. The acute threat that he poses to the Iranian regime gives it every reason to escalate the conflict with the US in the coming months – even if it means risking a full-scale war – on the chance that the ensuing spike in oil prices would crash the US stock market, trigger a recession, and sink Trump’s re-election prospects. Yes, the consensus view is that the targeted killing of Qassem Suleimani has deterred Iran but that argument misunderstands the regime’s perverse incentives. War between US and Iran is likely this year; the current calm is the one before the proverbial storm.\nAs for US-China relations, the recent phase one deal is a temporary Band-Aid. The bilateral cold war over technology, data, investment, currency and finance is already escalating sharply. The Covid-19 outbreak has reinforced the position of those in the US arguing for containment and lent further momentum to the broader trend of Sino-American “decoupling”. More immediately, the epidemic is likely to be more severe than currently expected and the disruption to the Chinese economy will have spillover effects on global supply chains – including pharma inputs, of which China is a critical supplier – and business confidence, all of which will likely be more severe than financial markets’ current complacency suggests.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nAlthough the Sino-American cold war is by definition a low-intensity conflict, a sharp escalation is likely this year. To some Chinese leaders, it cannot be a coincidence that their country is simultaneously experiencing a massive swine flu outbreak, severe bird flu, a coronavirus outbreak, political unrest in Hong Kong, the re-election of Taiwan’s pro-independence president, and stepped-up US naval operations in the East and South China Seas. Regardless of whether China has only itself to blame for some of these crises, the view in Beijing is veering toward the conspiratorial.\nAdvertisement\nBut open aggression is not really an option at this point, given the asymmetry of conventional power. China’s immediate response to US containment efforts will likely take the form of cyberwarfare. There are several obvious targets. Chinese hackers (and their Russian, North Korean, and Iranian counterparts) could interfere in the US election by flooding Americans with misinformation and deep fakes. With the US electorate already so polarised, it is not difficult to imagine armed partisans taking to the streets to challenge the results, leading to serious violence and chaos.\nRevisionist powers could also attack the US and western financial systems – including the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) platform. Already, the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, has warned that a cyber-attack on European financial markets could cost $645bn (£496.2bn). And security officials have expressed similar concerns about the US, where an even wider range of telecommunication infrastructure is potentially vulnerable.\nBy next year, the US-China conflict could have escalated from a cold war to a near hot one. A Chinese regime and economy severely damaged by the Covid-19 crisis and facing restless masses will need an external scapegoat, and will likely set its sights on Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam and US naval positions in the East and South China Seas; confrontation could creep into escalating military accidents. It could also pursue the financial “nuclear option” of dumping its holdings of US Treasury bonds if escalation does take place. Because US assets comprise such a large share of China’s (and, to a lesser extent, Russia’s) foreign reserves, the Chinese are increasingly worried that such assets could be frozen through US sanctions (like those already used against Iran and North Korea).\nOf course, dumping US Treasuries would impede China’s economic growth if dollar assets were sold and converted back into renminbi (which would appreciate). But China could diversify its reserves by converting them into another liquid asset that is less vulnerable to US primary or secondary sanctions, namely gold. Indeed, China and Russia have been stockpiling gold reserves (overtly and covertly), which explains the 30% spike in gold prices since early 2019.\nIn a sell-off scenario, the capital gains on gold would compensate for any loss incurred from dumping US Treasuries, whose yields would spike as their market price and value fell. So far, China and Russia’s shift into gold has occurred slowly, leaving Treasury yields unaffected. But if this diversification strategy accelerates, as is likely, it could trigger a shock in the US Treasuries market, possibly leading to a sharp economic slowdown in the US.\nThe US, of course, will not sit idly by while coming under asymmetric attack. It has already been increasing the pressure on these countries with sanctions and other forms of trade and financial warfare, not to mention its own world-beating cyberwarfare capabilities. US cyber-attacks against the four rivals will continue to intensify this year, raising the risk of the first-ever cyber world war and massive economic, financial and political disorder.\nAdvertisement\nLooking beyond the risk of severe geopolitical escalations in 2020, there are additional medium-term risks associated with climate change, which could trigger costly environmental disasters. Climate change is not just a lumbering giant that will cause economic and financial havoc decades from now. It is a threat in the here and now, as demonstrated by the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nIn addition to climate change, there is evidence that separate, deeper seismic events are under way, leading to rapid global movements in magnetic polarity and accelerating ocean currents. Any one of these developments could augur an environmental white swan event, as could climatic “tipping points” such as the collapse of major ice sheets in Antarctica or Greenland in the next few years. We already know that underwater volcanic activity is increasing; what if that trend translates into rapid marine acidification and the depletion of global fish stocks upon which billions of people rely?\nAs of early 2020, this is where we stand: the US and Iran have already had a military confrontation that will likely soon escalate; China is in the grip of a viral outbreak that could become a global pandemic; cyberwarfare is ongoing; major holders of US Treasuries are pursuing diversification strategies; the Democratic presidential primary is exposing rifts in the opposition to Trump and already casting doubt on vote-counting processes; rivalries between the US and four revisionist powers are escalating; and the real-world costs of climate change and other environmental trends are mounting.\nThis list is hardly exhaustive but it points to what one can reasonably expect for 2020. Financial markets, meanwhile, remain blissfully in denial of the risks, convinced that a calm if not happy year awaits major economies and global markets.\n• Nouriel Roubini is a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and was senior economist for international affairs in the Clinton White House’s Council of Economic Advisers.

The Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, Niger, and Mali are the bottom five in the list, based on the same ranking.\nBut when performance is compared taking per capita carbon emissions into account, Burundi, Chad and Somalia are best performers, while the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia are among the bottom 10 countries.\n“When authors took per capita CO2 emissions into account, the top countries [on the child flourishing ranking] trail behind: Norway ranked 156, the Republic of Korea 166, and the Netherlands 160,” the report says. “Each of the three emits 210% more CO2 per capita than their 2030 target.”\n“The only countries on track to beat CO2 emission per capita targets by 2030, while also performing fairly (within the top 70) on child flourishing measures are: Albania, Armenia, Grenada, Jordan, Moldova, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uruguay and Vietnam,” the report says.\nThe UK is ranked among the top 10 countries when it comes to child flourishing, but placed 133rd on “delivering on emissions targets”; it is “currently on track to emit 115% more CO2 than its 2030 emissions target”.\nExperts behind the report agree that “while the poorest countries need to do more to support their children’s ability to live healthy lives, excessive carbon emissions – disproportionately from wealthier countries – threaten the future of all children”.\nStefan Peterson, Unicef’s chief of health, said children living in the poorest countries are facing the brunt of a changing climate, despite having a tiny carbon footprint.\n'Failing' food system leaves millions of children malnourished or overweight\nRead more\n“These children face enormous challenges to their health and wellbeing, and are also now at the greatest disadvantage due to the climate crisis,” he said. “We need sustainable gains in child health and development, which means that big carbon emitters need to reduce their emissions for all children to thrive, poor and rich.”\nThe report says: “If global warming exceeds 4C by the year 2100 in line with current projections, this would lead to devastating health consequences for children, due to rising ocean levels, heatwaves, proliferation of diseases like malaria and dengue, and malnutrition.”\nAnthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said the commission was calling for a radical rethink on global child health.\n“Climate change threatens our children’s future so we must stop carbon emissions as soon as possible,” he told the Guardian. “Our new index shows that not a single country performed well on both child development and emissions indicators.\n“We also call for greater regulation of marketing of tobacco, alcohol, formula milk, sugar-sweetened beverages and gambling to children, and of social media companies which target children through secret algorithms and the inappropriate use of their personal data.”\nThe report says children are at risk from harmful marketing. “Evidence suggests that children in some countries see as many as 30,000 advertisements on television alone in a single year, while youth exposure to vaping (e-cigarettes) advertisements increased by more than 250% in the US over two years, reaching more than 24 million young people.”\nIndustry self-regulation has failed, said Costello, adding that in Australia, for instance, “children and adolescent viewers were still exposed to 51 million alcohol ads during just one year of televised football, cricket and rugby”.\n“The reality could be much worse still,” he said. “We have few facts and figures about the huge expansion of social media advertising and algorithms aimed at our children.”\nThe commission calls on governments to put measures in place “to ensure children receive their rights and entitlements now and a liveable planet in the years to come”.\n“We live in an era like no other. Our children face a future of great opportunity, but they stand on the precipice of a climate crisis … our challenge is great and we seem to be paralysed,” it says.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It may produce less coal from mines in Australia and South Africa, too.\nThe Switzerland-based miner has also vowed to disclose its contribution to the climate crisis and show investors how it plans to align its business with the Paris climate goals from April this year.\nGlencore has yet to set a target to reduce its full climate impact because it does not include the so-called scope 3 emissions, which would take account of the emissions produced from using the coal it sells.\nIvan Glasenberg, the chief executive of Glencore, described climate targets like BP’s aim to be a “net zero” company by 2050 as “wishy-washy” because the goals are “a long way out”.\n“As we rebalance our portfolio towards commodities supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, we expect the intensity of our scope 3 emissions to decrease,” a statement from Glencore said. “Starting in 2020, we will start disclosing our longer-term projections for the intensity reduction of scope 3 emissions, including mitigation efforts.”\nMining firms worked to kill off climate action in Australia, says ex-PM\nRead more\nThe mining company’s existing targets cover its direct greenhouse gas emissions, and the emissions produced from its operations.

BloombergNEF estimates that coal’s role in the global power mix will fall from 37% today to 12% by 2050.\nGlasenberg said the company was also “spending a lot of money on carbon capture” technology that could help to reduce the climate impact of coal by trapping the emissions before they can contribute to global heating.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A political war chest in the US to counter the pernicious influence of big oil? Or research funding for “moonshot” technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere?\nThe world’s richest man is never going to be short of suggestions for how to spend money, but Jeff Bezos’s announcement of a new $10bn (£7.67bn) Earth Fund to fight global heating has raised the question of what is the best bang for a climate buck.\nIn an Instagram post to his 1.4 million followers, the Amazon founder said he would start distributing funds this summer and hoped to work alongside scientists, activists and NGOs to “amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet”.\nThe fund is controversial. Some campaigners believe Bezos – whose personal net worth is almost $130bn – should have used the money to pay more in taxes, or higher wages.\nAdvertisement\nOthers suggest the creation of a political fighting fund to counter the influence of lobbyists in the oil and gas industry, who have delayed climate action for decades. The top five petrochemical companies spend about $200m a year on advertising, briefing and campaign donations aimed at blocking carbon taxes, extolling the benefits of their industry and misleading the public about the risks.\n“At this point, I think confronting the fossil fuel industry head-on – and the financial industry that supports it – is what is required,” said the US author, environmentalist and founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben. “If a plutocrat was willing to do that, it would be an interesting battle of titans. I’m not holding my breath, however.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nCounterintuitively, the high-tech multibillionaire is urged to invest in natural solutions. Studies have shown one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide is to protect forests and support indigenous and traditional community land rights.\n“Strengthening the Amazon and other rainforests is vital if the world is to have any chance of stabilising the climate. When healthy they are the biggest terrestrial carbon sink. When attacked by fire, they are a huge source of emissions,” said Marcelo Salazar of Brazil’s biggest environment NGO, Instituto Socioambiental.\nHe said “Amazon for the Amazon” funding could be used to shift the rainforest towards a new model of business and governance that relied less on destructive practices like deforestation and mining, and more on the renewable use of biodiverse fruits, nuts and natural oils that would allow indigenous people and other forest guardians to thrive.\nAnother proposal is to develop game-changing technologies that are too risky for business or too expensive for governments. “Many emerging technologies, like carbon capture and storage, need a financial shot in the arm to get them scaled up fast. Other solutions, such as the expansion of climate-smart farming or universal wastewater treatment, may be less eye-catching but they are no less crucial in terms of cutting emissions and providing greater resilience to the impacts of climate change,” said Prof Dave Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation.\nProf Richard Templer, director of innovation at the Grantham Institute, said his “cheeky suggestion” would be that the money be committed to areas where science demands action but markets do not yet exist, such as removing carbon dioxide from the air and restoring habitats – including forests and wetlands – that can reduce emissions.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAmazon workers gather in front of ‘the spheres’, part of the company’s HQ, to participate in a climate strike in late 2019. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP\nNew technology should not be necessary. Bob Ward, also of the Grantham Institute, suggested Bezos use the fund to overcome societal obstacles to net zero emissions through a global programme of research, analysis and engagement. “Some of this money should be targeted at the United States, Canada and Australia to, for instance, support local media to report and counter misinformation about the local impacts of climate change, and to build support for climate action among centre-right politicians and their supporters. The money should also be targeted at exploring options for managing a just transition among workers and communities around the world that are currently dependent on high-carbon industries,” he said.\nOwen Gaffney, an analyst and strategist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the Stockholm Resilience Centre said the key was to instil trust in liberal democracies to allow them to make big long-term decisions for the benefit of most people. “This means investing in solutions to reduce inequality and pricing carbon fairly,” he said.\nClimate economists said more support for carbon pricing had the greater potential to trigger a wave of positive developments. “Carbon pricing can do three things: make fossil fuel use less attractive, make clean technologies more profitable, and generate income for governments to give back to their citizens by means of tax cuts or infrastructure investments,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the director of the Potsdam Institute. “That’s no easy thing. Yet this is why it needs some push.”\nMcKibben said the world’s richest man would probably never have taken this step without pressure from a staff organisation, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. This advocacy group has criticised their boss for supporting the oil and gas industry and for donating money to business groups that have lobbied against climate action. Earlier this year, 340 of them risked being fired by signing an online petition against Amazon rules that bar employees from speaking about the company’s business without approval from management.\nHey, Jeff Bezos: I work for Amazon – and I'm protesting against your firm's climate inaction\nRead more\nIn response to Bezos’s announcement of the new fund, the group called for action as well as money.\n“We applaud Jeff Bezos’s philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,” the group said in a statement. “The people of Earth need to know: when is Amazon going to stop helping oil & gas companies ravage Earth with still more oil and gas wells?”\nOne idea is for Bezos to channel the $10bn through this group of climate justice advocates inside his company. “The mere fact that he thought it necessary to do this is because so many people – including his employees – have been organising so powerfully. So, in the end, I’ll put my faith in movements, not money,” McKibben said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn’t mind. We were all in the same boat.\nI was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it; and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht – our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand.\nThe longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Galápagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time.\nI grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals – you came to really anticipate meals – and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties.\nNot long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep – partly because artificial light drained the boat’s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky – being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.)\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Not long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep’. Photograph: Drew Buckley/Alamy\nWhen we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn’t come.\nThat transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg’s voyage to New York last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world’s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either “complete or comprehensive”.\nConnections made by sea “have brought together peoples, religions and civilisations” through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge – and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“Even if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it – the ‘sea of darkness’ and then, on the other hand, ‘the isles of the blessed’ – the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.”\nI see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. “He’s only happy at sea,” says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children.\nMy parents remain “liveaboards”, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPortuguese explorers arriving in Kolkata in 1498, painted by Alfredo Gameiro. Shipping spices from India was a lucrative industry for Portugal. Photograph: Alamy\nAdvertisement\nYet for most of history there has also been “a mercenary dimension” to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, “the wish to exploit”: “You know you’re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.” Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the Silk Road; in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death.\nThe movement of not just goods, but people has been another constant – whether their migration was forced, such as by invasion or the slave trade; or voluntary, in search of a new life and opportunities. Passages have been guided by the trade winds and currents that drive climate and weather all over the world. More than 70% of the globe is covered by ocean; it produces around half the oxygen we breathe, and absorbs half of all man-made carbon dioxide.\nAt many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas – but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe – the knot in my hair might attest – its quality.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nElle Hunt aged about nine in the bosun’s chair, with her father Anthony.\nAt the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I’m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared – that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either – just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky; an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you.\nIt is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course – but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave – my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere.\nEven as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of “blue space”, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature.\nAdvertisement\nMore significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water – its literal immersiveness – can force attention outwards, beyond the self. But these effects on mood tend to be most acute at coastal margins, where the sea meets the land. “The optimal environment has both,” says Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth. “If you’ve ever been on a cruise, or crossed to France, it’s pretty boring out there when you can’t see the coast.”\nAs a crew member on the inaugural voyage from New York to Macau in 1784 grumbled of their smooth passage: “It has been one dreary waste of sky & water, without a pleasing sight to cheer us.” Abulafia paraphrased: “One went to sea for excitement, and all that happened was that the captain fell against a railing and bruised his head and arm.” He suspects that some ships’ diarists exaggerated the risk of storms and shipwreck so as to enliven accounts “of a flat sea and neutral sky for days and days”.\nYet, in imagining a life at sea, most people seem less inclined to think of tedium than terror. Many have told me that the thought of being stranded in the open ocean is one of their greatest fears; I’m not sure that they would single out being lost in a forest, for example, or on a snowy mountain in the same way, though all three landscapes are alien and potentially dangerous.\nIn fact the first question I am most often asked about my childhood is “Were there any storms?” or, more to the point: “Were you scared?” The answers are yes, only one, a freak occurrence overnight; and no – I slept through it. My parents were highly risk-averse, setting out for sea only when the weather forecast was favourable and they had supplies – food, medical, electrical – to account for every possible eventuality.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nHMS Erebus in the Ice, 1846, by François Etienne Musin.

Whether or not this idea appeals to you was found by data scientists at the dating app OkCupid to be one of the strongest predictors of romantic compatibility; I know enough to answer no.\nBoth scenarios, the worst-case and the rose-tinted, are telling of the disconnect most people feel from the ocean. A sense of trepidation has figured in seafaring through history, except among those whose knowledge and mastery of the ocean was evolved over several millennia to seem almost innate – the early Polynesian navigators of the Pacific, the ancestors of the New Zealand Māori and Hawaiians.\nThere could be a genetic predisposition towards how we feel about travelling the seas: DRD 4-7R, the so-called “wanderlust” gene, is thought to be present in about 20% of the population. In his book On the Ocean, the archaeologist Sir Barry Cunliffe pointed to scientific findings that this impulse to travel, “to satisfy an innate curiosity”, could be one explanation for why “the unknown engages the human imagination, and draws the curious out of the familiar place they inhabit into the threatening, but ever exciting space beyond”.\nEven if my parents have wanderlust in their DNA, I’m not sure it was handed down to me. Though I spent the first half of my life sailing, I acquired none of the skills – I couldn’t even manage a bowline knot. I have blamed it on my being a child, but the truth is I have never had any interest in boats beyond as a means of accessing the open ocean.\nI still feel a strong connection to the sea – but it has been challenging to maintain in my adult life, from the tower block in south London where I now live. When I am struggling to get to sleep I play ocean sounds through my phone, a crude attempt to simulate the limitlessness, even transcendence, I remember feeling out in open water.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTuvulu, in the south Pacific, was among the islands travelled to by early Polynesian explorers.

You can be claimed by the sea without drowning. I feel its absence on a bodily level like a mineral deficiency, and make regular visits to the coast to “top up”, as the geographer Catherine Kelly evocatively put it. Now, although long-distance passenger travel by sea has become almost unheard of, Thunberg’s voyage across the Atlantic, and the growing “no-fly” movement to cut down on carbon emissions, could suggest turning tides.\nI didn't want to fly – so I took a cargo ship from Germany to Canada\nRead more\nThe oceans face considerable challenges themselves, from plastic pollution and deep-sea oil drilling, to unsustainable shipping and fishing. The rising acidity of the Pacific Ocean is causing crabs’ shells to dissolve. Warming temperatures have already opened up new trade routes over the top of Russia and Canada. We face the beginning of a new chapter in the history of oceans – for us along with them.\nAbulafia notes that rising sea levels have been suggested as a precipitating factor in past migration, forcing people to go in search of new land. A study last year predicted that warming temperatures will raise sea levels by 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the contribution from melting ice and glaciers.\nThese are uncharted waters that humanity is navigating – but not, there is some comfort in acknowledging, for the first time.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Some days they disappear in seconds, but on others, when the air is already full of moisture, they join together to form cirrus clouds which can linger for up to 18 hours. They make the sun hazy and prevent heat escaping back into space from the atmosphere, adding to climate warming.\nScientists from Imperial College London calculate that these contrails add as much again to heating the atmosphere as the carbon dioxide produced by the aircraft but have found a solution. By altering the altitude of aircraft flying into humid air up or down by 2,000ft (610 metres) to reach drier layers, the formation of contrails and the resultant warming is cut by 59%.\nEven better, if the airlines used cleaner engines to produce less black carbon from their fuel, the vapour trails would rarely form at all. The ice crystals need the unburned specks of carbon as a base to form the contrails in the first place.\nThe two improvements combined would cut contrail heating by 90%. For an industry under increasing pressure because of its rising contribution to the climate crisis, getting rid of contrails would at least show willing.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Only structural change will","paragraph":"As we enter 2020 and survey the state of the world, two competing storylines seem to dominate the present.\nThe first is ruthless, relentless inequality. We see this not only in the imbalance of our economy, but also in our politics and government, in education and expression, and in the ways that our social structures and cultural practices dismiss and disregard people because of their gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and more.\nThen there is the corollary: People standing up, speaking out, and fighting back. Young, inspirational figures like Kynan Tegar, Greta Thunberg, and Artemisa Xakriabá are spearheading movements to address the global climate crisis, because their future is at risk. And in places like Hong Kong, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Sudan and many others around the globe, ordinary citizens are demanding better treatment, more transparency, greater equality, and human dignity. They demonstrate, time and again, their willingness to sacrifice everything – their time, their efforts, even their safety – in service of a better future for us all.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately, the truth is, the courageous individuals leading the change – the people driving the conversation and making the largest sacrifices – too often are the very people most threatened by inequality. And so, I find myself asking: Why is it that those with the least tend to sacrifice the most? How can it be that the most comfortable among us contribute, in relative terms, the least? What crisis needs to befall us in order to act?\nTo be sure, many with power and privilege already give with extraordinary generosity. As the president of the Ford Foundation, an organization originally endowed by a family of great means, I have seen firsthand how the generosity of a few can affect the lives of many.\nBut this kind of generosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice – which we see both day to day and in the data. For example, a survey from The Chronicle of Philanthropy found that, during the Great Recession, American households that earned more than $200,000 reduced their giving by more than 4%, while households that earned less than $100,000 did just the opposite. In fact, as they saw the need increase, they increased their giving, in turn – by more than 4%. And this despite the fact that tax codes in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world have built-in incentives that reward the wealthy for their charitable donations.\nGenerosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice\nThis all-too-common discomfort with sacrifice is not about good versus bad. The disconnect – and disconnection – follows from isolation and insulation. Separation breeds selfishness, despite the best of intentions.\nIn the United States, for instance, segregation was outlawed over 65 years ago. Yet, a recent Civil Rights Project report found that America’s schools remain both separate and unequal. We see similar trends of geographical divide in cities across America and Europe, where a lack of economic opportunity has led to the disintegration of our social fabric.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nRestoring unity and trust will take more than generosity and good will. Charity, while wonderful, ameliorates the symptoms of inequality, but it does not address its root causes. And we must address the root causes. Keep in mind that large swaths of people around the world are growing increasingly impatient with the status quo, and we with power will feel their ire if we ignore their righteous demands for a fair and just society. So those of us with privilege need to find ways to do more justice. That means not only helping those who are often excluded, but also undoing the systems and structures that create inequities and imbalances in the first place. That will sometimes also mean working to transfer our own power, and giving up some of the privileges we currently enjoy.\nToward the end of last year, when our foundation hosted a conference on the future of philanthropy, I was struck by something Luis Miranda Jr, philanthropist and father of the entertainer Lin-Manuel Miranda, said about the philosophy with which he was raised. “If it doesn’t hurt,” Miranda argued, “if you’re not not-doing something else, then you’re not giving enough.”\nThis conception of sacrifice is profound: only when it is uncomfortable or even painful to give do you know that you are giving for reasons beyond your own benefit. And it is worth remembering that, despite this prick of pain, sacrifice has a value beyond what is given up. When you make this kind of sacrifice, you do not give up something for nothing; you give up some of your privilege for something far more valuable: justice.\nIf we want to address the inequality of sacrifice, therefore, those of us with the most ought to recommit ourselves to doing the most. Perhaps that means paying a higher tax rate to finance public goods or wielding our influence to promote inclusive public policies. Or perhaps it means devoting more time, money, and effort toward rebuilding the broken systems that perpetuate inequality.\nWe all must ask ourselves what system, status, or status quo we are willing to part with to benefit others. Only then – only when we have paired our generous impulses with acts of justice – will we diminish the inequality of sacrifice, and build a better, more equitable world.\nDarren Walker is president of the Ford Foundation\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Over four weekends they will discuss a range of issues with experts and decide on a set of recommendations for how the government can reach its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.\nAssembly member Leia, 20, from Darlington, said giving up her time for the cause was an easy decision to make: “You don’t get an opportunity to influence government policy very often and climate change is really important.”\nAnother participant, Amanda, 56, a healthcare project manager from Kent, said: “I was really chuffed to be chosen. There were some things which I didn’t know about that I’ve learned today, which is really interesting, but I’ve always been quite green.”\nInvitations to the assembly were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random, and of the over 1,500 people who responded asking to be considered, 110 were selected by a computer to be representative of society. There’s a mix of ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds and education levels, but also a range of views about the climate crisis.\nQ&A\nWhat is a citizen's assembly?\nShow\nA citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to the definition put forward by the House of Commons library.\nCitizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations.\nFacilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.\nThe people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class.\nThe number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections.\nCitizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue.\nJamie Grierson, Home affairs correspondent\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nChris, a 32-year-old production engineer and father of two from Oxford, was unsure of the severity of the problem. “I wasn’t sure if it was a crisis. I’m not a climate denier as people will quite quickly say. Climate is real, it does change, it has changed. I appreciate man is changing it. But whether we’re at the level of crisis – I hadn’t seen enough information.”\nHe was keen to hear directly from experts, and was pleased to see opinions being distinguished from facts. “My biggest fear coming here is that a decision would be made purely based on emotion with no logical steps or thought about the implementation or the impact.”\nThe assembly heard from speakers at organisations including Natural England, the New Economics Foundation and Wellcome, and were given the chance to ask questions. Some of these were practical – “What’s more environmentally friendly, British beef or avocados?” – while some were more ethical – “How can we ensure the cost of changes don’t affect poorer people disproportionately?”\nParticipants could hold up a yellow card if a speaker was going too fast, or a red card if they needed something explained or clarified. “It’s about distilling down the enormous complexity of climate change into small pieces of information that are accessible, balanced and meaningful for people, so it is quite a tall order,” said Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, the director of the UK Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations, and one of the assembly’s expert leads.\n“Some people are probably totally comfortable with a lot of what’s been covered today, and some people will have never really heard anything of this kind before.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nMembers of the citizens’ assembly on climate change on their first weekend of discussions in Birmingham. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/PA\nThe day culminated with a talk from Sir David Attenborough, who was keen to give his thanks to the volunteers for giving up their time.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“If you have a parliament of a fixed length of five years, it is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry to an issue which is not going to come to a climax – and people won’t know if it is successful or not successful – for 10 years, 15 years hence,” he said.\n“Your very existence here means members of parliament are taking it seriously. The people in this country ought to be extremely grateful to you, as indeed am I.”\nCaroline Lucas, the Green party MP, observed the morning session and said she was impressed by the level of engagement from members. “The buzz in the room was brilliant. I just think it’s so important that politics is done with people, not to them … Look what happened with the gilets jaunes in Paris – people have to understand and feel as if they are part of the process.”\nShe said her biggest concern was that the assembly discussions were based on the assumption that net-zero emissions should be achieved by 2050 and not earlier, but organisers said there would be time at the end of the process for members to discuss this if they wanted to.\nQuick guide\nWhat zero emissions in 2050 would mean for the UK\nShow\nThe Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:\n• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.\n• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.\n• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\n• Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.\n• A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes.\n• 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.\n• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.\nWas this helpful?\nThe government signed legislation last year to commit the country to net-zero emissions by 2050, although the Green party campaigns for a 2030 deadline, a target also supported by Labour.\nThe assembly has drawn some criticism over the fact the recommendations will not be legally binding. Lucas said: “Although the government aren’t obliged to take the recommendations seriously, I think for a government that has said it wants to [make the UK] the greenest country in the world, it would be quite difficult for them to completely sideline these views.” The results from the assembly will be made public in April, and a House of Commons debate will follow.\nAt just 17, Max from Hertfordshire was one of the youngest members of the assembly, and he was optimistic over the impact it could have: “If this whole thing ends up making a big difference, and the government really does listen, it means we’ll be leading a new movement internationally, and we need to be the leaders of a better tomorrow.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

The findings make it “inconceivable” that they will become carbon neutral within 30 years, as the government has mandated.\nAccording to the survey, 43% of councils – 93 of the 214 local authorities that responded to a freedom of information request from electrical contractors’ trade body ECA – do not measure the energy they use in council-owned buildings or know how much carbon they produce.\nECA energy adviser Luke Osborne said the findings were “highly concerning”. Without immediate changes, “it is inconceivable that councils are going to become carbon neutral in less than 30 years”, he said.\nClimate crisis: can councils deliver on bold promises to cut emissions?\nRead more\nDespite 78% of councils in the survey saying they are planning towards net zero operation by 2050, 47% say they do not have a strategy in place to reduce the carbon emissions from housing, offices and other buildings.\nOf the 49 councils in the survey that stated they would be carbon neutral by 2030, 11 do not know their current carbon footprint.\nCouncil buildings pump out large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). On average, a council HQ building emits 1,234 tonnes of CO2 a year, according to ECA. Overall, English council headquarters emit more than 250,000 tonnes of CO2 a year – the equivalent of 150,000 return flights from London to New York.\nMany councils have older, energy inefficient buildings, said Osborne, but there are simple measures that could be implemented quickly, such as switching to LED lighting and monitoring occupancy levels. “There is a lot of rhetoric out there, but very few action plans,” he said.\nThere are 408 councils in England, of which 265 (65%) have declared a climate emergency, ranging from cities such as Nottingham, Bristol and Oxford to district councils such as Adur & Worthing, which says all its pool cars will be hybrid by this summer.\nVery, very few authorities have the resources, financial, technical or otherwise, to make the changes they need\nChaitanya Kumar, Green Alliance\nBut experts say councils are still not doing enough, due to government cuts and the lack of national standards on climate action. “There are some brilliant plans, but they tend to be in the larger metropolitan areas, driven by local leaders and metro mayors,” said Jess Britton, a research fellow at Exeter University. “Declaring a climate emergency and having a realistic plan are two hugely different things.”\nBritton’s research into local climate strategies includes a call for a new national framework on climate action, which she said would enable councils to bring local organisations together to tackle the crisis.\nAdvertisement\nEnvironmental law firm ClientEarth said last September that dozens of councils were set to miss the government’s net-zero target for 2050 and warned of a collective failure by local authorities across England to plan adequately for climate change. Council climate pledges have to jostle with local development demands. Manchester city council’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2038, for example, has not only been criticised for being unambitious, but explicitly excludes Manchester Airport, which is part-owned by the council, and where a new £50m car park is being planned.\nLast week the Local Government Association, which represents local authorities, held its first climate emergency conference for councils. Chaitanya Kumar, head of climate and energy at the Green Alliance thinktank, said government cuts have made it difficult for councils to tackle the climate crisis, despite growing pressure from citizens to act. “Very, very few authorities have the resources, financial, technical or otherwise, to make the changes they need,” he said. Councils are concerned about the imposition of any statutory duty to act over the climate crisis unless they are also given additional resources, he added.\nGet Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals\nRead more\nThis weekend, the first-ever UK citizens’ climate assembly took place, at which 110 people gathered to come up with a plan to tackle global heating and meet the government’s 2050 target. It remains to be seen how the national assembly will marry up with various local groups being convened in places such as Devon and Oxford, said Britton.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But there is one photograph he hasn’t been so keen to share with his 730,000 followers: of him standing next to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right president, with the uneasy smile of a man who’s just secured his latest big commission from another unsavoury despot, in this case one who has boasted of being “proudly” homophobic.\nAccording to a statement from Brazil’s ministry of tourism, Ingels visited Brazil to tour several states and discuss strategies for developing sustainable tourism on its north-east coast, in partnership with the Nômade Group, which recently built an eco-conscious luxury resort in Tulum, the ruins of a Mayan walled city in Mexico.\n“They’ve pioneered this incredible barefoot light-impact environment,” says Ingels, speaking by phone from Santiago in Chile. “It’s a model of tourism development that doesn’t replace the forest or the sand, but strengthens and preserves it. It’s a very welcome alternative to the kind of high-rise hotels that spring up on the beach in many places.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAnd here’s me with the homophobic, climate-crisis-denying president … Bjarke Ingels, centre, meets Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, second left. Photograph: Marcos Correa\nSuch an eco-conscious approach doesn’t seem to chime with Bolsonaro’s reactionary regime. Since he came to power last January, Brazil’s president has confirmed every fear that he would be a “Trump of the tropics”. He has appointed climate-change deniers to prominent roles, dismissed deforestation statistics as fake news, and sacked the head of the institute that undertook the research. Last year, he played down the worst fires for a decade in the Amazon, calling the global outcry the result of “deceitful” media hype. He once said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one, rails against Brazil becoming a “gay tourism paradise”, and his recent introduction of abstinence-based sex education has been likened to “going back 40 years”.\nAdvertisement\nSo what is Ingels, self-styled seer of a progressive liberal world, doing with such a figure? “I’m happy to share the ideas and ideals that I hold with any government willing to listen,” he says, “especially if they hold different beliefs. If there’s a responsibility that comes from the creative platform we’ve created, it is to use that platform to change the world for the better.” He says that the political leaders of the north-eastern Brazilian states they visited are “from the opposite end of the political spectrum” to Bolsonaro, adding that ultimately “great ideas transcend political parties”.\nOver the last few years, Ingels has gone from being the mischievous young designer of mountain-shaped apartment blocks on the outskirts of Copenhagen, to becoming the go-to celebrity architect for some of the world’s biggest corporations. Now 45, he has recently popped up as the face of everything from Hyperloop to WeWork, and is currently designing a city-sized HQ for Google in California. Then there’s his actual city for Toyota in Japan, right under Mount Fuji.But most audacious of all, he tells me, is the masterplan he is now working on for the whole of Earth – provisionally titled The Masterplanet.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCalling card … how BIG’s Toyota city will look. Photograph: BIG\nAdvertisement\nHis status as big tech’s cheeky go-to boy is perhaps what also makes him so attractive to a growing client base of autocrats. Both kinds of patron share an insatiable desire to shape every aspect of the world to their exacting vision, be it a future of autonomous vehicles, or a world where the Amazon rainforest is seen as a “virgin” that should be “exploited”, as the climate-crisis-denying Bolsonaro has put it.\nBIG, which stand for Bjarke Ingels Group, is also engaged in several major projects in Saudi Arabia, including a new leisure resort city called Qiddiya, 45km from Riyadh, billed as a new “capital of entertainment”; there’s also a confidential project that Ingels describes as “a human-made ecosystem that is as close to a utopia as you dare imagine”. Would this be a utopia that had – in accordance with Saudi law – flogging for drunkenness, amputation for robbery and extrajudicial killing for anyone criticising the regime?\n“I do sincerely believe that the urban transformation of Saudi Arabia that we’re taking part in is part of paving a path to a clearly needed social and cultural reform of the country,” says Ingels. Following the state-sanctioned murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, he says his office debated whether to pull out of the projects (as Norman Foster did), but decided they could do more good by continuing to engage.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDarling of the Gulf monarchs … Jean Nouvel with a model of his Louvre Abu Dhabi. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP via Getty Images\n“The road to ethical impact as an architect is to [propose] the future we want to companies and governments,” he says, “even if they have different views. We have to embrace our differences if we want to create a future that is different.” It’s easy to dismiss his words as naively optimistic, like a TED Talk for dictators, but he has a point – architecture and cities long outlast the ideologies that created them. But they do also reinforce the politics of their sponsors.\nIngels is by no means alone. French architect Jean Nouvel has become the darling of the autocratic Gulf monarchs, designing the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the National Museum of Qatar and now a luxury resort in Saudi Arabia. He has in the past dismissed the issue of human rights as “an old question”, echoing the response of the late Zaha Hadid, architect of the vulva-shaped stadium in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. “I have nothing to do with the workers,” Hadid said when challenged about the fact that hundreds of migrant workers had died on construction projects in Qatar. “I think that’s an issue the government – if there’s a problem – should pick up. It’s not my duty as an architect to look at it.”\nAdvertisement\nDutch architect Rem Koolhaas was equally frank about his work in China, when asked about designing the enormous HQ of China Central Television, the chief organ of state propaganda. “A position of resistance seems somehow ornamental,” he said. “On our own, we can at most have good intentions. But we cannot represent the public good without the larger entity, such as the state.” Revealing the allure of totalitarian regimes, he added: “To make matters worse, the more radical, innovative and brotherly our sentiments, the more we architects need a strong sponsor.”\nSharing Ingels’ belief that architects can effect change from within, Jacques Herzog compared his work on the Birds Nest – the 2008 Beijing Olympic stadium – to designing a “Trojan horse”. He told German newspaper Der Spiegel that “only an idiot” would have turned down the project on moral grounds, adding that his firm’s design creates “all kinds of niches” and “meeting places” around the edge of its latticework structure, hidden away from government surveillance.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Trojan horse’ … Beijing’s Birds Nest, which apparently has niches for people to hide from surveillance. Photograph: CaoWei/Getty Images\nThis is a recurring theme. Whenever the topic of ethics comes up, most architects who work in repressive climates believe their projects can transcend the abuses of the host regimes and make everyday life a bit better for the people who live there. The dilemma is whether to boycott or engage. Should a well-intentioned architect avoid working with any system they disagree with – or hope that the conditions of workers, or freedom of speech, might be improved by using their platform to raise these issues?\nSign up to the Art Weekly email\nRead more\n“It’s just surface rhetoric,” says Jeremy Till, dean of Central Saint Martins art school in London and author of Architecture Depends, which examined the discipline’s relationship with money and power. “The idea that a single building is going to be emancipatory for a whole totalitarian state is ridiculous.”\nTill was involved in the RIBA’s recent ethics report, which asserted an “unequivocal commitment” to placing public interest, social purpose and sustainable development at the heart of RIBA activities. He is particularly critical of some of the practices that have signed the recent Architects Declare manifesto, pledging to advocate for low-carbon, eco-friendly development – while also designing airports. “There are some architects who abdicate their responsibility,” he says. “I do understand that – but then they shouldn’t virtue-signal by signing up to these agreements.”\nAs for Ingels’ latest foray into the tropics, Till doesn’t hold out much hope. “It’s a fantasy that by doing a nice greenwash project in the north-east of Brazil, you are going to save the nation from fascism.”\nIngels differs. “The proof will be in the pudding,” he says. “I don’t know if we’re going to succeed in bringing positive change, or come up with a great alternative to the traditional developments that destroy the landscape and debase the local community. But we will definitely not succeed if we don’t even try.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Campaigners want the court to ensure Total does more to curb its emissions.\nTotal is on the list of top 20 global fossil fuel companies whose joint exploitation of the world’s oil, gas and coal reserves can be directly linked to more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era, according to analysis last year.\nThe towns and local authorities that have brought the case range from Bayonne, in the south-west, to La Possession, on Réunion island in the Indian Ocean, and Sevran, north of Paris. They argue that the climate emergency is already being felt by ordinary citizens and not enough is being done by large firms.\nUnder a French law called the duty of vigilance, large companies must set out clear measures to any prevent human rights violations or environmental damage resulting from their activities.\nThe non-governmental organisations bringing the case said Total had not included enough substantial detail in its vigilance plan to curb emissions, and the firm was out of step with the Paris climate agreement’s goals on limiting global heating.\nOn Tuesday, a court summons will be made in Nanterre, outside Paris.\nSandra Cossart, the head of Sherpa, a French NGO working on economic transparency and corporate-related human rights, said: “It’s the first climate litigation in France against a private company, and it aims to change that company’s strategy in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nSandra said that under the duty of vigilance law, “Total is legally required to identify the risks resulting from its contribution to global warming and to take the necessary measures to reduce its emissions.”\nShe said the case was an “important moment” to show that big companies have to step up on the climate emergency. “The more impact you have, the more responsibility you have.”\nThe French state has already faced court action over the climate emergency. Last year environmental groups including Greenpeace and Oxfam filed a legal claim against the government, accusing it of insufficient policy actions to tackle climate change. The court case was backed by an online petition signed by more than 2 million people.\nLocal authorities say private firms must also be held accountable for their role. Éric Piolle, the Green mayor of Grenoble in the Alps, said: “In Grenoble, the consequences of climate change are already visible: by 2050, Grenoble residents will experience three months of heatwaves a year, and snow will continue to disappear in winter. Glaciers are melting, mountains are crumbling.\n“Because cities are on the frontline, it is also through them that change must happen. On a daily basis we are taking steps to anticipate, limit and adapt to climate change. Together, we also have a responsibility to push the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases to lead by example.”\nTotal’s chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné, met the NGOs and local authorities bringing the case last year. The firm is expected to argue that it is meeting its obligations and will produce a report in March setting out the measures taken.\nPouyanné told a conference this month that the climate debate was “too black and white”, that change would take time and was impossible to make fossil fuels disappear with “a wave of a magic wand”.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They rescue our wildlife, defend our homes and towns, stare down fires against insuperable odds. And then they give money, often that they don’t have – to firefighters, aid agencies, the bereaved, the homeless, and animal hospitals.\nSo much giving and yet, despite it all, I can’t quieten the alarm bells in my head. Will these good intentions have good outcomes? Do we know what we are doing, as we rush to help? Can we ensure this kindness, this magnificent largesse, will truly make a difference?\nThe bushfires are a historic catastrophe of global proportions. We all know the horrifying statistics: the tragic loss of at least 33 lives, 7.7m hectares burnt, more than 1 billion animals lost, over 2,000 homes destroyed, the shocking loss – the koalas, forests of eucalypts, wallabies, kangaroos, cockatoos, bee colonies and so much more.\nAustralian government adviser urges threatened species overhaul after bushfires\nRead more\nThere is a deep body of knowledge internationally on how to best manage a national emergency, to ensure that resources are allocated based on need, fairly, effectively and accountably. I learnt about this first-hand in the dust and devastation of Nepal, working with our team during the 2015 earthquakes. These earthquakes destroyed large swathes of Kathmandu and the eastern regions of Nepal. They saw nearly 9,000 people killed, nearly 22,000 people injured, and more than 600,000 homes destroyed.\nI watched in awe at the collaboration that was on display every day as we attended “cluster meetings” to determine how to deliver shelter, food and medical treatment; how to provide for vulnerable women and children. I saw activists working with the military; community groups agreeing on who would do what, when and where; businesses making decisions after sitting with those who were delivering the services; data collected from the frontline shared every night to inform collective decision making.\nAnd when the rebuilding began, there was agreement among the key players as to the what, how, when and where to lift the country back to its feet.\nNever did I think we might have need of the same process in Australia.\nInternational organisations that have experience in disaster recovery understand the four key humanitarian principles for emergencies adopted by the UN general assembly. These may not be familiar to many here, yet they are extremely helpful in guiding decision-making for effective resource allocation.\nThe four guiding principles are humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. The humanity principle means that everyone shall be treated humanely and equally. The neutrality principle means support must be given in an impartial and independent manner. The impartiality principle speaks to the concept of non-discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, gender, religion, political opinion or class. Critically, this principle provides that support must be based on need – not for example on donor-led assumptions or political calculations. And finally, the independence principle means maintaining autonomy from political, economic, military or other calculations and acting in accordance with humanitarian principles.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nIn addition to the core principles, there are additional principles and concepts to take into account, including the concept of humanitarian accountability, succinctly described as “using power responsibly”.\nPower imbalance in a situation of emergency can be acute, and often unidentified or not understood.\nWe can learn so much from experts, including the UN. It has a remarkable process for responses to national disasters. The work is led by the UN office for coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA). It plays a vital coordination role to ensure effective humanitarian aid, resourcing and support.\nThis is what Australia urgently needs right now. A coordinated, strategic national response for delivering humanitarian action.\nIn the months ahead, there will be a critical need for a trusted collaboration structure to facilitate the recovery and rebuilding effort. Voluntary coordination mechanisms will need to be put in place that welcome all local, regional, state and federal actors.\nThat coordination mechanism would ideally be facilitated by an independent and trusted party, perhaps as an initiative funded by, but independent of, the largest philanthropists or perhaps by the National Bushfire Recovery Agency.\nBushfire recovery: how is Australia's $2bn fund being spent?\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nWhen there isn’t a sense of fairness, nor trust in effective implementation and accountability, all the pain and trauma bubbles to the surface. Those grieving, angry voices are loud on my Twitter feed and in the wider community.\nI was on the south coast of New South Wales for four long, scary weeks. Miles and miles of devastation. Fire tearing through properties to the north, west and south. Evacuations to the beach in smoke and heat. Stories of infernos and loss, of courage and of fear. And the man washing his clothes at the laundromat, who lost his home: “You know what they bloody arrived with?!” he yelled at me, “A truck full of nappies and food! Bloody nappies! We needed water! And generators!” He banged his fist to emphasise his anger, and he wept. And so it begins.\nTo make the most of all the kindness and greatness, there are answers, protocols, processes and best practice that we can tap into. The greater the coordination and collaboration, the more effective and timely the support and rebuilding will be.\nI was heartened to hear of a recent gathering in Canberra of many representatives across different sectors, coming together to talk of what happens next. Let’s hope that we are at the beginning of the greatest collaboration and coordination effort in Australian history. If ever we needed it, we need it now.\nMay the rain return, and may it keep raining kindness.\n• Audette Exel AO is founder of the Adara Group and the winner of the 2012 NSW Telstra businesswoman of the year award.

Brunel will vote against the reappointment of board members of companies that who are not doing enough, and could also sell its stakes from 2022 onwards.\nAdvertisement\nIts new policy reflects the increasing pressure on the role of the asset management sector in abetting the climate crisis. Research by InfluenceMap, a non-profit, found that the portfolios of the world’s 15 largest asset managers were overweight in polluting companies, while the largest US managers opposed the majority of climate-based shareholder votes at the companies in which they invested.\nMark Mansley, Brunel’s chief investment officer, said: “Climate change is a rapidly escalating investment issue. We found that the finance sector is part of the problem, when it could and should be part of the solution for addressing climate change.”\nBrunel’s money is spread between more than 130 investment managers, some of whom control hundreds of billions or even trillions of pounds in assets. Brunel’s managers include Aberdeen Standard, Invesco, Legal & General Investment Management, Royal London Asset Management and Wellington Management.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nWhile many asset managers have all but ignored environmental campaigners, the prospect of asset owners such as pension funds withdrawing their lucrative business has prompted some big investors to reassess their climate policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager with more than $6.9tn (£5.3tn) in assets and another manager of Brunel’s assets, last week bowed to pressure to improve its response to the climate crisis, saying it would divest from companies producing thermal coal and increasingly offer fossil fuel-free products, among other initiatives.\nBrunel said it had found short-termist thinking and an unwillingness among asset managers to invest in companies pursuing low-carbon technologies, and added that risk models used by investors often relied on flawed assumptions that did not take into account climate risks.\nEmma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “Now is the time for everyone in the finance sector to show leadership in response to the climate emergency.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Climate change is the issue of the moment and has to be tackled without delay. Governments, companies and individuals are all going to have to adjust to the new reality.\nAnybody who is not with the agenda – for example, Donald Trump – is either mad or bad. There was a big US delegation to Davos last week but it found itself isolated – in public, at least – on the climate emergency. The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum found Greta Thunberg’s call to arms much more compelling.\nLater in the year there will be a much more important event than the World Economic Forum: the UN climate change summit (COP26) in Glasgow. In Davos it was hard to move without hearing the phrase “race against time”.\nAdvertisement\nAlmost 15 years ago Nick Stern, then head of the UK Government Economic Service, produced a report on the economics of climate change in which he called the failure to deal with a heating planet the greatest market failure of all time. He argued that the benefits of early action outweighed the costs.\nLast week Prof Stern, now chair of the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said the threat was now being taken a lot more seriously. There were four reasons for that. First there was evidence, after a 1C increase in temperatures since pre-industrial times, of the failure to act. “We are seeing some pretty nasty stuff already,” he said.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nSecond, the scientific evidence was now clear that there was a big difference – for example, in the length of droughts – between a 1.5C and a 2C increase in temperatures. Third, the education system was producing a generation of young people across the world well versed in climate, sustainability and environmental issues, and they were putting pressure on their parents to act.\nYoung people wanted to know why the economics profession had been slow to include climate risks into their models, which was a justifiable criticism, Stern said. Only a tiny fraction of the papers published in economics journals have related to sustainability.\nFinally, Stern noted, an awareness was growing that there is a more attractive way of doing things. The days of the internal combustion engine were numbered, the cost of solar energy had collapsed and there had been dramatic advances in battery-storage technology.\nYet the chances are that Glasgow will not deliver as much as the scientists say is necessary. In part that’s because some important countries, including the US, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia most prominently, will resist pressure to make the commitments that are needed.\nBut it is also because the view from the bottom of the mountain is hazier than the view from the top. Consider why Emmanuel Macron did not show up at Davos this year. The French president took precisely the kind of action deemed necessary to tackle the climate emergency – whacking up the cost of driving fossil-fuelled vehicles – only to find the country erupt into protest. The message to Macron from those on low incomes was clear: don’t talk to us about the end of the world until you have told us how to make ends meet at the end of the month.\nTrump and his team see things through the lens of the yellow vest protesters. When Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, said his government was committed to taxing carbon emissions more heavily, the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, replied: “If you want to put taxes on people, go ahead and put a carbon tax. That is a tax on hardworking people.”\nIt’s easy to dismiss Mnuchin’s comments as those of a politician with his head in the sand, but he has a point. Speedy action to tackle the climate emergency requires political action. But political action will only be possible if governments can carry their voters with them. And that is not going to be possible if the measures enacted appear to be all pain and no gain.\nThe Stern report came out in 2006 and it is now 2020. In the intervening years there has been a whopping financial crisis, and a decade in which living standards for the majority of people have moved sideways. It is much easier to worry about the future of the planet if you are comfortably off and don’t have to rely on a food bank.\nThe problem – and this goes to the heart of what is wrong with Davos – is that nobody really wants to confront the issue of inequality. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the climate crisis, much talk about the need for higher investment in new technologies, and a lot of head-scratching about weak growth. What there wasn’t – as usual – was any willingness to adopt the obvious solutions.\nAny sensible person observing the World Economic Forum annual meeting from the outside would come up with the following analysis: working people are going to be less terrified about new technology if they are represented by a trade union. Growth would be higher, and less dependent on debt, if workers were able to bargain collectively. Public support for more rapid action to fight global heating would be stronger under a more progressive tax system. Entrepreneurs would develop new green technologies more quickly if governments set more onerous targets for reductions in carbon emissions.\nAll these notions are anathema to those running multinational corporations. They hate the idea of trade unions, they are ideological in their opposition to stronger states, and they recoil from the idea that they should pay more tax. But if poor people are expected to make all the sacrifices, expect some resistance. And expect the battle ahead to be long and hard.\n• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It bills itself, excitingly, as a “true crime podcast about climate change”, though the show is not quite as racy as that sounds. Rather than smack her lips over ruined corpses, the pleasantly fry-toned presenter Amy Westervelt goes into detail about the history of what she calls “big oil” (yes, she’s American). Her tale is of how fossil fuels became our fuels of choice, even once we realised that they were causing immense damage to the environment. True crime, unless you’re a Trumpian.\nHear Here podcast recommendations: sign up for unexpected audio pleasures\nRead more\nWestervelt’s approach is to research hard and then recount the story, and her show reminds me, a little bit, of Karina Longworth’s longstanding history of Hollywood’s golden years, You Must Remember This. It has that “one woman expert” feel, and the delivery is similar – not much emotion, few guests, the odd media clip, a few production tweaks. Like an extended essay, or an audio book.\nSuch an approach has advantages – it’s cheap, it gives everything weight – but it also means that the listener can drift off, especially when that listener (me) is a bit tired. I started Drilled’s new series three times before I realised I had to be walking around rather than sitting in order for Westervelt’s voice not to send me snooze-ward.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nIvy Lee: the father of spin. Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\nThe new series, which looks at how fossil fuel companies use PR to make their products more palatable, is just two episodes in and I would recommend that you go straight to these: past episodes have suffered from shoddy production and repetition. In it, Westervelt looks at Ivy Lee, who became notorious in the 1910s as the PR guy who transformed business magnate John D Rockefeller from the US’s most hated man into, seemingly, a kindly philanthropist. Shockingly, Lee was subsequently hired by the Third Reich, not necessarily to promote it, but to teach Hitler and Goebbels how to soften their language and butter up foreign journalists so their ideas seemed less appalling and more palatable. Ugh.\nWestervelt’s argument is that Lee’s PR approach forms the basis of how oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP have been presenting their wares for several years. (Though of course, it’s not just them: it’s how most big commercial interests present themselves.) Techniques such as using green as a base colour for branding, calling the product not oil, but “natural gas”, making sure you have good media relationships who will present your case rather than question it … All very interesting, and Drilled is definitely worth a listen, despite its occasionally frustrating approach.\nAdvertisement\nOver on Discovery, on the World Service, which along with Radio 4 has been highlighting many aspects of the current climate emergency, science journo Gaia Vince interviewed scientists who suffer from “ecological grief”. (She has talked about this in the Observer.) One, Steve Simpson, described how quickly and thoroughly his chosen topic of study – Australia’s coral reefs – went from thriving to, well, less so. In just a few months, through water over-heating and acidification, 80% of the reef died. A coral graveyard. Other interviewees spoke of out-of-date emergency smoke protocols in Canada. When bushfires sent lung-clogging smoke into cities, people were told to stay indoors with the windows closed. But the smoke lasted, not for a couple of days, but for months. What effect does that have on you? How small do you want your life to be?\nVince is a very traditional BBC presenter, and this programme is a very traditional World Service show: clear, workman-like, made so that audiences across the globe can understand it. No room for over-sentimentality. Still, Simpson, in the end, did have a tiny bit of good news. He played his old recordings of fish, made when the reef was still thriving, to tempt the surviving fish into areas where they could establish new habitats. Another interviewee, who works with indigenous people in Canada, talked about “action feeling better than anxiety”. Can they – can we – stem the crisis?\nThree offbeat slices of satire\nThe Skewer\nJon Holmes, comedian and presenter, has a weirder side to him than you might think if you’ve just caught him on radio (he’s had various shows on the BBC, TalkRadio and Virgin). He started out with Chris Morris, and his new Radio 4 show is quite Morris-esque, featuring familiar people’s voices cut up and repasted into almost real conversations. The prime minister gets a remix, blasting Get Brexit Down to a dance beat. Trump’s backing is The Windmills of Your Mind… Nightmare, or dream? Funny and strange, like all good things.\nThe Bugle Presents… The Last Post\nThe Last Post offers more traditional satire than The Skewer. Aussie comic Alice Fraser (with a co-host, usually another comic such as Tiff Stevenson or Andy Zaltzman) chats through the main events of the day, including anniversaries, death-a-versaries, current international news and silly ads. Fraser zips through contemporary topics with impressive zeal and a clever script, to much cheeriness and chipping in from her co-host. Each episode is only about 15 minutes long, but absolutely packed. Like a sweary, sped-up News Quiz.\nThis City\nThis new podcast sees host Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo talk to various famous people about their connection to London. OK, this isn’t really satire, as you might have noticed. But…! Amfo’s first episode is an interview with the brilliant Mo The Comedian, aka Mo Gilligan, who can make anything and everything funny. Gilligan’s skits on contemporary life are second to none, and if you want a skew-whiff, yet on point, dissection of who and what we are in the UK today, he’s the one to turn to.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

We are a nation on the extremities, where climate change will affect and strip away what we love much sooner than will occur in Europe and North America.\nNo patriotic Australian can be anything but angry to read stories of a billion or more animals killed in the fires – especially when you realise the koalas on Kangaroo Island are chlamydia-free and are essentially the best protection against their extinction.\nOur wildlife is so exceptional and precious that the upset in balance that comes from climate change will render some habitats unliveable.\nTo read that the platypus is facing extinction due to human activity exacerbated by climate change should have every patriotic Australian filled with rage.\nConservative patriots love to talk up Australia “punching above its weight” on things such as sport or business or war, but they turn to self-hating cowards when it comes to climate change.\nYes, Australia “only” accounts for around 1.3% of emissions (of course well above what you would expect given our population), but given the fragility of our ecosystem, any political leaders who profess to love Australia should be energising our diplomatic networks and using every economic and political lever we have to cajole, convince and encourage other nations to act on climate change.\nWe should do this even if it is out of purely selfish reasons of loving our country and wanting it to remain in the same state that has caused that love.\nAustralian bushfires to contribute to huge annual increase in global carbon dioxide\nRead more\nIf you love Australia, climate change should scare the hell out of you because the reef, our rivers, our wildlife, our fresh air, even, as we have seen since December, our relaxed summer holidays are going to be stripped away from us.\nOur government has more reason than most others outside of the Pacific Islands to be demanding global action on climate change.\nGiven our wealth we should be leading the way – leading by example rather than leading to ruin as our current government has been at the most recent climate change conferences.\nWhat we love about Australia will be taken by climate change well before other nations who emit much more greenhouse gas will feel great changes.

She said the protection offered to species after they were listed should also be reconsidered as the existing model of recovery planning had not worked. Fewer than 40% of nationally threatened species have recovery plans in place.\nShe said she was encouraged by the level of goodwill between federal and state governments, scientists and conservationists following the fires, including the response by Sussan Ley, the federal environment minister, who has set up and met with an expert scientific panel to advise on what needed to be done.\nThe federal government has allocated $50m in wildlife recovery funding, with a promise of more to come, and officials from across fire affected areas are due to meet on Tuesday to continue work on a national response.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn Australian army trooper in the process of removing deceased wildlife from the Hanson wildlife sanctuary on Kangaroo Island.

She said it could include wildlife surveys.\n“I’ve been quite concerned about the way we monitor our biodiversity in Australia, it’s a huge job, and I think if we are going to understand the impact of fires that is a very interesting idea that needs consideration,” she said.\nGiven not everything could be monitored, she said there would need to be clear priorities that would likely be defined by the 12m hectare bushfires. But she said it was important to consider “biodiversity arks”, key areas that had avoided the fires, as well as burned country.\nMarsh said it should utilise technology, including remote sensing and drones, as well as on-ground field work by scientists, Indigenous rangers and possibly community groups and citizen scientists. “I do believe that the importance of monitoring the impact of the fires will be a catalyst for doing this work,” she said. “It is very important that it be well designed and scientifically robust.”\nLyrebird may join threatened species, as scale of bird habitat lost to bushfires emerges\nRead more\nWhile she backed the development of a national system, Marsh said monitoring the impact of the fires could not wait for a new system and needed to begin as soon as it was safe.\nAn analysis by environment groups found the Coalition had cut funding for environmental programs, monitoring and staff by about 40% since being elected in 2013.\nMarsh said changes would be needed to the national environment laws, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity and Protection Act, which is being reviewed by businessman Graeme Samuel.\nAsked how successful the laws had been, she said the government’s state of the environment report, which among other things found climate change was altering the structure and function of Australia’s natural ecosystems and affecting heritage, economic activity and human wellbeing, “spoke for itself”.\nMarsh said the review of the laws should consider whether it was appropriate to adopt more advanced criteria used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to assess whether an ecological community was threatened.\nGovernment ministers including Ley last year stressed the review would focus on cutting “green tape”. Scientists have expressed hope it may now address the impact of the fires and what was needed to avoiding an extinction crisis that scientists said was worsening before the devastating fire season.\nScientists last year said three native Australian species had become extinct in the past decade and another 17 could follow in the next 20 years. More than 1,800 Australian plants and animals are listed as threatened with extinction. Scientists warned in a letter to the government before the fires that this was likely to be an underestimate.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Instead, the biggest obstacles to creating change come in the form of those who profit from maintaining the system as it is, despite that system bringing little benefit to the country – either the people or the environment.\nThe benefit this system brings is purely measured in terms of profit for the few and, in the eyes of the profiteers at least, far outweighs any and all other concerns.\nAustralia is built on lies, so why would we be surprised about lies about climate change?\nLuke Pearson for IndigenousX\nRead more\nWaking up to a realisation that your political leaders may not actually have the best interests of the citizenry or the lands and waters we rely on at heart is a bitter pill for many to swallow. It can be hard to accept that their decisions are influenced more by lobby groups than by common sense or the greater good.\nMost Indigenous peoples are all too familiar with this reality, both in terms of promoting better management of land and water, and in dealing with the reality that governments do not have our best interests at heart.\nSome people have struggled to see a connection between Australia Day and the current concerns over Australia’s refusal to embrace climate change. The last Guardian article I wrote was met with countless people failing to understand how I could draw a connection to the colonial experiment that is Australia and the current situations that we find ourselves in.\nFor me, however, they are intrinsically linked.\nFor what single date better signifies all that is wrong with Australia than a country that blindly chooses to celebrate the worst of its own history? What date better paints a picture of a nation desperately clinging to an outdated colonial identity rather than embracing all that is special about the continent they now reside on and doing everything in its power to protect it? And indeed, what could be a better date to protest Australia’s inaction on climate change, inaction on Indigenous rights, inaction on putting the rights of the people in front of corporate interests?\nMany of us have abandoned the #Changethedate hashtag in favour of #Changethenation\nDespite conservative commentators wilfully pretending that opposition to Australia Day is solely about a date in the calendar, for at least the last 82 years since the first official Day of Mourning was held in Sydney, 26 January has provided a platform for Indigenous peoples to call for change. Be it in the form of self-determination, treaty, stopping Aboriginal deaths in custody, changing child removal practices, or any other number of issues.\nAustralia Day protests, whether they are operating under the name of Invasion Day, Survival Day or Day of Mourning, have always been about highlighting injustice and rallying support to worthy causes.\nIt is not simply a “White Australian v Indigenous peoples” issue, firstly because there’s lots of people living here who are neither, but also because there are millions of non-Indigenous people who support these calls for change and, to be fair to the other side, at least four Indigenous people who apparently want everything to stay how it is – probably more but conservative media only ever seem to bring out the same few for some reason.\nChange the Date has always been synonymous with Change the Nation, but as social media has brought this 80+ year-old debate into the mainstream, something seemed to have gotten lost in translation over the past few years, which is why many of us have abandoned the #Changethedate hashtag in favour of #Changethenation – to keep the conversation on track with what it has always been about.\nAll that has changed this year with the fire season is that it has brought home, for many, the realities of a possible apocalyptic near-future for Australia if we do not change.\nI no longer support #ChangeTheDate. We must change Australia\nLuke Pearson\nRead more\nUnderstanding how toxic patriotism has become in Australia is essential to this challenge.\nPatriotism that should be about a love of the land and people has become instead about a justification for bigotry and racism, about instilling hatred in the perceived “other”, and about providing a comfortable smokescreen for government looking after its own interests at the expense of the rest of us.\nThat is why 26 January, the ultimate day for toxic patriotism, has always been the prefect day to call for change, to rally for support, to highlight problems and offer solutions, and to come together and grow the movement of those who want to change the nation for the better, because the only other option is to continue to blindly support the same course of action, the same way of thinking, that got us into this mess in the first place.\nIndigenous peoples are not the problem, but we may well be Australia’s best hope for a solution.\n• Luke Pearson is the founder of IndigenousX\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

She questioned the removal on Twitter.\n“Why did you remove me from the photo? I was part of the group”, she tweeted in response. Other agencies, including Reuters, misidentified Nakate as Zambian activist Natasha Mwansa. Reuters’ currently available version of the photograph identifies the other four activists in the picture but not Nakate.\nDavid Ake, the AP’s director of photography, told Buzzfeed UK that, under tight deadline, the photographer “cropped it purely on composition grounds”.\nAdvertisement\n“He thought the building in the background was distracting,” Ake said.\nIn the viral video, Nakate elaborated on what she considers the erasure of black and brown voices in conversations surrounding climate change, pointing out that people who look like her are most vulnerable to rising global temperatures.\n“We don’t deserve this. Africa is the least emitter of carbons, but we are the most affected by the climate crisis,” she said. “You erasing our voices won’t change anything. You erasing our stories won’t change anything.”\nSupporters and fellow climate activists came to her defence, sparking a dialogue on racism within environmentalist spaces and the need for better focus on climate justice.\n“It’s disgraceful that not only is Africa ignored, it’s also deliberately removed from the picture,” Theo Cullen-Mouze, a 17-year-old Irish climate activist.\n“Africa has contributed the least, but will suffer the most from climate breakdown.

In 2010 Bob Dudley was the man tasked with steering the group back from the brink of collapse as compensation payouts threatened to suffocate the business.\nA decade on, Dudley’s successor will now have to navigate an environmental crisis on a global scale.\nBernard Looney becomes BP’s new chief executive next month at a time of mounting public pressure to prevent a climate breakdown by phasing out fossil fuels. His career success has been built on the millions of barrels of oil that BP produces every day, but his tenure at the helm will be defined by his response to the climate crisis.\nAdvertisement\nThe dapper, 49-year-old Irishman has been hailed as a charismatic moderniser of the oil industry for the millennial generation. This week he launched an Instagram account to encourage a “candid” conversation about the energy transition. Many believe this unconventional oil man may be BP’s best hope of surviving the global shift from fossil fuels. Sources within the company say Looney was the natural frontrunner in the race to take over from Dudley.\n“It was no surprise to me whatsoever,” says one. “This is a business which needs to continue to deliver on its promises to shareholders, but must also evolve. The new leader will need to do both, and for many Bernard was the natural choice.”\nSo, how “green” is BP’s new chief executive? “It’s a legitimate question,” says Mark Lewis, head of sustainability at the asset management arm of French investment bank BNP Paribas. “The burden of truth will rest firmly on his shoulders.”\nHe adds: “In Europe’s financial centres the sense is that BP may be the European major with the most work to do in terms of improving their reputation and performance on climate change. I think Mr Looney will find that this is the first and most important question that he will need to give reassurance on.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBP’s Valhall platform in the Norwegian North Sea. Photograph: BP / KJETIL ALSVIK / HANDOUT/EPA\nLooney is a BP “lifer”. He was marked as a rising star soon after joining as an engineering graduate from University College Dublin, and primed for senior leadership. A series of plum apprentice roles beside BP bosses followed, including stints working directly for John Browne and Tony Hayward.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWhen Dudley took the reins in 2010 he promoted Looney to BP’s senior management team. Looney later became the global boss of “upstream” oil and gas production, where he was in charge of reigniting the company’s fossil fuel growth.\nUnder his leadership BP produced 2.6 million barrels of oil and gas every day, and secured a series of multibillion-dollar investments that will pour millions more barrels into the global market in the years ahead.\nMark van Baal, from the Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This, warns that a career steeped in oil reserves may make it difficult for Looney to “imagine a future beyond oil and gas” or see renewables “as a business opportunity not a chore”.\nHowever, Nick Boyle, the chief executive of BP’s solar joint venture Lightsource BP, says he has “absolutely no doubt” about BP’s commitment to developing renewable energy. Boyle teamed up with BP two years ago and has met Looney twice in recent months.\n“He was genuinely interested and asking intelligent questions about challenges and what we thought the future would be for solar. We know from any of the energy projections available that solar is going to play an ever increasing part in the energy mix, and part of BP,” he says.\nStill, the oil bosses who have led the most meaningful climate action have tended to be new arrivals to the industry. The Danish energy giant Orsted has traded oil rigs for offshore windfarms under the leadership of Henrik Poulsen, a former telecoms boss who was once an executive at Lego. Spain’s Repsol set out industry-leading plans to emerge as a carbon- neutral company by 2050, mapped by its chief executive, Josu Jon Imaz, after a career in politics and scientific academia.\nLooney intends to be the exception. In an industry speech shortly before he was named as BP’s new boss, he told delegates: “We need to listen, hard, to society’s concerns. They are real concerns – the world is not on a sustainable path – and they are our concerns. Shouting louder about the good that we do is not a winning strategy. We need to demonstrate that we are part of the solution – that we get it.”\nHe is reportedly poised to unveil the biggest strategic overhaul of the company’s century-long history. According to Reuters, the plan is to broaden BP’s carbon targets beyond the emissions it produces within its operations to include the emissions from the product it sells to customers.\nEnvironmental campaigners believe this would be a crucial step, an essential means of pushing oil companies into providing cleaner sources of energy.\n“Maybe it’s the Irish thing,” Boyle adds. “But he instils a confidence and a positive, can-do mentality which is infectious. It’s a big company, but he’s always been well-known as a charismatic, lead-from-the-front, roll-your-sleeves-up type of guy. The big plus with Bernard is that he gets it.”\nBP’s chances of surviving beyond its next environmental crisis will depend on that.\nKey demands\nActivist investors say oil firms must:\nCut their own emissions\nOil companies can do a lot to reduce CO2 emitted during production – by, for example, cutting methane leaks from rigs and stopping “flaring” – the burning of “waste” gas from oilfields.\nTake responsibility for the carbon footprint of the energy they sell\nOutgoing boss Bob Dudley stated that BP “cannot control” how people choose to drive or heat their homes, but setting an emissions target for the energy they produce should help a shift towards clean sources.\nSet a clear strategy for hitting the Paris climate goals\nTo achieve net zero emissions by 2050, oil companies also need to invest in measures such as tree planting and carbon capture.\nLink executive pay to climate action\nThis would incentivise leaders and guard against “greenwash” promises.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They’re planning widespread voter activation in the 2020 US presidential election as well as direct action targeting the fossil fuel industry and the banks and politicians that enable it.\n“The headline message of the strikes in 2020 is: the kids are taking to the streets to strike for climate and they’re asking you to vote,” said Katie Eder, the executive director of Future Coalition, a communications and training hub for youth climate groups.\nThere are more than 300 organizations involved in the efforts, Eder said, including some of the largest youth and adult coalitions in climate movement: Fridays for Future, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Zero Hour, Extinction Rebellion.\n“We’re starting to have the conversation within the strikes about how we’re balancing both the political targets and the financial targets,” Eder said, calling power and money “really key to the root causes of why we’re not addressing climate change”.\nActivists have planned widespread voter mobilization campaigns; three days of national strikes, marches, and direct action against politicians and banks beginning on Earth Day (22 April); regular strikes on Fridays and additional strikes targeting primary elections in every state; plus an international day of action, college divestment campaigns, and a huge push by the Sunrise Movement to turn out the vote for Bernie Sanders and a Green New Deal.\nStories of climate awakening are a universal truth for young Americans living in the age of worsening climate conditions. Isabella Fallahi, who has asthma, for example, has lived within 14 miles of a coal-burning generating facility all of her life.\n“A lot of people don’t think of Indiana, or the midwest, for that matter, as frontline communities,” she said. “We face the silent killers. The terrible air quality because of mining projects, the terrible water quality because of mining projects, the health effects associated with both of those, droughts that cripple the agricultural economies that we’re based off of.”\nGreta Thunberg: Davos leaders ignored climate activists' demands\nRead more\nBut Fallahi, like many other young organizers, is also galvanized by the tech proficiency of her generation, born into the era of hashtags and the ubiquitous touchscreen. She was a speaker at the UN climate change conference in Madrid (COP 25) in December 2019, when she and other youth were nearly ejected for protesting against the fossil fuel executives on panels and in negotiations.\nApproximately 200 young people in 40 countries, many of whom were at the conference, organized a response called Polluters Out. In 20 days, they had a website, a multilingual launch video, a press release in seven languages, and a list of demands. In actions set for March, they will call for the exclusion of fossil fuel interests at COP26 and transparency in the UN framework on climate change, as well as inclusion of indigenous and human rights in the Paris agreement. Regional efforts in the US will also call for a Green New Deal, a halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure, divestments from fossil fuels by universities and campaign funds, and the targeting of specific banks for fossil fuel investments.\nThe groups stay in touch through conference calls, Slack, Zoom, and Google Drive. Activists in Cuba – who can’t download the apps because of the US trade embargo – tune in through WhatsApp. There’s a Slack channel for supporting scientists, too. And meetings wait for organizers in the Amazon who need to travel to towns for internet access.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA scene from Long Beach, California, during the global climate strikes in September 2019.

That is how Naina Agrawal-Hardin ended up in the guidance office at Washtenaw high school outside Ann Arbor, Michigan, for an interview. She’s a leader for the Ann Arbor hub of the Sunrise Movement. And she’s 16, a junior. Her school, she said, was supportive.\n“Whenever I have to take conference calls or interviews during school hours, they usually will write me a pass to get out of class,” she said.\nAgrawal-Hardin is planning a watch party at her home – a sneak peek at the forthcoming documentary Generation Green New Deal and a video about the Sunrise Movement’s 2020 campaign, as part of its annual kickoff. Sunrise provides the documentaries, discussion questions, and near-daily training on organizing and recruitment techniques. When Agrawal-Hardin hosts her event on 29 January, she’ll be one of more than 2,000 hosts nationwide.\nThrough 2020, the Sunrise Movement will similarly activate its 300 chapters in support of Bernie Sanders, leveraging 10,000 volunteers in most of the 50 states for door knocks, voting pledges and climate education. Sunrise endorsed Sanders as the best-positioned candidate to lead a Green New Deal and address income inequality.\n“By primary/caucus day in Iowa and New Hampshire, we are going to have over 20,000 young people who have signed pledges to vote for Green New Deal champions” in the two states, said Sofie Karasek, a Sunrise Movement spokesperson. “What we’re really expecting to see in 2020 is Young Green New Deal voters really become the margin of victory for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Greta Thunberg and Prince Charles have given stark speeches warning of the dangers of a warming world, and CEOs and presidents have promised long overdue action.\nWhat did we learn from Davos 2020?\nRead more\nFor those of us in the climate movement, this shift of focus is no surprise. Last year changed everything. From the wave of schoolchildren going on climate strike, to large scale non-violent uprisings like Extinction Rebellion, 2019 proved to be the year that people in power couldn’t hide any more from the need to act. And then Australia caught fire: no amount of money could put those fires out.\nWith this sudden focus on climate it’s no wonder that attendees of the WEF have come under fire for their choice of transport in getting there. Prince Charles flew to the summit in a private jet, before demanding new green taxes. And he wasn’t the only one. Figures from last year suggest over 300 private jets landed for the talks – somewhat overshadowing the summit’s eco-credentials, including the carpets made from “end-of-life fishing nets” and the rooms painted with renewable resources “like seaweed”. But though the egregious use of private jets is both deeply hypocritical and climate-wrecking, it shouldn’t be the main focus of our ire.\nInstead, let’s look at what those sitting around this year’s mountaintop tables have on their climate record. And let’s be real about how much big corporates can plan for a carbon-free future, in light of the fact that just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. Just 20 companies have contributed to 480bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965 – that’s a third of all emissions. Many of them – including the two largest emitters on Earth – are listed as “affiliates” on the WEF website. And it’s not just big oil – the financial institutions participating in the WEF are responsible for pumping at least $1.4tn into fossil fuel investments since the Paris climate agreement was signed.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Greta Thunberg and Prince Charles have given stark speeches – warning of the dangers of a warming world.’ Photograph: AP\nAnd then there’s the governments. Prince Charles’ speech was a powerful challenge to those in power, asking if “we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink?” But the UK government was this week revealed to be supporting fossil fuel mega projects around the world with the combined emissions of a country the size of Portugal.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nSuch climate failure is not a byproduct of the economic system advocated by the WEF, it is baked into their model. An ideological commitment to free markets – advocated by those at Davos every year for the summit’s 50-year history – has been a consistent block to progress on the climate crisis. Just look at the world emissions data – an endless pursuit of economic expansion, of marketising every aspect of our lives, of extracting oil and gas to the point of no return, has put us on course for climate catastrophe. Climate data isn’t, as Thunberg says, “anyone’s political opinions or views”: it’s just a statement of fact.\nAnd that’s why over the last week I trekked across the mountains to Davos. Alongside 1500 people I spent three days walking from Landquart to Davos in possibly the coldest and most high-altitude climate justice march of all time. On the final day, we even managed to block the road to Davos, which has been blocking progress for a fairer and more just world the past 50 years.\nWhile Australia is burning and frontline communities all over the world are threatened by the very real consequences of the climate crisis, Davos-style meetings will never give us the answers we need. In truth, it would be foolish for anyone to expect a private club whose 1000 member companies have paid between 60,000 to 600,000 swiss francs to be a member (the more you pay the more access you have) should be trusted to solve an issue they created.\nDavos is still a mystery to me – nothing much ever seems to get done\nJohn Crace\nRead more\nA crisis of this scale needs scalable and just solutions – whether that’s a Green New Deal, divestment from fossil fuels, or decarbonisation targets in richer countries being rapidly brought forward.

Skea said the UK had many advantages over other countries in CCS, such as spent oilfields in the North Sea to use as storage, the skills and infrastructure from oil and gas exploration, and public backing for the technology, but needed the government to step in.\nCorinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at UEA, called for the government to prioritise the net zero goal across all policy areas.\n“Every minister should have a plan for their own [policy area] on how to reach net zero,” she said. “Some infrastructure must be phased out. Ministers should be preparing in a way that is well coordinated and fair, so that the public are brought on board.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nNo part of government, and no part of the economy and society, could be left unaffected if the push towards net zero was to be successful, said Skea. “We really need to do it all,” he said. “Nothing can be wiped off the table. No sector can be left to not contribute – really, this needs contributions from absolutely everything.”\nThere is no cabinet minister with responsibility for achieving the net zero target, and no intermediate goals before 2050, apart from the advice on carbon budgets from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s statutory advisors.\nOn Thursday, the CCC called for major changes to the UK’s land use, including more trees, the restoration of peatland and an end to the burning of grouse moors, to improve the UK’s carbon sinks.\nThe expansion of Heathrow, which was given a green light under Theresa May, was not consistent with the net zero goals, a group of six experts said on Friday.\n“I find it difficult to imagine we can control emissions from aviation if we continue to build airports,” said Le Quéré. “We absolutely need ambitious plans for mobility and transport. We need a plan that covers roads and airports.”\nPierre Friedlingstein, professor of mathematical modelling of climate systems at Exeter University, said: “This is a clear example of not going in the right direction.”\nWilson said: “We desperately need consistent, concerted direction [from the government] and building new airport capacity is not that.”\nSkea said it was possible for people to continue taking flights under a net zero target, but that the rapid growth of flying in recent years must be curtailed. “It’s not that people must stop flying, but that the increase in flying should be less than it otherwise would be,” he said.\nOne way of achieving this fairly would be through a frequent flyer levy, according to Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University. “The sense that it is a fair policy is very important,” she said. “These policy interventions are likely to be quite effective.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But while many delegates spoke about the importance of climate issues, actual action was harder to find.\nGreta Thunberg tells world leaders to end fossil fuel ‘madness’\nRead more\nLuisa Neubauer, a 23-year-old German climate activist, said she had met the chief executive of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, at Davos this week to press him to abandon a contract to supply rail signalling to a mine in Australia.\nThe Adani project would be one of the world’s largest coalmines, and Neubauer said such fossil fuel activity needed to be curbed by companies and investors. Otherwise the Paris agreement’s goal of keeping global heating to 2C this year could not be met, she said.\nQuick guide\nWhat is Davos 2020?\nShow\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\n“If you add up all the contracts that have been signed by today on fossil fuel projects, we will be far beyond 2C,” said Neubauer. “Some of those contracts, if not all of them, will have to be cancelled if we want to actually do something about Paris.\n“This is not a radical demand, this is a rational demand,” she added.\nOn Thursday, the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said climate activists should recognise the impact of fossil fuel divestment on jobs, and said Thunberg should go study economics before offering advice.\nThunberg said such barbs, like Donald Trump’s criticism, had no effect on her.\n“We are being criticised like that all the time. If we cared about that, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do,” she said, before leading a Fridays for Future protest in the ski resort.\nPlay Video\n2:00\nDonald Trump on Greta Thunberg: 'She beat me out on Time magazine' – video\nSome climate actions were announced at Davos, including a push to plant 1tn trees, which Donald Trump backed.\nAdvertisement\nThunberg warned earlier this week that planting trees was not enough to tackle the climate crisis. But Micah White, the co-founder of the Occupy Wall Street movement, said the trillion tree campaign would work as a Trojan horse to help mobilise people to fight the climate emergency.\n“I love the trillion tree campaign, because hundreds of millions of people will need to be mobilised at the grass roots,” he said on the sidelines of WEF. “To actually mobilise that number of people, and plant that number of trees, will be such a systemic disruption of our day-to-day lives that it will be revolutionary.”\nWhite said corporations would have to tell staff, “You don’t have to come into work this week, we’re all planting trees”, and governments will have to deposit trees in all the schools, to actually carry out the plan.\nWhite attended Davos with a manifesto titled “An Alliance Of Opposites”. It proposed that protest movements, governments, activists, industry, and civil society could work together on the climate emergency.\nMicah White, PhD\n(@beingMicahWhite)\nTHIS IS WHAT I SAID TO ELITES AT DAVOS\nIt was a surreal experience to hand this candidly written activist manifesto to a few of the world’s most powerful people at the World Economic Forum in @Davos. https://t.co/dmuwyU0NJP#WEF2020\nJanuary 24, 2020\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

So what did we learn from the 50th gathering?\nFor some, the penny has dropped about the climate emergency\nThis was the “global heating Davos”, with session after session devoted to the topic. For Mark Carney, in his last weeks as governor of the Bank of England before stepping down, the story was not the near unanimity among policymakers, but that the financial sector – including the big banks of Wall Street – now understands the investment risk of global heating and is starting to adjust its behaviour accordingly.\nThe past year has turned Greta Thunberg from a Davos curiosity into a household name and global force\nAt the start of the 2019 Davos, Thunberg was a 16-year-old Swedish student going on strike from school to protest against the lack of action on global heating. She electrified last year’s WEF and was even bigger news this time, going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and members of his cabinet, and getting the better of the exchanges. Most seasoned Davos hands thought Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, had blundered when he said he would only start listening to Thunberg when she had a degree in economics.\nQuick guide\nWhat is Davos 2020?\nShow\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum.

Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\nDavos has a love-hate relationship with Trump\nFor the second time in three years, Trump turned up at the annual festival of globalisation – more visits than Bill Clinton and Barack Obama managed between them in the combined 16 years of their presidencies. The chief executives of the multinationals that flock to Davos find Trump strangely compelling in spite of his anti-globalist views. He was comfortably the biggest draw of the week. There were a few titters as Trump boasted of the economic miracle he has created in the US, but privately American big business likes tax cuts, likes deregulation and would rather have him in the White House than any Democrat.\nThe mood among the UK business community is more upbeat following the election\nAdvertisement\nIt would be wrong to imagine that UK plc is jumping for joy that Britain is leaving the EU at the end of next week, but there is a sense of relief that much of the uncertainty is over. A year ago, when Theresa May was struggling vainly to get her withdrawal bill through parliament, businesses were putting investment on hold because they were in the dark about how Brexit would unfold. Following last month’s general election, some of the projects that were mothballed have been given the go-ahead. The global economy may also have bottomed out.\nThere wasn’t much of a UK presence\nAlong with Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson decided that hobnobbing with people Theresa May once called the citizens of nowhere was not the best political look. At one time it looked as if there would be no UK cabinet minister in Davos, but in the end Sajid Javid was left to fly the flag. There were plenty of ex-ministers around though: the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, the former prime minister Gordon Brown and the former chancellor George Osborne among them. May also did a turn to the citizens of nowhere at a PwC drinks reception.\nThe cybersecurity threat got personal, but Davos didn’t want to talk about it\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nOn the first day of Davos, the Guardian broke the story that the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, had apparently been hacked by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. Cybersecurity is always on the agenda and there was a personal twist this year, because many of those attending Davos came into contact with Prince Mohammed on the trip when he met Bezos and maybe also exchanged mobile phone numbers with him. The Guardian tracked down three of them: Mnuchin; the Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and the Microsoft boss, Satya Nadella. However, despite their public commitments to openness and transparency, none was prepared to talk about it.\nA sombre Davos had its amusing moments\nThere wasn’t an awful lot to laugh about in Davos, what with the backdrop of global heating, cyber-threats, and the coronavirus. But there were the odd moments of levity. Trump provided one of them, albeit unwittingly, with his claim that the US was enjoying a “boom the likes of which the world has never seen”. That would only be true if American history began on the day he was elected president. Javid provided one of the others. Pressing the flesh at a CBI lunch, he was asked by one business leader: “Who are you?” Not realising he was being teased, a visibly taken aback Javid replied: “I’m the chancellor.”\nPlanes, trains and automobiles\nDavos says it gets the existential threat of the climate crisis, but does it really? Prince Charles flew to Switzerland by private jet, before switching to an electric car to give the WEF the benefit of his wisdom on how to save the planet. One delegate, kept waiting in the cold while Trump was being whisked from the conference centre to his hotel, tried to count the number of cars in the president’s motorcade and wasn’t quite sure whether there were 37 or 39. The WEF says most attendees arrived by train and that the Zurich group will plant 13,000 trees: one for every one of the bright blue bobble hats it has handed out for free.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The proposed building must meet the performance of the notional design to pass the test.\nCritically, the new changes to the regulations would remove something called the Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard, meaning a building designed next year could be allowed to perform much worse than one built in 2013, when the current standards were introduced. Similarly, a building that would fail to meet the current regulations would pass under the new system. Part L applies to all buildings, although the current consultation covers only dwellings.\nSecondly, Leti warns that a proposed emphasis on overall carbon footprint will help to mask the actual energy performance of new homes. The government intends to introduce a new factor into the assessment, related to the energy efficiency of the grid, not the building itself. Because the National Grid has been rapidly decarbonising over the last few years, as more renewables have been connected, the new method of assessment would show that a home produced lower carbon emissions than before – despite the design being exactly the same.\n“The new proposals totally mask the actual energy efficiency of a home,” says Clare Murray, head of sustainability at architecture firm Levitt Bernstein and member of Leti. “They make the building look like it is performing better, when the reality is it could be much worse.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAt a time when the built environment accounts for 40% of UK carbon emissions, a growing number of architects, engineers, planners and developers are demanding urgent change to the regulations to insist on more stringent energy standards. The proposed reforms of Part L are a missed opportunity to properly address the climate emergency, they say.\n“It’s a massive disappointment,” says Joe Giddings, co-founder of the Architects Climate Action Network (Acan), a campaign group formed last year to address the twin crises of climate and ecological breakdown. “From disregarding the performance of a building’s fabric to ignoring the embodied energy of materials, the proposals represent a total loosening of regulations. And it’s all hidden in a dense consultation document that seems designed to confuse.”\nBoth Leti and Acan have also criticised proposals to remove local authorities’ existing powers to insist on greater energy efficiency than the national building regulations demand. Around 65% of local authorities have declared a climate emergency, and many have already introduced more stringent energy standards into the planning process, but all this would be overwritten by the new lower national regulations.\n“Not only are the building regulations going backwards,” says Murray, “but local authorities won’t be able to set their own rules appropriate to their areas. It will roll the whole country backwards.”\nLeti wants to see a fundamental shift towards monitoring how buildings actually perform in use, away from the current system of simply measuring abstract design factors in a vacuum, before the dwelling is built. Their research has shown that many buildings don’t come anywhere near meeting their purported Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band, the official rating of a property’s energy efficiency. Equally, the way the rating system calculates heat loss and gain means it can’t detect factors such as more insulation and better airtightness, so good buildings end up being rated lower than they should be.\n“The current system is simply not fit for purpose,” says Bagenal George. “It’s the wrong set of tools, as it was never designed to achieve net zero carbon.” The UK has a legal commitment to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, but Leti believes the new building regulations will knock it hopelessly off course. It is urging people to respond to the consultation on Part L by the 7 February deadline. On Monday, it will launch its own 150-page Climate Emergency Design Guide, along with an equally hefty Embodied Carbon Primer, which it hopes will provide practical solutions for architects, clients and local authorities to achieve a zero-carbon future.\n“At the moment, our regulations simply aim for a ‘percentage better than bad’,” says Bagenal George. “We want to redefine what ‘good’ looks like and set out how we can get there.”\n• This article was amended on 27 January 2020.

That is a tax on hardworking people.”\nMnuchin said technology would provide the solution to reducing carbon emissions and that the costs of action would be lower in 10 years time.\n“Environmental issues have an impact on the economy but it is one of many important issues.”\nQuick guide\nDonald Trump's five most dangerous attacks on the environment\nShow\nDeparture from the Paris climate agreement\nIn June 2017 Trump announced his plan to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement saying\" “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”. He claimed the agreement promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep global heating below 2C, unfairly disadvantaged the US and negatively impacted jobs and factories.\nShrinking national monuments and animal protections\nIn December 2017 Trump announced plans to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah.

In late 2018 the administration then announced plans to remove key provisions from the Endangered Species Act – prompting conservationists to warn it could put vulnerable plant and animal species in more danger.\nRollback of the Clean Power Plan\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of finalizing plans to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule intended to cut emissions from power plants and encourage them to move towards natural gas and renewable power.\nCuts to clean water protections\nThe Trump administration plans to remove protections from thousands of America’s streams and millions of acres of wetlands, which is feared will harm wildlife and enable pollution to enter drinking water. Currently, protected waterways provide drinking water to approximately 117 million people.\nMore methane\nIn September 2018, the Trump administration announced its plans to repeal rules that aim to restrict methane leaks on public and tribal lands. The Obama administration tried to cut leaks by forcing oil and gas companies to capture methane (a key gas involved in global heating), but Trump's Department of the Interior has branded the rule 'flawed' and 'unnecessarily burdensome on the private sector'.\nMiranda Bryant\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nMnuchin cited the Coronavirus health emergency, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the possibility of oil prices hitting $120 (£92) a barrel, and the need to power development in poor countries as other problems that policy makers needed to be concerned about.\n“There are way too many people in the developing world who don’t have access to electricity. We need to create an environment where they have better lives,” he said.\nMnuchin found himself in a minority of one on a panel that included the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, and the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, as well as Lagarde and Scholz.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nGeorgieva said the investments that would be needed to transform economies could be the “silver bullet” that would lift the world economy from four lows: low productivity, low growth, low inflation and low interest rates.\n“We need to think of policies that are good for the economy, good for the environment and good for people” she said. Green investment could provide a use for the world’s big pool of unused savings. “Not everything is doom and gloom.”\nLagarde said that pricing the cost of making the transition to a low carbon economy coupled with pressure on companies to disclose their exposure to climate crisis risk would persuade companies to move faster.\nThe ECB head said that, according to the marketing industry, there were three things that made people move: sex, fear and greed.\n“I don’t want to talk about the first but the fear factor is there. Look at the complete disasters that are going on around the world.”\nTurning to greed, Lagarde said the recent announcement from Larry Fink, the executive director of BlackRock, that the world’s biggest asset manager was moving to sustainable investment was an indication that companies were starting to worry about the impact of the climate emergency on their bottom line.\nScholz said Germany’s decision to pay out more than €40bn to coalmining regions and power companies to phase out coal plants was justified by the scale of the threat. “There is climate change and it will hurt us. It will have negative effects on the economy.\nBritain’s departure from the EU next week had not entirely lifted the threat from Brexit, Lagarde said, noting that the negotiations this year over the new EU-UK trading arrangement had the potential to cause trouble.\n“Brexit is a little bit less uncertain, but we still have that possible cliff edge in December of 2020. We don’t’ know exactly what the trade relationship will be. And it’s a big partner for the euro area, so that’s certainly a question mark.”\nScholz expressed relief that there had not been a “hard Brexit” and predicted that Germany would not take an economic hit from Britain’s departure.\n“It will be more difficult for the UK because it needs its business model to be reorganised” Scholz said. He added that the City of London would be affected by Brexit.\n“I think we will find solutions”, Scholz said, while warning the UK that there might not be a “special, competitive advantage of being outside” the EU.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A paper submitted to the synod says all parts of the church must take action or “ramp up what they are already doing”.\nQuick guide\nWhat is the General Synod and what does it do?\nShow\nFirst meeting in its current format in 1970, the General Synod of the Church of England sets the rules and legislation for the running of the church. There are usually two or three synodical sessions per year, which are officially opened by the monarch.\nWho is on the General Synod?\nThe synod has three houses and there are currently 467 members.\nThe House of Bishops consists of all 42 bishops in the Church of England. They are joined by nine suffragan bishops.\nThe House of Clergy comprises ordained church members below the rank of bishop. They are elected every five years by their fellow clergy to represent their individual Dioceses.\nThe House of Laity comprises of unordained members of the church who are indirectly elected every 5 years. Each diocese is represented by two members.\nWhat does the General Synod do?\nThe main functions of the General Synod are to pass measures dealing with the government of the church and its institutions, and to pass canons, which determine doctrine and the permitted forms of worship.\nWas this helpful?\nThe church must “begin by getting our own house in order”, and although the paper says there are excellent initiatives, “the overall picture remains patchy”.\nIt gives examples such as switching to LED lighting, moving away from gas and oil to green electricity as the source of heat, using electric rather than petrol or diesel vehicles, and encouraging biodiversity in churchyards and glebe land.\n“We would need to think about our international travel, recognising that there are very strong connections with the rest of the world but also developing ways of nurturing those relationships which are more sustainable, and offsetting flights when necessary,” it says.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe church is committed is to reduce its carbon footprint by 80% within 30 years. Holtam acknowledged that some dioceses would like “us to go faster [than net zero by 2045], but we have got to travel together as a church, and set realistic targets”.\nHe said the environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion had been “brilliant” at forcing the climate crisis on to the global agenda.\n“The Church of England has buildings in every architectural style and material from the past 1,500 years, posing some unique challenges when it comes to energy efficiency,” he said.\n“However, churches are not museums; they are living buildings which serve their communities every day of the week, and being greener isn’t about doing less, it’s about equipping parishes to get smarter about energy consumption.\n“Setting a net zero target of 2045, five years ahead of the government’s target, would nonetheless represent a significant statement of intent by General Synod, one which will require innovation, faith and dedication from our churches, schools, and communities.\n“Christians are called to safeguard God’s creation and sustain and renew the life of the Earth. Faced with the reality of catastrophic climate change, which will affect the world’s most vulnerable people the soonest, radical and immediate action is our only option.”\nHowever, Christian Aid said the C of E should go further, pointing out that the National Farmers’ Union is planning for its entire sector to be net zero by 2040, and the UK water industry by 2030.\n“On matters of morality and injustice, the church should be at the forefront, modelling a prophetic vision that gives hope to the poor and voiceless,” said Patrick Watt, the charity’s director of policy and public affairs. “People suffering at the hands of the climate crisis in the global south, including millions of Christian sisters and brothers, need institutions in the rich world to move rapidly to cut emissions.”\nThe synod motion requests progress reports every three years.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Unlike natural gas, when hydrogen is burned it produces heat and water as opposed to carbon dioxide.\n“Heat hasn’t been particularly decarbonised to date and it’s a very big challenge,” said Lorna Millington, the future networks manager at Cadent, the gas distribution network that led the £7m HyDeploy project. “The aim was to turn the theoretical evidence into something real and tangible that the consumers within the Keele network are now getting to experience every day.”\nHow Orkney leads the way for sustainable energy\nRead more\nHeating homes and businesses accounts for half of the UK’s energy consumption and a third of its carbon dioxide emissions. Rolling the 20% hydrogen blend out across the country could save about 6m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, the equivalent of taking 2.5m cars off the road.\nThe hydrogen is captured using an electrolyser, which runs electricity through water to split it back into hydrogen and oxygen. This can then be injected into existing modern gas networks, with no need for customers to change appliances or pipework.\nThe Health and Safety Executive granted the project exemption in 2018 from the current 0.1% limit on hydrogen in the UK gas network after an extensive examination of evidence to ensure it would be safe. Keele University was identified as an ideal location, because it owns and operates a private gas network that can be isolated from the main network.\nAdvertisement\nTwo years of preparation involved gas safety checks on all buildings in the trial, laboratory tests on gas appliances and research on the effect of hydrogen on materials found in the gas network.\nAll appliances sold after 1996 must be able to sustain 23% hydrogen under current regulations. “The materials we use in our network are actually more than capable of dealing with the levels of hydrogen that we were looking at,” said Millington.\nThe trial will run until July and if successful a pilot will be rolled out in the north-east to deliver the 20% hydrogen blend to 670 domestic and commercial properties in Winlaton, Gateshead.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMark Horsley, the chief executive officer at Northern Gas Networks, said: “We’re really excited about the opportunity. There is a strong groundswell for decarbonisation, and I think opportunities for each individual home to contribute to that is quite powerful.”\nThe pilot, the first of its kind in the UK, would start in December and run for 10 months. Customers have already been notified about the upcoming change. “Early indications are that it’s going to be very positively received,” said Horsley.\nThe project is part of global exploration into the potentials of a “hydrogen economy”, in which the gas could also be used to generate electricity and produce heat with benefits for transport, heavy industry and domestic energy use.\nThe energy needed to produce hydrogen from water can be provided by solar, hydro or wind power to produce “green hydrogen”, but there are challenges in doing so at scale.\nIt still may be some time before the technology can be rolled out nationally, but “the 20% is a massive step forward for us as an industry and for the UK in achieving that net zero goal”, Horsley said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They counted floods and storms that would affect 1,000 people or kill 100 people.\nBroadly, the researchers also see governments around the world as critically unprepared.

Risks are highest for countries that are already seeing far more extreme events than the global average.\nClimate crisis linked to at least 15 $1bn-plus disasters in 2019\nRead more\nThe study is published in the peer-reviewed Climate, Disaster and Development Journal.\nCo-author Vinod Thomas, a visiting professor at the Asian Institute of Management in Manila who has held senior posts at the World Bank, said policymakers for the most part do not yet incorporate climate effects into their preparedness efforts.\n“On the one side, there needs to be climate adaptation efforts, such as relocating people from highly exposed coastal regions or building better disaster preparedness that would withstand extreme hurricanes,” Thomas said. “Equally, there is a strong case for stepping up climate change mitigation in decarbonizing their economies.”\nThomas said the findings of an “unmistakable causal link between carbon emissions and more intense floods and storms come at a crucial time,” as forest fires burn through Australia and floods and powerful storms hit the US and Europe.\nHe said countries like Thailand, which saw massive flooding events that killed hundreds and affected millions in 2011, could not handle twice as many catastrophes each year. He said they need to conduct stress tests to understand what they can withstand.\nThe study examined how disasters have increased as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the atmosphere over 60 years.

The official UK government statement on the summit and a press release failed to mention these, citing only the far smaller support for clean energy. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the “hypocrisy of the government’s position is breath-taking”.\nJohnson also announced that UK taxpayers’ money would no longer support overseas coal-fired power plants and coal mining. Yet MPs on the environmental select committee reported in 2019 that “UK Export Finance (UKEF) has not supported a coal project since 2002”.\nA report by Greenpeace and Newsnight also found that UKEF spent billions of pounds abroad supporting fossil fuel projects that will emit an estimated 69 million tonnes of carbon a year.\nThe UK will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November, at which nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3o-4oC rise in global temperatures.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe five oil and gas deals announced after the summit are worth £2.1bn, led by oil company Tullow investing £1.2bn in continued oil production in Kenya. The other fossil fuel contracts span the continent from Nigeria to Mozambique and Tunisia to Cote D’Ivoire. In contrast, just £161m in deals – 8% of the total – were related to clean energy, the biggest being for £80m of solar-powered irrigation pumps for Uganda and £50m to help build a solar farm in Kenya.\nBefore the summit, Lucas asked ministers which companies would attend, but the Department of Trade refused to reveal the names, citing “commercial interests”.\n“Now we know why the government was so secretive,” said Lucas. “The hypocrisy of the government’s position is breathtaking. It boasts of its green credentials one minute, and then hosts an investment summit which sees billions being invested in carbon-intensive industries in Africa. This government’s promises on climate action are completely hollow.\n“As hosts of this year’s UN climate summit, the UK needs to show international leadership and bring other countries with us.

Despite this progress – household food waste has fallen by 6%, from 7.1m tonnes to 6.6m tonnes over three years – the volume of food still wasted equates to 10bn edible meals, it points out. Household food waste represents 70% of all food waste triggered after the food has been grown or produced, with potatoes the single most wasted food.\nMarcus Gover, chief executive of WRAP, said: “We are in a new decade and have just 10 years if we are to honour our international commitment to halve food waste. This really matters because it is untenable that we carry on wasting food on such a monumental scale when we are seeing the visible effects of climate change every day, and when nearly a billion people go hungry every day.\n“This means we are starting to wake up to the reality of food waste, but we are too often turning a blind eye to what is happening in our homes. We are all thinking about what we can do for the environment and this is one of the most simple and powerful ways we can play our part. By wasting less food, we are helping to tackle the biggest challenges this century – feeding the world while protecting our planet.”\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nA reduction of 4% in the supply chain suggests progress from businesses, but WRAP says they must step up their action on food waste to help meet the UN target of halving global food waste by 2030. In the retail sector, waste rose by 6% compared with three years earlier, and in the restaurant sector it was up by 7%.\nTrewin Restorick, chief executive of environmental charity Hubbub, said: “If food waste was a country, it would be the world’s third biggest contributor to climate change. To hit our climate targets, improvement needs to be a launchpad for transformational change. This can only be achieved by increasing the culinary skills of households, building greater awareness of the environmental impact of food waste, and creating a consistent nationwide food recycling system.”\nClare Oxborrow, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government needs to set legally binding food waste reduction targets, and have food businesses report publicly on progress. The solutions are there – they just need to bring them into action.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It is a 2.74ppm increase above the 2019 average.\nScience agencies have associated concentrations of more than 450ppm with average temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, a point at which some catastrophic effects of global heating may become irreversible.\nAustralia's bushfires have emitted 250m tonnes of CO2, almost half of country's annual emissions\nRead more\nIn its statement explaining the forecast, the Met Office Hadley Centre highlighted the role of the Australian bushfires in contributing to the unusually large forecast annual rise.\nRichard Betts, a professor with the Met Office and the University of Exeter, said human-induced climate change and local weather patterns had contributed to the hot, dry weather that played a key role in the severity of the Australian bushfires, which in turn increased emissions.\nFires have affected more than 12m hectares of country this season, including more than 5m hectares in New South Wales.\nBetts said fossil fuel burning and deforestation had driven a year-on-year increase in carbon dioxide levels since 1958, when readings began at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, but the rate of the increase fluctuated depending on how much was absorbed by forests and other ecosystems.\nThe response of ecosystem carbon sinks was expected to be weaker than normal for a second year running as warmer and drier conditions limited the ability of plants to grow and absorb carbon dioxide, increasing the risk of wildfires that released more emissions.\n“While human-caused emissions cause the carbon dioxide rise in concentration, impacts of weather patterns on global ecosystems are predicted to increase the rise by 10% this year,” the statement says.\nIt says emissions from the Australian fires contribute “up to one-fifth of this increase”, or up to 2% of the total rise.\nLatest data shows steep rises in CO2 for seventh year\nRead more\nEmissions from bushfires are usually considered to be climate neutral in carbon accounting, based on the assumption that forest regrowth absorbs a similar amount of carbon dioxide as was released. But scientists increasingly warn this is likely to be optimistic as many burned areas never recovered to their pre-fire state.\nAdvertisement\nAustralia contributes about 1.3% of annual global emissions under UN greenhouse accounting rules.\nBill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said the wildfire emissions would not be counted in Australia’s emissions due to the way the country constructed its greenhouse gas reporting. “Along with other accounting tricks, such as Kyoto carry over, it is a clear global signal of the effect of Australia avoiding its responsibility to take real action,” he said.\nKen Thompson, a former NSW deputy commissioner for fire and rescue, said it should not be a surprise that Australia’s fires were making a mounting contribution to the climate crisis. “Our emissions from bushfires keep going up as a result of our failure to address climate change, creating the conditions for even worse fire seasons to come,” he said.\nMet Office research suggests a 2C rise in global temperatures is likely to lead to between 20 and 30 extra days of “very high” fire risk in south-western and eastern Australia each year. It found the area at risk of “extreme” fire danger conditions could increase by about 20m hectares, roughly the size of Victoria.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

That will reduce the amount of vegetation available to act as a carbon sink, meaning less carbon dioxide is removed from the air.\nExperts at the UK’s Met Office have predicted that this year will see another large rise in the carbon content of the atmosphere, which has been measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958. They predict that carbon dioxide will peak at more than 417 parts per million in May, usually the highest point of the year for carbon concentrations, and settle to about 414ppm as the average for 2020.\nThe predicted year-on-year rise of about 2.74ppm would be one of the biggest on record. Emissions from the Australian bushfires will make up one-fifth of the increase, according to the Met Office. Last year, scientists recorded the second biggest yearly increase on record, of 3.5ppm compared with 2018.\nThe absorption of carbon dioxide by land ecosystems, such as vegetation and forests, is linked to swings in Pacific Ocean temperatures, the Met Office noted. Many regions become warmer and drier in years with a warmer tropical Pacific, limiting the ability of plants to grow and absorb carbon, while the risk of wildfires increases. That has contributed to the hot dry weather in Australia, making the bushfires more severe.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nSince the Mauna Loa records began, human activities have resulted in a yearly rise in the carbon content of the air. Some years have seen only a modest rise, but in recent years the rise has been stronger, despite global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nProfessor Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “The [annual] rate of rise isn’t perfectly even because there are fluctuations in the response of ecosystem carbon sinks, especially tropical forests. Overall, these are expected to be weaker than normal for the second year running. The year-to-year variability in the rate of rise of CO2 is affected more by the strength of ecosystem carbon sinks and sources than year-to-year changes in human-induced emissions. Nevertheless, anthropogenic emissions are still the overall driver of the long-term rise in concentrations.”\nEach annual rise takes the planet closer to the crucial 450ppm threshold. That is regarded by scientists as the limit of safety, beyond which the impacts of climate change – droughts, floods, heatwaves, fiercer storms, and sea level rises – are likely to become much worse.\n“This analysis illustrates how feedback processes can accelerate the rise in greenhouse gas levels and hence the rate of warming,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “Global warming in Australia, western North America and many other parts of the world is increasing the risk and extent of wildfires, releasing ever more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Such feedback processes will lead to the exhaustion of our emissions budgets even more quickly than expected. We are closer than we think to the point of no return.”\nGovernments pledged at Paris in 2015 to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration not to exceed 1.5C. In the years since, greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 4%, according to recent estimates.\nCurrent national pledges under the Paris agreement would take the world to 3C of heating. This November, governments will meet in Glasgow to try to set the world back on track to meet the Paris goals.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Our planet faces two simultaneous existential threats,” said Mary Robinson, chair of an independent group of global leaders called The Elders, and the former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner of human rights.\nRobinson said that countries that don’t aim to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet and instead exploit fossil fuels are issuing “a death sentence for humanity”.\nShe said while public pressure presents a “sliver of hope” for the climate, there is no such pressure on leaders to avert nuclear threats.\nAs long as nuclear weapons are available it is inevitable they will one day be used, “by accident, miscalculation or design”, she said.\nRobert Rosner, chair of the Bulletin’s science and security board, said society has normalized a very dangerous world, and that “information warfare” is undermining “the public’s ability to sort out what’s true and what’s patently false”.\nSharon Squassoni, a board member and research professor at George Washington University, noted the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, which has resulted in Iran reducing compliance. And she said although some thought Donald Trump’s unique approach might bring North Korea to the negotiating table, no real progress has ensued.\nThe warning comes as nuclear arms control is in danger of dying out altogether. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty lapsed in August after the US accused Russia of cheating and Donald Trump declared he would leave the 1987 treaty altogether. The US has begun testing medium-range missiles similar to the new Russian weapon, although it is unclear where in Europe or Asia they would be based.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe death of the INF leaves the New Start treaty as the last remaining limit on the US and Russian deployed strategic arsenals. It was agreed in 2010 by the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and Barack Obama, and it expires in February 2021.\nIt can be extended for five years and Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to agree an extension, but the Trump administration has insisted that China be included. China, whose arsenal is a 20th of the two nuclear superpowers and not as aggressively deployed, has ruled out joining in.\nThe farthest the doomsday clock has ever been from midnight was 17 minutes at the end of the cold war.\nWhile nuclear warfare remains a threat, the climate crisis continues to intensify, as the US federal government under Trump has withdrawn from international climate efforts.\nLast year was the second hottest on record for the Earth’s surface. The 2019 average temperature was 1.1C warmer than the average between 1850 and 1900, before the ramp-up of fossil fuel use. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are on track to push that warming to 3 or 4C. The disruptions are intensifying extreme weather and expected to exacerbate poverty and global unrest.\n“If the Earth warms by what we tend to think of as just a few degrees and human life pushes the planet into the opposite of an Ice Age … or even pushes the climate halfway there, we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization,” said Sivan Kartha, a board member, senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute and author of the fifth and sixth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nRobert Latiff, a board member and retired air force major general, said the Trump administration’s “disdain for expert opinion” threatens action on climate change and a host of other science-based issues.

Who is she, I’m confused” – before clarifying that he was joking.\n“After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,” Mnuchin added, at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nQuick guide\nWhat is Davos 2020?\nShow\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\nThunberg, 17, responded by tweeting a graph from a UN report showing how the world’s remaining carbon budget will be used up by 2027 unless global emissions are curbed.\n“My gap year ends in August, but it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up,” she pointed out.\nMnuchin’s comments expose the huge gulf that still exists between climate activists and the White House. Pressed on the climate emergency, Mnuchin insisted that environmental issues are “clearly complicated”.\nHe said: “When I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it.\n“But nobody focuses on how that electricity is made and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries.”\nHe also claimed the US was showing leadership in tackling emissions – but through its private sector rather than government. President Trump believes in clean air and water, and a clean environment, Mnuchin insisted, but also believes that more attention should be paid to the environmental damage caused by China and India.\nPlay Video\n3:44\n'What will you tell your children?': Greta Thunberg blasts climate inaction at Davos – video\nPeople who call for divestment should remember there are “significant economic issues, issues with jobs”, he continued. “Many economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesn’t have to be all renewables.”\nAngela Merkel, though, spoke warmly about the work of the new generation of climate activists.\n“The impatience of our young people is something that we should tap,” the German chancellor said. In a special address to the WEF, Merkel called for more international cooperation to tackle climate change.\n“I am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action,” she declared.\nThunberg has used this week’s gathering in Davos to push for radical change on the climate emergency.\nShe called for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investment, an end to subsidies for the industry and a halt to investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments.\n“You might think we’re naive but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she told delegates on Tuesday.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nMnuchin’s comments clearly show the White House has yet to heed the call.\nThe US labour secretary, Eugene Scalia, called for a balanced approach. The energy sector has been an important source of jobs and fully divesting from fossil fuels would also harm US pensioners, he said.\nOn Tuesday, Trump told Davos that delegates should be optimistic.\n“To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers,” he said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Transformations that were once barely perceptible, recognisable only after the fact, this summer have become akin to a crossing. You can see the line as you step over it.\nIt’s the first summer of this new decade. Welcome. It’s the summer of ash washed up on the beaches, like a long, deranged message unfurled from its bottle. It’s the summer of a billion animals killed by flames and starvation, it’s collapsed biospheres, charred forests, epic dust storms, hailstones and racing clouds carrying fire.\nBushfire crisis: more than half of all Australians found to have been directly affected\nRead more\nIt’s the summer of the worst air quality in the world, of breathing masks and of keeping children indoors. It’s the summer of cancelled holidays, of anxious evacuations on jammed roads out of coastal hamlets. It’s fire raining on beaches, and skies that glow red at night and darken in the day. It’s the summer that Australia’s colours on Instagram went from saturated to sepia, starting in early December when people in Sydney shared photos of the weird red sun. The image at first seemed singular and disorienting until it was repeated so often (so many skies, in different cities, on so many feeds) it just came to be disorienting, and later very familiar.\nIt’s the summer of asking about people’s holiday plans and also their fire plans. It’s the summer of both generalised and specific anxiety – where despair and dread coalesced into a sort of collective bad vibe and common understanding that this is a terrible summer.\nI found myself deep in plans with strangers to join some agrarian farming collective\nIt’s the summer when faith in the political class entered some new, nihilistic nadir, where the national hero was the volunteer firefighter who said on camera that the prime minister should “get fucked” and if we believed in such a thing as a centre we would say this was the summer the centre no longer held.\nBut it’s also the summer where we held and kept faith with each other: people saving their neighbour’s home at risk to their own safety; people driving hundreds of kilometres with food for fire-affected regions; people donating water to drought-stricken farms; every coffee shop and concert and celebrity hosting a fundraiser.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s the summer when what we thought of as the union between humans and the natural world seemed suddenly and irrevocably rent. The contract was nullified. The collapse appeared total at times. A billion animals died. Some species may never return.\nIt’s the summer when climate change stopped being something we talked and argued about, an abstract thing to be debated. Instead it was the ash we breathed into our bodies, the devastation we saw with our eyes and pain felt in our hearts. When you feel it there, you can no longer deny it.\n* * *\nThose of us several degrees removed from the fire zone – who had stayed in the cities or on the unburnt side of Victoria – experienced fires as an anxiety-generating, feral echo.

The lockout laws were repealed but it seemed like a bad time to restart the party. People stayed at home and ordered UberEats.\nThe world’s media reported our situation with alarm. For a nation that craves attention we should have been pleased to be first at something. But being on the frontline of a major climate catastrophe didn’t feel so good.\nExpats felt a sudden need to return home, the way you rush to the airport and board a red eye to visit a relative on their deathbed.\nSome immigrants who had come for the “lifestyle” were similarly rethinking their choices, and talking of making the journey in reverse.\nThe good life in Australia wasn’t looking so good any more.\nFor Australians, a collective grief emerged. We yearned for the past. All summer, we spoke of previous summers – long, dusky days and evenings at the beach, unbroken weeks of sunshine and clear water, skin browning, and the days and weeks merging like a hot, salty dream – as if they were scenes from another epoch, a lost idyll.\nPart of the anxiety of this summer was that the idyll might be gone forever. In its place was strange, unpredictable weather and humans and animals that moved through this weather tentatively and with a measure of fear.\nIt’s the summer where for the first time I heard people, young people not usually prone to hyperbole or paranoia, speak plainly about the world ending.\nMy Sydney GP told me he had seen four people already that day with climate change-related anxiety and depression. He was offering them antidepressants.\nAt a lunch in Bondi, someone said we have 60 harvests left before the world will run out of food.\nThat everyone she told was alarmed and also accepting of this, and that also no one seemed to know exactly what a harvest was (is it annual, we asked – like yearly??) seemed to be both an allegory and an explanation for how we had got here.\nAfter some weeks of weird weather and non-stop fire news around the start of January, there were detectable Weimar republic vibes. Strange currents moved between unlikely people. Friends who lead stable middle-class lives had uncharacteristic nights of chaos, and found themselves going home with strange men they’d met in bars, or on drug binges with kids they had mentored, or discussing with their friends whether they would or would not kill themselves if the climate catastrophe got too bad. I found myself deep in plans with strangers to join some agrarian farming collective they were starting in the Otways and accepting detailed advice about how to build a bunker on my property, which I was scared enough to actually contemplate because my fire plan involved escaping on a bicycle.\nMeanwhile, all throughout this summer, the smoke moved around us, like a viral social media campaign, documented and populating the social media feeds of people first in Sydney, then Canberra and later Melbourne.\nThis apocalyptic Australian summer is our Sandy Hook moment – if we don't take climate action now we never will\nBrigid Delaney\nRead more\nOne day in mid-January I woke up in my cottage in central Victoria and there it was – a heavy taint in the air that had the previous day smelt so pure and clean, of oat grass dried in the wind.\nThat day it was hot and a friend and I went swimming in a reservoir out of town. The water was brackish and warm and all around was the bush, dry, silent and crackling in the 35-degree heat.

President [Emmanuel] Macron wanted a collective statement from the international organisations but Malpass vetoed it. He wouldn’t have the word multilateralism in the statement.”\nQuick guide\nWhat is Davos 2020?\nShow\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\nA spokesman for the World Economic Forum said Malpass, who was Donald Trump’s nominee to head the World Bank, had been invited. The next two most senior officials at the Washington-based institution – Axel van Trotsenburg, the bank’s managing director, and Philippe Le Houérou, the head of the bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation – are also notable absentees from Davos.\nBy a tradition that stretches back to the 1940s, the US chooses the head of the bank while the European nations pick the managing director of the IMF.\nSince taking over less than a year ago, Malpass’s prioritisation of programmes for individual countries has led to suspicions in other international bodies that the bank is in effect being run from the White House. “There is no attempt to reach out to other institutions to look for system-level policy coherence,” according to one official in Davos.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nAdvertisement\nThose more sympathetic to Malpass said he was a shy man who did not know how to do smalltalk and hated events such as Davos.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nA World Bank spokesman said: “The World Bank Group is focused squarely on efforts to alleviate poverty and boost living standards. We sent senior technical experts on climate and water to the World Economic Forum to participate in discussions on how to improve development outcomes in these priority areas.\n“World Bank Group president Malpass has just returned from the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020, where he met with over 10 leaders of several African countries to discuss challenges they face. He also engaged with private-sector clients and partners on local currency financing, capital markets, green financing and country-specific reforms that could be made to unlock private investment in developing countries.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It crunched underfoot, was carried on the furnace-blast of a breeze, dust and dry leaves rattling down the wide avenues and riverbanks of the once mighty Murray River like a premonition of loss.\nIt was written in the furrowed brows of farmers poring over district forecasts like they were scripture – ethereal in their promise of deliverance or damnation. Dry as the bones, pronounced, beneath the hides of animals starving and stunned; landscape bleached as a fossil.\nFlying into Sydney in early December as the fires ringing the city had just started to burn in earnest, I had a sense of something momentous and profound unfolding, although it still seemed like a distant crisis, one that was happening elsewhere, to other people.\nBushfire crisis: more than half of all Australians found to have been directly affected\nRead more\nThe smoke was so thick every aircraft coming in was instructed to land with full instrumentation, so we spent 40 minutes in a holding pattern over enormous fire fronts, swinging lazy circles over great billowing plumes of ember and soot.\nWalking across the tarmac from the turboprop, I glanced back over my shoulder at the blood orange sun, ash sprinkling from the amber sky.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFlying into Sydney on 6 December 2019. Photograph: Amy Coopes\nWhen speaking at an event that evening, I joked that back home we had no water but the air was clean. Go west, where the skies are blue. I left the stash of P2 masks I’d picked up, only half-seriously, on my way to the airport with a friend who said she was taking an Uber to meetings a block away because her asthma was so bad she couldn’t walk more than a few hundred metres.\nAdvertisement\nEven as I was going through the motions, paying lip service to the Anthropocene, it still seemed surreal, somehow. I got on to the plane and flew back over the Great Dividing Range, vast eucalypt tracts fizzing smoke, descending once again into the arid, but breathable, air of home.\nThere was a certain sense of foreboding in the hills in the lead-up to Christmas, as though the kindling landscape was holding its breath. The smoke swirled in from hundreds of kilometres north and settled for the festive season. We ate under grey skies, the house shuttered and our heads aching from the fumes, nights punctuated by the kind of toddler asthma attacks that leave you wired until dawn. What if he stops breathing?\nHard-earned pennies were pinched and scraped to install an air purifier in his room, and in the nursery too. We didn’t need to leave our beds to know what kind of day it would be. The ochre and rust of another hazy sunrise spilling through the blinds heralded more of the same. Asphyxia. Inertia. Well before it visited itself upon us, the taste was everywhere. Death.\nA new year\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nNew year brought conflagration. The text messages began rolling in. Are you OK? Sure, why wouldn’t we be? Turn on the news.\nIt’s a gut-churning thing to see the names of places you love, those territories of the self and heart, suddenly headlines in a story of unspeakable horror. A tornado of flame, generated by infernos of such ferocity they create their own weather, rolling a fire truck. An unborn child who will never know their father, only his sacrifice.\nAs small communities, we are constellations of people and place, oriented and anchored by and to one another. Talmalmo, Jingellic, Walwa, Corryong are more than just names in a news broadcast or an emergency warning. They are home to our families, our patients, our colleagues, our friends.\nFor the diverse nations who live and gather along the tributaries of the Murray, the Milawa Billa, there could not be a grief more piercing than watching centuries of colonial mismanagement culminate in this ultimate desecration of country, with totem and traditional routes, sacred and spiritual places pared to ash.\nWe all know someone who has lost something; everything. Photos from friends of a wall of fire racing across paddocks, engulfing life as it was once known. Everything is gone. The scars on our landscape will heal, but will we?\nA new decade\nInstead of celebrating, we rang in the new decade listening to emergency broadcasts, refreshing the Country Fire Authority and Rural Fire Service feeds, and watching Australian Defence Force water tankers flying low over our house. People gathered, muted and pale, in their yards to watch the midnight fireworks a few blocks away as the southerly swept in, acrid with ash.\nHours before the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, called his late-night press conference to announce an unprecedented state of disaster and wholesale evacuations of East Gippsland and the north-east, we’d glanced at each other uneasily as our phones had chirped, simultaneously, with an emergency text. You need to leave were the first four words.\nSurely we’ll be safe here, we said, images of what had played out in Mallacoota that week vivid in our minds. The closest bush was 2km away, the fire station on the corner. Still. The rule book appeared to have been torched. We’d been asking for years that the landlord clear the gutters; all it would take was an ember on the right sort of wind.\nWhere would we go if it came to it? Should we pack a bag? If we had to leave everything behind, what would be essential to take? We laughed at ourselves as we had these conversations – the river would be safe, if we could drive. The showground, if we had to walk. We found the passports.\nThere were other matters to consider as thousands of people from surrounding villages and communities streamed into town, towing caravans, horse floats, trailers crammed with all things practical and precious. The supermarkets began selling out of water, servos between here and more distant towns ran out of petrol. It seemed prepper paranoid, but we agreed I should go out and fill up the car and do a massive shop. Just in case.\nVenturing out into the eerie still of the morning at sunrise, it could have been winter, a mephitic fug enveloping the town like mist. By the time I came out of the supermarket, where the water shelves were stripped bare and the aisles were hazy, the smoke had rolled in so thick they had disabled the automatic doors and taped a sign over the glass. Auto doors closed due to smoke. Please use side doors. Above the blood bank the sun rose, sanguineous; soporific.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nMyer Centrepoint, central Albury, on 3 January.

Photograph: Amy Coopes\nAdvertisement\nThe sports stadium down the street opened to evacuees, along with the showground. I’d never seen so many people in town, their apprehension as palpable as the baking heat.\nThe outpouring of support for displaced and dispossessed families and for firefighters was astonishing. Within hours of the RFS issuing their daily list of required items for affected communities and crews, it would be filled.\nTraffic was banked up for kilometres along the bush blocks adjoining the RFS HQ, an operation of military precision marshalling locals and their stocked boots to the driveway to unload. Dozens of volunteers sorted goods on to pallets and into shipping containers for distribution to outlying communities where people were without power, water or food. Some had lost the roof over their heads, their world reduced to ash.\nA ute sat in the RFS driveway, its tray overflowing with fruit and vegetables, a pallet stacked with eskies dropped off the by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, alongside.\nWe handed over half a dozen shopping bags, and a drawing by our three-year-old son for the fireys. A burly volunteer crouched down to shake his hand and pinned it up, pride of place, on the noticeboard. As we prepared to leave, a pensioner pulled up in a clapped-out Commodore, a plastic bag full of odds and ends proffered from the passenger seat. It isn’t much, I’m sorry. I blinked away tears.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAlbury, January 2020. Photograph: Amy Coopes\nBreaking\nThe day of the firestorm, 4 January, we hit a record-breaking 46C in town. Clumsy with foreboding, I stepped awkwardly off our back deck and broke my ankle, lying dazed and thirsty in the heat. While the worst of the winds swept across the firegrounds I was in hospital, nauseous with morphine and still gripping the “green whistle”, though it had long since been sucked empty.\nAdvertisement\nBy sunrise, I was sober, but the air outside was so toxic that, propped up in bed with towels stuffed around the doors and windows, I still had to wear a mask. Our 10-month-old was so hoarse and distressed I gave her Ventolin; she isn’t asthmatic.\nThe PM2.5 reading (something I had only a passing acquaintance with before this summer) climbed steadily throughout the day to almost 3,000 – 15 times the level considered hazardous – before the local monitoring station went offline for the best part of a day. It seemed symbolic of the cataclysm that had unfolded in the surrounding towns and valleys, where the skies were a filthy orange and visibility reduced to metres at best.\nDays stretched into another week of wheezing confinement, while the prime minister bleated on about Australia being the best country in the world to raise kids. I cried when, during one of those impromptu toddler confidences, my son told me that one day he’d be older than me. I cried because I wonder if he will.\nTo live to be my age, he will have to make it to 2055, when climate change will have rendered much of the planet inhospitable to human life, driven mass extinctions of almost every kind of species, and unleashed civil unrest over resources like food and water on a scale at which there is no precedent in human history.\nMoreso than the anxiety or political fury of this summer, I have been gripped by an insurmountable grief for my children and the life I took for granted which they will never be able to share.\nIn a matter of days, 9 January, there was another evacuation order, more fires. Several straddling state borders joined up to become a “megablaze”, terminology I’d never had need for before this grim new decade. Millions of hectares of pristine national park went up, places as familiar to me as laboured breath. The roof of Australia aflame, the Alps snowy at the height of summer, with ash.\nAs ever-increasing tracts of Mount Buffalo burned we could, on a rare clear evening, see the great fungating shadow of a pyrocumulonimbus cloud looming over the horizon, a sign that what raged below was so intense it was generating its own weather.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nFire maps for 10 January 2020 in NSW. Photograph: Amy Coopes\nDefining images\nAdvertisement\nThere are many images that will come to define this summer: smog settling so thick over Sydney Harbour its iconic landmarks were obscured, the starved and scorched koalas of Kangaroo Island, a masked schoolkid steering a tinny offshore as Mallacoota was devoured by an avaricious inferno, Scott Morrison hanging a shaka on the Waikiki waterfront.\nBut if you’ve lived in a fire zone, the pyroCb or cumulonimbus flammagenitus will stay with you forever, as a harbinger of the Anthropocene. Ignis aurum probat.\nTen days into the decade, the alerts sounded uncomfortably close to home. A grass fire on the Beechworth-Wodonga road – a route we would have travelled more times than you could count – was suddenly racing out of control towards the semi-rural outskirts of Wodonga, our sister city, home to some 40,000 people, just across the Murray River.\nAs quickly as it had started, fuelled by a wild southerly change with lightning and 100km/h winds, the blaze was declared emergency level. You are in danger. Act now to protect yourself. It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.\nThose in the area who could evacuate made their way into town to shelter at The Cube performance space; others hosed down their roofs and gutters, watching anxiously as water bombing aircraft flew sorties overhead, trying to contain the advancing flames.\nDefence crews were mobilised as the blaze spotted towards a string of barracks and bases where hundreds of unfortunate people displaced earlier in the week had taken refuge. In the next valley, residents of a relatively new development known as White Box Rise were urged to get out.\nIn among the frantic messages from loved ones as we again hit the headlines was a text from friends who had just bought in White Box and had been scheduled to return from Melbourne that week from their Christmas holiday with their newborn baby. We’d convinced them to delay due to the smoke. This is the other side of our hill, they captioned a screenshot of the emergency alert. Sweet Jesus. Our house.\nAs night fell, the winds eased, and a smattering of rain brought some much-needed reprieve. Evacuees were, in waves, permitted to return home. There was a nagging, contradictory sense that the gun was never really loaded, but we’d dodged a bullet nonetheless.\nGolden words\nReams have already been written about this grim summer; an unwelcome but imperative clarion call to the millions of us sleepwalking toward the abyss.\nJust two months ago I sat in a climate-themed medical conference where they discussed the need for field hospitals, colocation of emergency triage and primary care, new ways of doing business when the climate rendered business-as-usual obsolete. The fires were burning, even then, and Prof David Bowman warned us that this was a season like no other.\nAdvertisement\nYet it all seemed so abstract; so rhetorical. The climate emergency was something that was happening elsewhere, to other people. Until it wasn’t.\nAndrews has described this as a summer of firsts; there’s been so many now they seem to have lost impact as time goes on.\nBut there are snapshots of this season I won’t forget. Toddlers receiving commendations for bravery on behalf of fathers who will miss a lifetime of milestones. Stepping on to the tarmac under that ominous, orange sky, the scarcest smattering of ash on the breeze. Evacuation sirens; smoke so dense it cancels out the sun. The fear in my son’s eyes as he struggled to catch a breath. Thousands upon thousands of livestock charred and scattered by the road; millions upon millions of native animals – likely entire species – incinerated.\nWe need new words for collective grief of this scale.\nThere are political observations to be made, and urgent agendas to be advanced if – and indeed, it feels so precariously like an if – we wish to survive. Already, the goalposts have shifted to “the new normal”; summers spent indoors lest the air chokes us all, Christmas under slate and noxious skies, evacuation orders covering ever-larger concentric circles until, at last, there is nothing left to burn and nowhere left to run.\nIf we are to take anything from this season of solastalgia, it must be the immense grace and goodwill, courage and conviction that abides in our communities and comes to the fore when it’s needed most.\nAs our climate becomes more hostile, perhaps the single greatest risk is that, in tandem, so do we. The learned helplessness of neoliberalism not only invites us to believe that we, as individuals, are powerless, it depends on it.\nBut we’ve seen something else entirely forged in these long months: leadership from the grassroots, the ability of communities to rally around one another not thanks to political action but in spite of it.\nIgnis aurum probat, miseria fortes viros. As gold is tempered by fire, so strong men are tempered by suffering.\nCollectively, our strength is infinite. Now, more than ever, we must live as testament to that.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAmy Coopes, photographed on 6 January 2020.

With a €1tn ($1.1tn) investment package, it hopes to transform Europe into a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.\nBut much of that €1tn for the commission’s proposed green deal would be generated through financial-leverage effects. In 2020, the EU will formally allocate for such purposes only around €40bn, most of which is already included in the budget from previous years; arguably, only €7.5bn of additional funding under the plan would actually be new.\nAs with the previous commission’s 2015 Juncker plan, the trick, once again, will be to muster the lion’s share of the quoted sum through a shadow budget administered by the European Investment Bank (EIB). The commission, after all, is not allowed to incur debt; but the EU’s intergovernmental rescue and investment funds are.\nThe best way to help the climate is to increase the price of CO2 emissions\nJeffrey Frankel\nRead more\nIn essence, the EU is doing what the major banks did before the 2008 financial crisis, when they circumvented regulation by shifting part of their business to off-balance-sheet conduits and special-purpose vehicles. In the case of the EU, the guarantees offered by the commission and individual EU member states are sufficient for a high credit rating, and thus for the issuance of European debenture bonds. The funds generated will be used for public and private purposes, and sometimes even for public-private partnerships. But should the guarantees be called in one day, eurozone taxpayers will be the ones to foot the bill.\nAdvertisement\nThese planned shadow budgets are problematic, not only because they would allow the commission to circumvent a prohibition against borrowing, but also because they implicate the European Central Bank. To be sure, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, has already announced that she wants the bank to play a more active role in climate-friendly activities within the eurozone. And the ECB is now considering whether to pursue targeted purchases of bonds issued by institutions that have received the commission’s climate seal of approval.\nIn practice, of course, this most likely means that the ECB would buy up the “green” bonds now being devised by the EIB. Those purchases will then reduce the interest rates at which the EIB can take on debt, ultimately leading to activation of the printing press to provide the money for spending on climate policy.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nIt is laudable to want to do something about climate change. But under the current plan, the ECB would be pushed into a legal grey area. The institution is not democratically controlled, but rather managed by technocrats on the executive board. Every member state, big or small, appoints its own representative, who then has equal voting rights, personal immunity, and the autonomy to operate free from any parliamentary accountability.\nMoreover, under the Maastricht treaty, the ECB board is primarily obligated to maintain price stability, and may support separate economic-policy measures only if doing so does not endanger its ability to fulfil this mandate. In the case of the green deal, the dangers are obvious. If the additional demand created by an expansion of green projects is funded by printing money instead of collecting taxes, it will not withdraw demand from other sectors of the European economy and would therefore be potentially inflationary.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nSituations like this serve as a reminder of why article 123 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union strictly prohibits the ECB from taking part in the financing “of Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local, or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of member states”. But, of course, the ECB has already circumvented this rule by purchasing around €2tn in public debt from the market, thereby stretching the limits of its mandate to a legally dubious degree.\nThe latest plans to circumvent the Maastricht treaty will not improve matters. Before the financial crisis, the ECB was concerned only with monetary policy. During the crisis, it turned into a public bailout authority rescuing near-bankrupt banks and governments. Now, it is becoming an economic government that can print its budget as it sees fit.\nThe impending violation of the spirit of the Maastricht treaty will be twofold: the EU will be assuming debt covertly, and it will be doing so through the printing press. As such, the commission’s plans will further undermine the credibility of the very institution on which Europe relies for its financial and macroeconomic stability and its long-term growth prospects – and this at a time when the world is becoming even more uncertain, competitive and aggressive.\n• Hans-Werner Sinn, is professor of economics at the University of Munich.

It alleges the self-styled \"very stable genius” has been described as an idiot by Rupert Murdoch and a moron by Rex Tillerson. Wolff says the thing that interests the US president most is watching himself on television. “I consider it to be fiction,” said Trump of the book. Many others were not so sure.\nRead the review.\nSean Spicer – The Briefing\nSean Spicer's 182 days as press secretary yielded a book that tells of a White House where people would routinely bring in \"burner phones\" to avoid being caught leaking, He describes Trump as sometimes being his own worst enemy with his manic tweeting, and recalls his downfall essentially started on day one, when Spicer was responsible for attempts to spin the news on the president's dismal inauguration crowds. Perhaps, though, the highlight is when Spicer describes Trump as “a unicorn riding a unicorn over a rainbow'.\nRead the review.\nOmarosa Manigault Newman – Unhinged\nThe most prominent African American in the Trump White House before she was abruptly dismissed, Newman spread her criticism liberally. Her description of the vice-president, Mike Pence, as the \"Stepford veep\" is one of the kinder sideswipes.\nOf the more jaw-dropping revelations, the suggestion Trump had initially asked to be sworn in over a copy of The Art of the Deal, instead of the Bible, is a hard image to shake.\nRead the review.\nCliff Sims – Team of Vipers\nCliff Sims' book suggested he had made enemies and alienated people throughout the administration. He was particularly scathing about Sarah Sanders, Trump’s former press secretary. Her “gymnastics with the truth\", he said, \"would tax even the nimblest of prevaricators, and Sanders was not that”.\nRead the review.\nAnonymous – A Warning\nFrom a senior official in the Trump administration – and so many have left and fallen out with the president – Trump is described as “like a 12-year-old in an air traffic control tower”.\nThe unknown author adds: “It’s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pants-less across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him”\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nBP said in a letter to the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) in August 2018 that streamlining the Nepa process would “directly benefit BP’s operations in the US”. The letter was discovered by Greenpeace’s investigation unit.\nBP is planning to increase its business in the US after agreeing to pay $10.5bn (£8bn) to buy BHP Billiton’s shale business last year.\nMel Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said BP’s support for weakening environmental checks was “despicable, but not surprising”.\nThe oil firm’s lobbying efforts have emerged amid reports that it plans to “out-do” the climate action of Royal Dutch Shell with a set of new emissions targets.\nThe latest major Trump resignations and firings\nRead more\nBernard Looney, BP’s new chief executive, is preparing to announce plans to expand its climate targets to include emissions produced from the fuels and products it sells and not just from its own operations, according to Reuters.\nThe plans are likely to appear at odds with BP’s support for the American Petroleum Institute which it expresses in the CEQ letter. The API, a trade body for oil and gas producers, told the CEQ that emissions from fossil fuel products “should not be considered part of ‘indirect’ effects” under future environmental checks.\nMichael Sommers, who heads the API, has taken the lead in criticising the “endless and repetitive reviews” required by Nepa, arguing that the laws had been “misused to delay and derail development, which hurts job creation, reduces tax revenue and saps investments in communities across the country”.\nPlay Video\n1:38\nTrump decries climate 'prophets of doom' in Davos keynote speech - video\nAdvertisement\nBP has also called for air quality checks to be scrapped and to limit the changes government agencies can demand to help mitigate the environmental impact of major projects.\nIt said companies should be allowed to pay for their own environmental assessments because the personnel constraints within some government agencies have had a significant impact on their ability to undertake the review “in a timely manner”.\nIn terms of air quality reviews, BP argued that third-party reviews were unnecessary and should be scrapped in favour of a review undertaken by the company which leveraged “the project proponent’s expertise”.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nIts letter to the CEQ said BP supported more than 125,000 jobs in the US, and the company’s operations contributed $85bn to the American economy in 2017 alone.\nA spokesman for BP said: “Neither BP nor API advocated to exclude all indirect greenhouse gas impacts from Nepa analysis. In fact, BP believes the Nepa analysis should include all direct and many indirect impacts.”\nThe company said it had worked alongside a US conservation group, The Nature Conservancy, to push only for changes which were “consistent with our strong support for the Paris [climate agreement] ambitions”.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Voluntary measures have failed, it said.\nThe CCC’s new report concludes that fundamental changes in land use are needed to cut emissions from farming and get the nation on track to meet its legally binding target of net zero by 2050. It proposes cutting red meat eating by 20%, with the move to more plant-based diets freeing up a fifth of all farmland for new woodland.\nAdvertisement\nThe CCC’s plan for slashing emissions from agriculture also requires better management of manure, cutting methane from cattle with better feeds and growing crops that can be burned to produce electricity instead of natural gas.\nThe plan would cost £1.4bn a year but provide benefits of at least £4bn by cutting global heating and air pollution and improving flood protection and green spaces for people to enjoy. “That, in our assessment, seems like a price very much worth paying,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC.\nLord Deben, chair of the CCC, said: “This is one of the most important reports that we have ever produced because a change in land use is absolutely essential if we’re going to meet [the legal] requirements of reducing to net zero by 2050. It requires immediate government action. We are in a race against time.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe UK is preparing to leave the European Union and the bloc’s subsidy scheme, which provides £3.3bn a year to farmers based mainly on the area of land owned. The government has pledged that the replacement scheme will pay farmers public money for public goods, such as tree planting.\nOther groups have called for radical overhauls of farmland, which occupies 70% of the UK. Rewilding Britain suggests that a quarter of the UK’s land could be restored to nature, while an RSA commission said the true costs of cheap food were the climate crisis and a health crisis. A former chief scientific adviser to the UK government said in December that half of the nation’s farmland needed to be transformed into woodlands and natural habitat.\nThe most eye-catching part of the CCC’s plan, according to Stark, is the proposal that new levies on fossil fuel suppliers, airlines and other carbon-emitting industries pay for the tree-planting programme. Farmers and landowners would be paid either via annual auctions of contracts to create woodland or from a carbon trading scheme, the CCC said.\nThe cost would be about £700m a year, Stark said. “You could imagine a world where that was all paid for from a fossil fuel levy, but that is a decision for the Treasury.” Such a system would mean the polluter pays, said Deben, but the aviation industry would still need to keep emissions at 2005 levels.\nThe National Farmers Union revealed a plan for agriculture to end its net emissions by 2040 in September, a decade earlier than the CCC plan. It requires no cut in meat eating or livestock numbers and no conversion of substantial areas of farmland into forest. It relies heavily on bioenergy crops removing CO2 from the atmosphere, which is then captured and buried after being burned.\nDeben praised the NFU plan as a remarkable change. “NFU president, Minette Batters, has done a very significant job. But the truth is she hasn’t been able to include anything about diet and reduction in the number of animals”, both of which the CCC deem essential.\nStark said cutting the UK’s “scandalous” level of food waste by 20% was vital. Better food labelling and separate food waste collections would help, as well as linking charges for household recycling to the quantity of food waste, the CCC said.\nThe 20% cut in red meat and dairy consumption proposed by the CCC is much lower than other recent analyses which have indicated 80-90% reductions are needed. “It is some way short of the 80% or so reduction that’s recommended by the public health guidelines for red meat,” said Stark. The CCC focused only on the emissions cuts needed to bring UK greenhouse gas emissions to zero, he said, and not health or other pollution that livestock cause.\nAvoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth\nRead more\n“There is no doubt we need a major transformation in farming and land use to tackle both climate and nature emergencies,” said Vicki Hird of the Sustain alliance, who welcomed much of the report. But she said the ambition on cutting meat consumption was low and warned that technology that could capture CO2 from bioenergy crops was untested in the UK.\nSandra Bell, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The way land is used and abused has been a big contributor to climate breakdown and loss of wildlife, and this is why it needs to change.” However she said the CCC’s woodland creation target needed to be twice as high.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Its rain washes around the old, laid trunks of hedge sycamores, its wind blows goldfinch from mullein seedheads under power lines into hazels; its noise silences the thrush who, for some days in his ash tree, has been auditioning an oratory of fragmented phrases repeated in short bursts that will become a heart-stopping song before too long. The moss appears unaffected by the traffic of people, dogs and birds, unaffected by the seasons and the sudden appearance of snowdrops from a recurring dream.\nCommon feather-moss, Kindbergia praelonga, has branching ferny shoots up to 3cm long, with divided leaves that in some woodland forms are bipinnate or tripinnate with triangular-shaped tips so they look like feathers; they can be found in moist, shady places on a variety of surfaces.\nLittle has been known of the chemistry of mosses such as Kindbergia, but research reveals within them a remarkable reservoir of anti-microbial, anti-fungal, cardiotonic, tumour-affecting, allergy-causing, plant-growth-regulating, even possible Aids-therapy chemicals.\nNew life radiates from a fallen oak\nRead more\nIn a world that hardly recognises the presence of this feathery miracle, away from the lane’s verges in the thick of the wood, Kindbergia spreads across the ground and over stones and logs, climbs up trees, posts, rocks and banks. If I stand here long enough it will creep up from my boots and plume me over in a green quiet like a rotting log.\nThis warmer, wetter climate is a mossy place. Palaeoecological evidence over 9,000 years shows that some kinds of moss can tolerate warmer and drier conditions; however, most of Britain’s mossy bogs, fens and mires are too physically degraded to cope with climate heating.\nMoss in places of humidity and shelter like this wood is, at the moment, creating a miniature rainforest layer with its own dimensions of space and time, its own inhabitants, re-establishing a beyond-world to cover the one we are familiar with. This winter pall – a word that comes from the covering of a tomb or shroud for the dead – holds its own glow in a greenwood of the shadows, an effulgence despite the leafless trees and lightless skies above.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It’s not consistent with the way in which a prime minister would and should act.”\nMorrison cut short his family holiday to Hawaii after two volunteer firefighters in New South Wales died. He came home two days early and apologised, saying he “deeply regretted” any offence caused.\nBut he was then heckled on a visit to the fire-ravaged town of Cobargo in NSW, where three people died, and mistakenly said that nobody had died on South Australia’s Kangaroo Island, where two people had died.\nAdvertisement\n“I do not know why Scott Morrison has acted the way he has,” Turnbull said. “I’ve known him for 20 years, at least. I can’t explain his conduct.”\nMorrison’s personal approval rating and rating as preferred prime minister fell in the first polls after the bushfire season began.\n“I can’t explain why he didn’t meet the former fire commissioners who wanted to see him in March last year to talk about the gravity of the threat,” Turnbull said.\nIn November the former fire chiefs said Morrison had turned down a meeting with them because his government “fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change”.\nTurnbull also criticised the role of rightwing politics in Australia and the Murdoch press in promoting climate denialism.\n“If you go to any of the rightwing thinktanks or read the Murdoch press it is just full of climate denialism,” he said. “And it is designed to deflect from the real objective which has to be to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\nScott Morrison's stance on climate change makes it harder for future governments to undo his damage\nGreg Jericho\nRead more\n“To be a climate change denier is a badge of honour on the right wing of politics here and in the US, and it is mad.”\nTurnbull said Australia was “in the frontline of the consequences” and needed to act on the climate crisis to show the world that it was important.\n“How many more coral reefs have to be bleached, how many more million hectares of forest have to be burned?” he asked. “How many more lives and homes have to be lost before the climate change deniers acknowledge they are wrong?\n“If a country like Australia is not prepared to grapple with this issue seriously, itself being in the frontline of the consequences and being an advanced, prosperous, technologically sophisticated country, with the means to do so, then why would other countries take the issue as seriously as they should?”\nOn Tuesday Morrison said reducing fuel loads with hazard reduction burns was at least as important as reducing carbon emissions to prevent future bushfire disasters.\n“Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has an even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season,” he told the Australian.\nIn November former heads of the NSW, Queensland, Victorian and Tasmanian fire services said they were not allowed “to utter the words ‘climate change’” even though it contributed to longer, more intense bushfires.\n“Bushfires are a symptom of climate change,” said Neil Bibby, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority.\n“Firefighters are the immune system that gets rid of that symptom.

For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\nThe prince was speaking after launching an initiative, the Sustainable Markets Initiative and Council. His 10 proposals included the rapid decarbonisation of businesses, driving investment in new environmentally friendly technologies and helping consumers to make sustainable choices.\nClimate change, biodiversity loss and global warming are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced, he warned, adding that capital needs to be properly deployed in order to tackle these threats.\nThe prince said global consumers could make markets sustainable, but could not make sustainable choices if these options were not clearly laid before them.\nCharles also warned that being socially and environmentally conscious cannot be an option for wealthier people only. Markets needed to change, so that prices actually reflected the environmental as well as economic costs.\n“If all the true costs are taken into account, being socially and environmentally responsible should be the least expensive option because it leaves the smallest footprint behind,” he argued, implicitly calling for subsidies and tax changes.\nCharles’s intervention comes nearly 30 years after he last spoke at the World Economic Forum, when he had already begun campaigning on environmental issues and corporate responsibility.

The biggest problem with the prime minister’s shift towards blaming the states and doing all he can to avoid actual emissions cuts is he continues to make it even harder for future governments to undo his damage.\nLet us never again suggest this government might be about to take climate change seriously. Scott Morrison has taken the view that saying he believes in climate change is enough to avoid any suggestion that he is in fact a climate change denier.\nIn reality he is like a bloke who says he is against drink-driving, but then tells his mates the way to drive home from the pub without getting caught by the cops.\nScott Morrison's senior ministers discuss how to reposition climate policies\nRead more\nNo one who believes in climate change would continue to boast of Australia’s record on emissions reductions. And no one would also say, as he did on Tuesday on Sky News, “hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so”.\nAnd remember, he is not just talking about hazard reduction burning, but actual land clearing.\nI guess you can’t have bushfires if you have no bush.\nThe problem however is that the government’s intransigence on climate change is not something that can just be forgotten should they lose the next election.\nC02 emitted in one year doesn’t vanish when the calendar flips to 1 January – it remains in the atmosphere, and at a certain point the total amount will have us at a point of no return.\nAll the talk about needing to cut emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 in order to keep temperatures from rising 1.5C over pre-industrial levels is based on the view of the world’s “carbon budget” and how much we have remaining.\nThink of it like having $1,500 to spend in a month. If you spend $50 a day, you’ll be fine, but if you spend $75 a day, you will have to live on nothing for the last 10 days.\nThe world is estimated to be able to emit a certain amount of cumulative emissions before we reach a point where hitting 1.5C and then 2C is inevitable.\nGiven the amount the world has emitted since the industrial revolution, the IPCC estimates if we keep going at our current levels we will hit our budget limit for 1.5C in about 10 years.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe recommendation for 45% cuts by 2030 and to 0% by 2050 are all based around keeping within the carbon budget.\nThis means that the important thing is not being 45% below 2010 levels in 2030, but that a 45% cut by then should be enough – but only if we start now.\nIf we start later, we will need deeper cuts, otherwise we will go over our carbon budget.\nIt’s also why Anthony Albanese’s statement about future targets is a bit troubling.\nIn his interview on Sunday with Sky News’s Andrew Clennell he very much hedged about what the ALP’s target for emissions cuts would be, and suggested “I think it was a mistake in 2019 to continue to say, ‘Well, we’ll do exactly what we’re doing in 2015’, as if it hadn’t changed”.\nHe is right, but the problem is he does not seem to be indicating that what has changed means the cuts will have to be greater.\nThe government currently is estimating the path to a 26% cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 will start from a level of 509 Mt C02e in 2020 and reduce emissions by 5.6Mt each year until hitting 452Mt in 2030.\nSo in effect the government has stated its carbon budget for this decade is 5,286Mt.\nBut the current projection is for us to emit 534Mt this year. So, straight off the bat we are 25Mt over budget. That necessarily means (assuming we want a nice linear path) if we are to keep within our budget we will have to end in 2030 at a level lower than 452Mt.\nIn fact it would be 427Mt.\nAnthony Albanese flags 'ambitious' emissions target but won't recommit to 45% reduction\nRead more\nJust how much deeper the cuts that are needed, the longer we go on our current projected path, is highlighted by comparing what is required if we keep going on our current projections to 2023 to the current path:\nBy 2023 on current projections, we will be 98Mt over budget and would need to target a path to 405Mt by 2030 just to keep within our 10-year budget.\nThe problem for the ALP is this makes getting to 45% even tougher.\nLet’s say they win in 2022. It would be difficult to make any great changes that come into effect before the end of 2023, so let’s lock in the projections until then.\nGiven a 45% cut means a smaller 10-year budget (just 4,675Mt), this would mean to keep within that budget we would need to have a 2030 target of just 252Mt – some 59% below 2005 levels:\nBut the problem of course is that all includes land use. If we remove that dodgy accounting and keep our 45% target, it reduces our budget for this decade to just 4,487Mt.\nIf the current projections stay in place till 2023, that means to keep within that budget we would need a target of around 180Mt in 2030 – or some 65% below 2005 levels.\nThe need for emissions cuts is urgent. We cannot wait until 2030, and the longer we wait, the more of our carbon budget we use and the faster and deeper the cuts will be needed to make.\nFor all his blather about adaptation, as Morrison ignores the need for emissions cuts, he is not only letting down people now, he is ensuring it will be harder to adapt to a low carbon economy in the future.\n• Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

We were, he said, “doing our bit” and “carrying our weight”.\nThose are lines with which you might dismiss an overzealous charity panhandler: “I’ve already given, thank you!”\nI tried to warn Scott Morrison about the bushfire disaster. Adapting to climate change isn’t enough\nGreg Mullins\nRead more\nThey’re a response to a tiresome obligation. They’re not a promise of solutions.\nMorrison has not said that temperatures will stabilise and the climate emergency will be averted.\nHow could he?\nThe only international mechanism currently in place stems from the Paris accords, the agreement by which the nations of the world pledged to keep global temperature rises below 2C.\nA growing perception of state impotence will almost certainly be accompanied by ever more aggressive demonstrations of state power\nBut Paris is palpably failing. None of the major powers will meet their targets – and no other plan exists.\nIn democratic theory, the modern state legitimates itself through a simple bargain: we pay its taxes and obey its law. In return, it protects us and keeps us safe.\nThe increasing inability of states to keep that pact in respect of climate will only become more obvious, exacerbating an already widespread cynicism about the political class.\nParadoxically, a growing perception of state impotence will almost certainly be accompanied by ever more aggressive demonstrations of state power.\nIn Australia, Morrison’s supporters talk about fuel loads and arson.\nIn part, the pivot away from climate represents a simple bait and switch. After the world recorded its second-hottest year ever, conversations about hazard reduction help drown out conversations about climate.\nBut the new focus also shifts the debate in a direction the government likes.\nIf environmental bureaucracy had prevented hazard reduction (it didn’t), the answer lies in slashing green tape, an easy extension of an already existing ideological commitment to deregulation.\nMore importantly, the identification of (a largely bogus) arson outbreak transforms an ecological crisis into a law and order problem, paving the way for new legislation and fresh penalties.\nAnd that’s something the state can deliver.\nNo one job is worth saving at the expense of climate catastrophe. Not even Scott Morrison's\nRichard Denniss\nRead more\nThink of Morrison’s almost instant response to the needles-in-the-strawberry affair. Decrying fruit saboteurs as “cowards” and “grubs”, the prime minister introduced harsh new laws that would send them to jail for as long as 15 years.\nMore police powers and increased sentences play to the strengths of what Nietzsche called “the cold monster”, allowing the leaders who announce them to sound stern and authoritative.\nAccordingly, in Australia in 2019, politicians spent more time discussing how best to punish environmental protesters than they did devising legislation that might protect the climate.\nPeter Dutton, for instance, called for activists to be “shamed”, jailed and cut off welfare.\n“These people are anarchists and fringe-dwellers and they should face the full force of the law,” he said.\nNo government minister used similar rhetoric about carbon polluters.\nSimilarly, in Queensland, the Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk almost certainly can’t deliver the jobs that rural supporters of Adani think the Carmichael coalmine will bring them (the employment promises keep shifting) and nor can she save the Great Barrier Reef (since that would entail stopping climate change).\nShe can, however, rush through Joh-era style laws to jail Extinction Rebellion members.\nThe state, by definition, possesses a monopoly on coercion. As a result, politicians incapable of any real policy agenda know they still unleash force.\nAs Morrison himself says, the core responsibility of a prime minister is to “keep Australians safe”.\nIf the 2019-2020 fire season really does foreshadow the new normal on a warming planet, governments face a looming crisis of legitimacy, precisely because there’s nothing safe about a country in flames.\nBeware terrorists but don't sweat the climate crisis – how blind can Morrison be?\nJeff Sparrow\nRead more\nWe’re likely, then, to see politicians asserting authority in an all too traditional way, with an increasing resort to the rhetoric of national security.\nAs I have argued previously, it’s not difficult to imagine what Morrison’s slogans of “resilience and adaption” might mean in the context of, say, climate refugees.\nFor decades, we’ve seen asylum seekers used as targets whenever a weak leader wants to look tough.\nGlobal heating will make future governments seem extraordinarily weak – even as a huge new wave of refugees arrives.\nIn the midst of a genuine emergency, with the army already on the streets, the likely conjunction of climate and border politics does not bear thinking about.\n• Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In Victoria, the figure was 29%, but the survey was taken from 8-12 January, before the hazardous levels of smoke haze hit Melbourne the following week.\nWith 9% of respondents saying they had missed work because of the fires or smoke, the Australia Institute is estimating that at least 1.8 million work days were lost as a result, based on the assumption of one day off for each worker affected.\nUsing Australian Bureau of Statistics labour figures, the survey estimated disruption of the workforce to have cost more than $1.3bn in lost economic production, which it says is a “conservative” estimate.\n“In many areas, including in large cities, workplaces closed for many days and in some cases for a week or more,” the survey said. “If we assume an average of two days of lost production on average, the estimate of lost production doubles to $2.6bn.”\nThe research also showed a correlation between those directly affected by the fires and concern about the impacts of climate change.\nPeople who had been impacted by the fires were much more likely to be “very concerned” about climate change (58%) than those not impacted (32%). Those directly affected were also more likely (68%) to say Australia is experiencing “a lot” of climate change impacts, compared with those not affected (42%).\nThe findings also showed greater concern for Australia’s forests and wildlife and government inaction among this group.\nOnly about a third of all surveyed said they believed the federal Coalition had done a “good job managing the crisis”.\nTom Swann, senior researcher at the Australia Institute, said the findings underscored the extent of the “vast” social, economic and medical impacts of Australia’s “national climate disaster”.\nWill Australia's wildlife recover from this bushfire season?\n“This research suggests that, as Australians face the escalating impacts of climate change in their own lives, calls for policies that reduce carbon emissions will continue to grow,” Swann said.\n“Even looking simply at lost work days, the bill is in the billions of dollars. The broader impacts and recovery efforts will cost many billions more and take many years.\n“That is why it is so concerning that rising emissions threaten to make events like this even more common in the future.”\nAdvertisement\nSwann said the findings should give extra impetus to the organisation’s call for a levy on fossil fuel producers to help pay for the escalating cost of natural disasters.\n“Establishing a National Climate Disaster Fund would move some of the financial burden of these events from the households, businesses and taxpayers that are currently forced to pick up the tab,” he said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The report’s authors warn that treating the world’s resources as limitless is leading towards global disaster.\nThe materials used by the global economy have quadrupled since 1970, far faster than the population, which has doubled. In the last two years, consumption has jumped by more than 8% but the reuse of resources has fallen from 9.1% to 8.6%.\nThe report, by the Circle Economy thinktank, was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It shows that, on average, every person on Earth uses more than 13 tonnes of materials per year. But the report also found that some nations are making steps towards circular economies in which renewable energy underpins systems where waste and pollution are reduced to zero.\n“We risk global disaster if we continue to treat the world’s resources as if they are limitless,” said Harald Friedl, the chief executive of Circle Economy. “Governments must urgently adopt circular economy solutions if we want to achieve a high quality of life for close to 10bn people by mid-century without destabilising critical planetary processes.”\nMarc de Wit, the report’s lead author, said: “We are still fuelling our growth in population and affluence by the extraction of virgin materials. We can’t do this indefinitely – our hunger for virgin material needs to be halted.”\nTrump blasts 'prophets of doom' in attack on climate activism\nRead more\nThe report found that 100.6bn tonnes of materials were consumed in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. Half of the total is sand, clay, gravel and cement used for building, along with the other minerals quarried to produce fertiliser. Coal, oil and gas make up 15% and metal ores 10%. The final quarter are the plants and trees used for food and fuel.\nThe lion’s share of the materials – 40% – is turned into housing. Other major categories include food, transport, healthcare, communications, and consumer goods such as clothes and furniture.\nAlmost a third of the annual materials remain in use after a year, such as buildings and vehicles. But 15% is emitted into the atmosphere as climate-heating gases and nearly a quarter is discarded into the environment, such as plastic in waterways and oceans. A third of the materials is treated as waste, mostly going to landfill and mining spoil heaps. Just 8.6% is recycled.\n“This report sparks an alarm for all governments,” said Carolina Schmidt, Chile’s environment minister. “We need to deploy all the policies to really catalyse this transformation [to a circular economy].”\nCristianne Close of the conservation group WWF said: “The circular economy provides a framework for reducing our impacts, protecting ecosystems and living within the means of one planet.”\nThe report said increasing recycling can make economies more competitive, improve living conditions and help to meet emissions targets and avoid deforestation. It reported that 13 European countries have adopted circular economy roadmaps, including France, Germany and Spain, and that Colombia became the first Latin American country to launch a similar policy in 2019.\nChina’s ban on waste imports aims to encourage domestic recycling, the report said, but has also stimulated the development of circular economy strategies in Australia and other countries which previously exported their waste to China.\nJanez Potočnik, a former European environment commissioner and the co-chair of the UN Environment Programme international resource panel, said the world needed to learn to do more with less and replace ownership with sharing, as is increasingly being seen with cars.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\nHowever, the Bank of England governor added that some of the leading thinking on climate crisis was coming from the US financial sector and tech companies. Christiana Figueres, a former top climate change negotiator for the UN, said at the same meeting that despite Trump’s attitude, there was still a chance the US would meet its carbon reduction targets because of initiatives at local and state level.\nCarney has been made Boris Johnson’s special adviser for the crucial COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November – an event as big in scale as the annual WEF event in Davos.\nHe said Johnson understood the challenge but that success in Glasgow was about mobilising private finance as well as action by governments.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nAdvertisement\n“The prime minister is very focused on this. The full weight of the government will be engaged with it.”\nCarney said public opinion had shifted on the climate crisis, while banks and the finance sector more generally were now aware of the risks and opportunities involved.\n“There will be companies who will be out in front and those who lag behind,” he said. “It is not simply a question of green good, everything else bad.

When we arrived at the campsite, we were asked not to smoke, and told firmly that no fires of any kind could be lit, owing to the forest fires that had been raging from the Arctic Circle to the Baltic Sea.\nLater that day, we received emergency notifications on our phones. Several more fires had broken out all over the country. I slept uneasily that night – and not only because I was on a yoga mat besieged by midges. It was my first experience of living with the climate crisis as a low-level but present danger.\nThis unease is now very familiar to most of us, and has been heightened by what we’re seeing in Australia. Since the fire season began there, in the middle of last year, 29 people have died, along with more than a billion animals, and an area comparable in size to the whole of England has been ablaze. It’s a vicious reminder that, for all the sophistication of the modern world, something as primitive as fire can still bring us to our knees. As shocking as the scale of the destruction has been, though, it’s easy to see it on our computer screens here on the other side of the world, in the middle of a British winter, and feel disconnected from it. We accept that the climate emergency is now truly upon us yet still feel that it’s mostly happening to other people, elsewhere.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBut wildfires are increasingly a problem for everyone, including in the UK. Last August, there were almost five times as many of them around the world as there had been the previous August. In the EU, the number of wildfires in the first half of 2019 was three times the annual average for the previous decade. And while they used to be a serious problem only in hotter, southern European countries such as Portugal and Spain, now northern Europe is in trouble too.\nThe Swedish fires of 2018 were by far the most severe in the country’s history, burning an area almost twice as large as the worst previous wildfire, in 2014. In the UK, 2018 and 2019 were the worst two years on record for wildfires, particularly on moors in the north-west of England and parts of Scotland. One fire last year, at Marsden Moor in Yorkshire, destroyed almost three square miles of land. The damage is on a very different scale to the almost 30,000 square miles that have burned in Australia, of course, but this is still a development we can’t afford to ignore.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘In the UK, 2018 and 2019 were the worst two years on record for wildfires, particularly on moors in the north-west of England and parts of Scotland.’ A wildfire burns on Marsden Moor in April 2019. Photograph: Jon Super/Reuters\nAdvertisement\nAside from all the more immediate effects – the threat to humans, livestock and wildlife – the recent increase in wildfires has been linked to severe air quality problems. People living up to 62 miles (100km) downwind of fires in the Pennines in 2018 were exposed to toxic fumes. And as there is no sign of cooler weather in the years ahead, it is reasonable to expect more fires in 2020. The EU has now established a fleet of firefighting planes, and the European Forest Institute has warned that unless we take steps to protect the countryside – for instance, by planting less-flammable species and creating barriers to the spread of flames – emergency services won’t be able to prevent the rapid spread and firestorms that have characterised the Australian crisis.\nI tried to warn Scott Morrison about the bushfire disaster. Adapting to climate change isn’t enough\nGreg Mullins\nRead more\nThis isn’t all because of the climate crisis – changes to land use and increased urbanisation over several decades are also factors. Weather patterns are noisy data, and it’s difficult to attribute any single wildfire to the climate crisis. The scientific consensus, however, is that it is increasing the intensity and frequency of fire-conducive weather across the world.\nEven those fires that are eventually linked to human error, like a still-lit disposable barbecue, are increasingly likely due to warming temperatures. Hotter summers mean more barbecues lit in the first place. The climate crisis is going to change the way we behave in every aspect of our lives. And with the probability of another summer of extreme weather coming, we will need to adapt to new dangers that won’t just be on the other side of the planet but, quite literally, in our own backyards.\nIt’s not at all clear that we’re ready for what might be coming. There is still a cognitive jump yet to be made when those of us in Europe read about the fires in Australia, from mourning the destruction there to recognising that we face some version of the same threat. When we look at Australia, we’re not looking at the future that might await Europe. That future is already here.\n• Imogen West-Knights is a writer and freelance journalist\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In 2018, 60 workers died due to temperature extremes, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data on workplace fatalities.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThough the climate crisis is creating conditions where workers are facing hotter temperatures on a more frequent basis, there are no federal safety protections for workers in extreme temperatures, and only three states, California, Washington and Minnesota, have heat stress workplace protection standards.\nThe fatality was one of several over that decade suffered by telecommunications technicians on the job. According to the CWA, it was the last fatality since the union began pushing to include heat stress workplace standards in collective bargaining agreements.\n“Unfortunately these catastrophic events have to occur to get employer’s adequate attention,” said David LeGrande, now retired Occupational Safety & Health Director for the CWA. The CWA represented Robinson at Verizon at the time of the incident, and LeGrande was one of the leads involved with the union’s investigation of Robinson’s death.\nLeGrande said: “We are, to my knowledge, the first union that has negotiated protective language with employers. That has been carried out on a national basis.”\nVerizon did not respond to requests for comment.\nMore heat days\nAccording to projections conducted by the not-for-profit organization Climate Central, the number of dangerous heat days for 133 US cities, will increase from 20 a year on average in 2000 to 58 in 2050. A dangerous heat day is defined as one in which the heat index, accounting for heat and humidity, exceeds 104F (40C).\nKiller heat: US cities' plans for coming heatwaves fail to protect vulnerable\nRead more\n“Climate change means it’s only getting hotter, and workers are at exposure for all kinds of excessive heat,” Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman from California, told the Guardian.\nEarlier this year, she introduced the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act of 2019, which would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to issue and enforce standards to protect workers from heat-related risks on the job.\nChu said: “It all started when I was in the California state assembly. The United Farm Workers came to me about the situation with Asuncion Valdivia. He was a farmworker picking grapes for 10 hours straight when he collapsed in 105F temperatures.\n“Instead of having any kind of proper treatment for him, a supervisor told his son to take him home. They didn’t even call an ambulance. On the way home, the son saw his father foam at the mouth, fall over and die. So the son had to watch his father die of a preventable heat stroke.”\nIn the California state assembly, Chu authored a bill for the California division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/Osha) to enforce heat standard protections for outdoor workers, which passed in 2005, making California the first state in the US to mandate employers to provide workers with periods of rest, shade and adequate water while doing outdoor work.\nIn 2015, the state of California settled two lawsuits brought by the United Farm Workers.\n“Those called for greater protections for all outdoor workers in high heat temperatures and also called for establishing a mechanism where farmworkers can call us directly to report complaints to CalL/Osha,” said Marichel Meija, national field coordinator for the United Farm Workers Foundation. “We now have regular communications with Cal/Osha to ensure situations are investigated.”\nNow the United Farm Workers and several other organizations are pushing for similar standards to be enforced across the US. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1992 and 2016, 783 workers in the US died and more than 69,000 workers suffered serious injuries due to heat exposure on the job, though labor advocates argue the real numbers are even higher due to widespread under-reporting and employers misclassifying worker deaths as non-work-related.\n“We’ve had issues where workers are not classified as dying because of their job when we know that is the case,” said Rebecca Reindel, senior safety and health specialist at the AFL-CIO union federation. “With heat you’re running into a lot of vulnerable workers, immigrant workers, where employers will pass it off, say something else happened, and no one is following up and that person’s family don’t know their rights to get it classified as a workplace fatality.”\nHeat inspections decreasing under Trump administration\nAs workers in the US are facing workplace environments that are getting hotter, and experiencing extreme temperatures more frequently, critics say the Trump administration has refused to address the problem. In an April 2019 report, the AFL-CIO noted federal Osha’s inspections related to heat declined by 49% under the Trump administration’s first two fiscal years in office.\nAdvertisement\nMore than 130 organizations petitioned Osha in 2018 to develop federal heat standards, with Chu prompted by the agency’s inaction to introduce legislation in Congress.\n“This bill would have such a high impact for so many workers forced to work every day in conditions they can’t control,” said Reindel of the AFL-CIO union federation. “It’s a structure to identify the hazards. These programs are really good because workers are part of the process, and when workers are part of the process that’s when you get to the root of the problem.”\nAccording to an Osha spokesperson, the agency launches a heat awareness campaign annually the Friday before Memorial Day, has been educating employers and workers about the dangers of working in heat since 2011, and in 2017 helped update an app for heat safety. The agency did not respond to requests for comment on petitions calling the agency to enact federal heat safety standards.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

About 2,000 people responded saying they wanted to be considered for the assembly, and the 110 members were picked by computer.\nThey come from all age brackets and their selection reflects a 2019 Ipsos Mori poll of how concerned the general population is by climate change, where responses ranged from not at all to very concerned. Of the assembly members, three people are not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said.\nThe selection process meant those chosen could include climate deniers or sceptics, according to Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, which is running the assembly along with the Sortition Foundation and the e-democracy project mySociety.\n“It is really important that it is representative of the UK population,” said Allen. “Those people, just because they’re sceptical of climate change, they’re going to be affected by the steps the government takes to get to net zero by 2050 too and they shouldn’t have their voice denied in that.”\nQuick guide\nWhat zero emissions in 2050 would mean for the UK\nShow\nThe Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:\n• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.\n• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.\n• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\n• Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.\n• A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes.\n• 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.\n• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\nThe UK climate assembly differs from the French model in that it was commissioned by six select committees, rather than by the prime minister. Their views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee any of the proposals will be taken up by government.\nAllen said it was rare for members of a citizens’ assembly to get locked into dissent. She pointed to the success of the Irish citizens’ assembly in 2016, which helped break the deadlock in the abortion debate. “This climate assembly is going to come up with recommendations that are going to be really invaluable in highlighting public preferences,” she said.\nJim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, is one of four experts who will guide the members of the public in their decision-making. He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was “a hell of a job”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAs well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers’ Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views.\nThe key subjects to be considered will include transport, agriculture, domestic energy, and how consumerism is driving global heating. As well as policies such as bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040, the panel will consider technological solutions to cutting carbon emissions. Watson said many technological initiatives were surrounded by hype. “It is really important we get across [to the assembly members] not just that the option is x, but what the status of that option is in the world,” he said.\nThe assembly will meet for four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target.\nA spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. “However, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for.

Adapting to climate change isn’t enough\nGreg Mullins\nRead more\nKelly wrote: “Yet again, the truth is the exact opposite of the Alarmist narrative peddled in the media and swallowed, hook line & sinker by the naive and gullible.”\nBut Harrison, of the University of Reading, told Guardian Australia the study was about historical changes, and “not about the modern situation”.\nShe said: “The paper explicitly shows that climate warming intervals in the geologic record are characterised by more fire, all other things being equal, and thus demonstrates exactly the opposite to Mr Kelly’s claim.”\nShe said while it was correct that there had been a reduction in area burned, the scientists “provide an explanation for this in the very next sentence after the one [Kelly] quotes”.\n“Specifically, in many regions of the world, including Australia, human transformation of the landscape through the introduction of agriculture and infrastructure results in reduced fire spread and a reduced burnt area.”\nShe said a reduction in burnt area over the last 50 years “does not negate the fact that climate warming is going to lead to increases”.\nShe said that “landscape fragmentation” had been countering the impact of global warming on the spread of fires, but added “the number of large and intense fires has gone up”.\nIn her comment on Kelly’s Facebook post, she addresses Kelly directly, telling him his “reading of the science is partial”.\nHer comment reads: “The controls on fire are complex, but two things we know for certain are that other things being equal increased temperature lead to increased fires. Hence, since increasing atmospheric CO2 leads (amongst other things) to increased temperature, the ongoing climate changes we are experiencing will lead to increased fire.\n“It is, alas, not difficult to predict what will happen if politicians continue to take a partial and prejudiced view of the science. They will continue to ignore the fact that the evidence shows that, even if there has been a reduction in area burnt in the recent historical periods, there has been an increase in fire frequency and severity associated with human-induced climate change. And that the risk of catastrophic fires will continue to increase.”\nShe added: “As a scientist, my job is to tell you the facts. Your job is to act on them.”\nKelly has been prolific in his Facebook attacks on the “climate alarmist cult” and the “prophets of doom” in the past few weeks.\nIn the past 24 hours, Kelly has posted six times, attacking climate campaigners at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland as “prophets of doom”, promoting Donald Trump’s attack on alarmists, attacking environment activist group Greenpeace, and other posts claiming “fake climate news”.\nSenior government MPs have tried to distance themselves from Kelly’s views, after he gave an interview earlier this month on the UK’s Good Morning Britain show in which he was described as a “denier”.\nCraig Kelly interview: senior government MPs distance themselves after Piers Morgan lashing\nRead more\nWhile Australia continues to be devastated by bushfires, Kelly has launched angry attacks on climate scientists, often in all caps.\nOn 3 January, Kelly linked to a blog by a UK group known as Principia Scientific International, which has previously claimed that CO2 is not a greenhouse gas.\nResponding to Harrison’s comments, Kelly has given interviews defending his statement, and repeating his original points. On Facebook he called the study an “inconvenient fact for the climate alarmist cult” and said the responses to it had been “pathetic”.\nKelly wrote: “These researchers should be out their attempting to correct the harmful myth held by climate cultists – yet they appear too frightened to admit the facts of their own research.”\nIn defending his original post, he pointed to another study by Prof Stefan Doerr, who is currently the editor in chief of the International Journal of Wildfire.\nBut last week Doerr joined colleagues to carry out a “rapid review” of the science on bushfires, saying: “The fact that fires are increasing in areas within or near closed canopy forest is the key issue of concern. This is one of the land cover types where direct impact on societies is greatest.\n“It is also important to highlight that most studies predict increased lightning activity in a warming atmosphere, which further exacerbates wildfire risk.”\n• This article was amended on 22 January 2020.

He’s leading the most influential nation in the world and he’s actively working against global action to reduce emissions.”\nTurnbull became prime minister in September 2015 and led Australia during the first year and a half of Trump’s presidency, famously clashing with Trump over an Obama-era refugee swap deal in the first month.\nTrump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, a move Australia has refused to follow despite the presence of climate change deniers or sceptics in the ruling Liberal-National Coalition.\nIn the grip of an unprecedented season of bushfires, pressure has mounted for Australia to increase its emissions reduction targets or abandon the use of carryover credits for overperformance of Kyoto agreement targets.\nThe current Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, re-elected in May 2019, has so far resisted pressure to increase the government’s ambition, citing fears over economic cost and the possibility technology could help Australia reduce emissions without higher targets.\nTurnbull said “the fundamental problem that we face is that in too many places – the United States in particular and also in Australia – is that this issue of global warming, or global heating, has been turned into an ideological issue or values issue when it’s simply a question of physics”.\n“The more greenhouse gases you pump into the atmosphere, the more of the greenhouse effect you get, the warmer the planet gets,” Turnbull said. “The consequences we are living with – hotter, drier climate, longer and more droughts, fiercer and more fires.”\nTurnbull was also asked about former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd’s warning that the idea that the UK’s trade with commonwealth countries could make up for exiting the European Union was “utter bollocks”.\nAdvertisement\nTurnbull said he would “express it differently” but agreed that trade with Australia, Canada and other commonwealth countries was “not a substitute for the European Union”.\n“The problem that Britain faces today is simply this: that in an age of rising protectionism, the United Kingdom has chosen to walk out of the biggest free-trade area in the world,” Turnbull said. “Its economic prospects, its trade prospects now depend on cutting new and better deals with a whole range of countries, not least is the EU itself.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

We acted within hours and the decision was very clear.\n“It is a conflict in terms of us working with extractive resources industries and with thermal coal. That was a commercial decision by Greyhound but it clearly conflicts with what we believe is right for the Great Barrier Reef.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAndy Ridley, the chief executive of Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef.

Ridley said the foundation had been unaware of Greyhound’s contract with the Adani project until being contacted on Tuesday afternoon for comment.\n“We didn’t know,” said Ridley. “The challenge is that we had a good partnership [with Greyhound] and we strongly supported them as a means of transport because of its low footprint and that 40,000 [of their customers] gave us a dollar. We will miss that funding.”\nIn the internal email sent to Greyhound staff, the company had defended its decision by promoting its partnership with Ridley’s foundation.\nDe Waal wrote: “Greyhound could become one of many companies in the crossfire of the anti-Adani campaign.”\nAdani coalmine: Siemens CEO has ‘empathy’ for environment but refuses to quit contract\nRead more\nThe email revealed the company, which has more than 600 staff, had won a three-month contract “with an opportunity for extension” to move workers for construction firm BMD, which is building the mine’s railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point.\n“The project may create concerns to individual team members in light of the international political, environmental, social and economic debate about climate change under way in the media,” the email read.\nA seperate public relations plan prepared for Greyhound, also seen by Guardian Australia, had produced a series of potential questions that could be aimed at the company’s chief executive, and had offered media training to respond to them.\nOne question that De Waal should be prepared to answer, the PR plan said, was: “Surely you will resign as chairman of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef and/or Greyhound Australia given your conflict of interest?”\nGreyhound Australia said it had no comment on the decision.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Not even Scott Morrison's","paragraph":"W\nould the prime minister rule out protecting Australians from terrorism if it cost a single job? Would he promise that no nurse, teacher or other public servant would be sacked in pursuit of a budget surplus? Of course not. But when it comes to preventing dangerous climate change, the government whose policies closed the entire Australian car industry claims that every job is sacred. Yeah, right.\nThe one thing we can say with certainty about the coal industry is that, regardless of climate policy, automation will decimate coal communities in the coming decade. The coal companies sacked around half their workforce in the late 80s – the minute new technology let them – and the coal industry is gearing up to do it again. Adani promised its proposed Queensland coalmine would be automated “from pit to port” and the rest of the industry is publicly preparing for the same goal.\nBut while #ScottyFromMarketing loves to position himself as defending coal workers from climate activists, he is strategically silent when it comes to protecting those same coal workers from the ravages of automation. If the Coalition wanted to protect the jobs of those who currently work in the coal industry, they would ban the introduction of robot-driven trucks and trains in existing mines and ban the construction of new, highly automated mines in regions that have never mined coal. But they won’t, because supporting the coal industry has nothing to do with protecting the jobs of existing coal workers. Coal is about symbolism and the symbiotic relationship between the Coalition and the coal industry.\nScott Morrison's senior ministers discuss how to reposition climate policies\nRead more\nFresh from doing nothing to prepare for the worst bushfires Australia has ever seen, Scott Morrison’s latest inactivity revolves around doing nothing to prevent our already changed climate from heatingup even more. Now that pretending there’s doubt about the science of climate change doesn’t cut it, our spin-doctor-in-chief has moved on to feigning concern with the economy as his latest excuse for climate inaction.\nThe prime minister is under mounting pressure to match the net-zero emission targets for 2050 that’s supported by all Australian states (including New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia, with Liberal governments). And while he might not hold a hose when the bushfires are raging, there’s no doubt Morrison knows how to put a fire hose on his colleagues.\nMorrison might not hold a hose when the bushfires are raging, but he knows how to put a fire hose on his colleagues\nStep one is, of course, to shoot the messenger. While it’s usually scientists or environmentalists that cop abuse for speaking up against the federal government’s love affair with coal, Morrison didn’t miss a beat when he set out to mock and belittle the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean. Practice makes perfect.\nAdvertisement\nStep two is to pull out the straw man. Shutting the coal industry down overnight would be reckless and cause lots of pain for no real gain. The fact that no one, ever, has called for the shutdown of the coal industry overnight makes it a particularly hard fight to lose. But it distracts journalists for just long enough to move things along to step 3. Econobabble.\nIf we know one thing about the economy it’s that it changes so frequently and so unexpectedly that it is literally impossible to predict. But even though no economist can accurately predict what the exchange rate or unemployment rate will be in three years’ time, Australian governments have become expert in worrying about what the economy will look like in 30 years’ time.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nProtesters hold placards during a ‘Sack ScoMo!’ climate crisis rally in Sydney on 10 January 2020 as bushfires raged around Australia. Photograph: Paul Braven/AAP\nIt doesn’t matter whether it’s tax cuts, penalty rate cuts or climate policy. Australian politicians love to talk in detail about what the impact of their policies will be in 30 years’ time, rather than talk at all about the problems they are ignoring today. Peter Costello started it with his ridiculous fear campaign about “the costs of ageing”, but the Coalition, under Abbott and Morrison, plumbed new depths with their fear campaign aimed at anyone trying to save the planet.\nSaying that you accept the science of climate change but think preventing it is a bit expensive is like saying you accept the science of immunisation but then decide to only inoculate one of your three kids.\nClimate science told us long ago that our bushfires, hail storms, floods and cyclones were going to get a lot worse if we kept burning so much coal, oil and gas. Economics has told us all along that prevention is cheaper than cure, and that the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and the introduction of a carbon price would be good for the overall economy, good for the budget and good for the climate.\nStudy finds shock rise in levels of potent greenhouse gas\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nBut just as we replaced real science with climate denial, we have replaced real economics with dodgy forecasts and bizarre criteria like protecting every coal job for the next 30 years.\nLess than a year ago, Morrison promised the budget would be in surplus, wage growth would pick up and the economy would grow strongly. They were wrong about these things, not because they are stupid, but because no one knows what will happen to the economy in a year’s time – let alone in decades to come.\nWhich brings me back to that fire hose Morrison is trying to put on his Liberal colleagues who believe it makes more sense to try and prevent climate change than to use a term in government blaming others for it.\nWhen pushed on setting more ambitious emission reduction target, Morrison mounted his high horse to declare: “What troubles me is that there are plenty of people at the moment who will go out and make a glib promise about that and they can’t look Australians in the eye and tell them what it will mean for their electricity prices, what it will mean for their jobs.”\nWhether because of privatisation, outsourcing, offshoring, technological change, policy change or just plain bad luck, we should always be generous in helping people when they’re forced to make a new start.\nBut promising that our country won’t tackle climate change unless every single coal worker’s job is safe is not generous. It’s a cruel hoax designed to conceal climate inaction. No one job is worth saving at the expense of dangerous climate change.

There is particular concern among some conservatives about a possible shift to a net zero emissions target by 2050.\nThe government has undertaken to look at shifting to a net zero by 2050 commitment through the Pacific Islands Forum, but Morrison said this week that “people who make these commitments need to be able to tell people what it will cost them”.\n“We need to understand what that means – I mean, people can say that, but what does that mean for jobs? Now I can’t answer that question right now … But I’m concerned it wouldn’t be a good thing.”\nBut in a sign of the political challenge facing Morrison, moderate MPs in inner-city seats are at the same time pushing for more ambitious action, amid concern that climate change will be a hot button issue at the next election.\nOn Tuesday, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, talked up the government’s “overachievement” for emissions reduction, saying the government’s position was clear that Australia would only use carryover credits if needed.\n“The result of Australians overachieving on our 2012 targets and on our 2020 targets … means there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of the hard work of Australian families, households and businesses, and we believe that we should be given credit for that,” Taylor told Sky News.\n“We are ahead of the game and our targets are a floor, not a cap, they are not a cap on our ambition and we will continue to work hard to meet and beat those targets by 2030.”\nScott Morrison says the government is acting on emissions. Is it true?\nRead more\nAccording to the latest government projections of Australia’s emissions, Australia will only meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by between 395m tonnes and 462m tonnes by relying on 411m tonnes of carryover credits.\nThe trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said on Monday he wanted the government’s “ambition” to be achieving the emissions reduction targets without the need for carryover credits.\n“That’s got to be the ambition in terms of the way in which we seek, as a government, to be able to reduce our emissions and reduce Australia’s emissions into the future and applying all of those new technologies,” Birmingham said.\nMorrison this week smacked down the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, for suggesting federal Liberals were pushing the government to increase its ambition on emissions reduction and abandon the use of carryover credits.\nAdvertisement\n“Matt Kean doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he doesn’t know what’s going on in the federal cabinet [and] most of the federal cabinet wouldn’t even know who Matt Kean was.\n“We are dealing with our climate policies in the same way as we took them to the election … we will meet and beat our emission reduction targets,” Morrison said.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The company actively promotes bus travel as a less emissions intensive alternative to flying and driving private cars.\nConstruction work has begun on the Indian-owned Adani mine – one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia’s history, which will extract coal for export to power stations.\n“Servicing BMD is not Greyhound taking a stand on climate change or any other important environmental topic facing our nation and the world,” the email said.\n“Greyhound could become one of many companies in the crossfire of the anti-Adani campaign,” De Waal said in the email. “Thank you for being courageous in servicing the regions and customers that mean so much to our business.”\nStaff in Townsville, Emerald, Clermont, Belyando Crossing and Mackay would “play a role” in transferring workers, the email said.\n“You are entitled to your views and we respect them,” it said.\nEmployees were asked to “utilise the internal communication channels rather than discussing sensitive business matters with external parties”.\nIn a Q&A section of the email, the company told staff it had “decided to be courageous” in taking the contract.\nInstructions were provided to staff “if you are approached by media or protestors”, asking them to “stay calm”, to refer people to Greyhound’s head office, and then to “walk away and go to a place of safety” before contacting a manager “immediately”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nDefending the company’s environmental credentials, the email said the company wanted to “transition to electric vehicles on reef routes”.\nThe email noted that De Waal is the chairman of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a conservation group led by Andy Ridley, a co-founder of Earth Hour, and promoted by Alan Jones at its launch in 2016. Ridley joined as chief executive in 2017 and relaunched the project with “the climate crisis as a focus”.\nThe email said the company was the foundation’s “eco-friendly travel partner” and more than $40,000 had been raised for the foundation by offering customers the option of an extra dollar cost on their tickets.\nRidley told Guardian Australia the foundation was “not aware” of Greyhound’s contract with BMD.\nHe said: “We have a clear ethical charter and for Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef – it’s critically important that we follow that charter. I need to look and check this immediately.”\nGuardian Australia has also seen a report prepared by a public relations company advising Greyhound on how it should handle its association with BMD and the Adani mine.\nThe report included the text of the email written by De Waal, saying “Greyhound Australia must be conscious this update could be forwarded to activists and the media”.\nThe company’s messages should have “three pillars” that refer to supporting local employment, “delivering environmentally friendly and safe services” and “supporting regional communities”, the report said.\nSeveral major companies associated with the controversial coalmine have been targeted by campaigners.\nBillie Tristram, 14, is a climate change campaigner who has helped organise school strike marches in Townsville.\n“We travel to school camps using Greyhound buses – a lot of schools use them. [Greyhound] is putting economics first instead of the environment. It’s like a slap in the face. I won’t be travelling with them until they back out.”\nIn January, the German technology company Siemens said it would honour its Adani contract after carrying out a review.\nIn December, the engineering firm GHD ended a 10-year association with Adani after that company was also targeted by campaigners.\nNew coalmines in Queensland don’t help existing communities, they hurt them\nRichard Denniss\nRead more\nJulien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, a group that tracks the relationships between corporations and fossil fuel industries, said Greyhound was now being placed on its “Adani list” of contractors associated with the mine.\nHe said the company’s email suggested it was aware of the “reputational risk” of being associated with the project.\n“This is not to let any other fossil fuel projects off the hook, but we are drawing a line in the sand [on Adani].”\nIn a statement, Greyhound verified the email and its contents, and said its Greyhound Resources business had been operating for more than 10 years in Queensland’s Bowen basin and in Gladstone.\n“Greyhound’s work in the resources sector reduces companies’ overall carbon footprint,” the statement said.\nThe company said it had not yet been targeted by anti-Adani campaigners.\n“We want our team to be safe and secure while delivering a transport solution that takes light vehicles off the road and provides safe transfers for workers from towns and cities to camps and site.”\nAsked if the company anticipated criticism from young people who used their services, the statement said: “All generations can make appropriate ethical choices in contributing to lessoning their carbon footprint on this planet.\n“Greyhound is not only a comfortable and scenic way to travel, it is the most carbon efficient per person for long distances.

Because who, after all, doesn’t like trees?\nWEF is launching its 1T.org initiative at Davos on Wednesday, aiming to use the restoration of nature to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises. It is estimated that the planet is losing 10bn trees a year, and large-scale projects to restore and replant forests are needed.\nTo make a real impact, however, tree fans must take on some of the biggest vested interests on the planet. Fossil fuel businesses are rightly regarded as the main culprits in rising global emissions, but the food we eat, clothes we wear and stuff we use takes a heavy toll on the world’s forests and peatlands, and therefore the planet’s ability to absorb carbon, as well as devastating species loss. Corporate commodity supply chains are responsible for about four-fifths of the loss of tropical forests across Asia, South America and sub-Saharan Africa.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe big question for tree supporters is whether they are willing to address the root causes of deforestation as well as replanting degraded areas, and whether they can couple this with the massive reduction in carbon emissions required from energy, transport and industry. As Greta Thunberg responded at Davos: “Planting trees is very good of course, but it is nowhere near enough.”\nTrump’s own record on environmental issues does not suggest a willingness to take on those vested interests, and his withdrawal from the UN’s Paris climate agreement – which pledges to keep global heating below 2C, and 1.5C if possible, and for the first time requires all nations to make a contribution to curbing emissions – is the most climate-wrecking of all his international moves.\nAs giant redwoods that have stood for millennia topple over in California as a direct result of the climate crisis, we should remember that replanting them is not an option. If Trump wants to protect them, he will need to address the US role in the climate crisis – and that starts with meeting the Paris goals, not running from them.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation. In service of the escalating climate emergency, we have made an important decision – to renounce fossil fuel advertising, becoming the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\nIn October we outlined our pledge: that the Guardian will give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand.

However, as always, the devil is in the detail. We need to see how this is implemented in practice and how this impacts lending to carbon-intensive sectors.”\nGlobal emissions must fall by 7.6% every year from now until 2030 to stay within the 1.5C ceiling on temperature rises that scientists say is necessary to avoid disastrous consequences.\nGreenpeace hits out at Davos banks for $1.4tn climate hypocrisy\nRead more\nGreenpeace this week shamed some of Lloyds’ rivals including Barclays, which it says is among the top 10 global banks providing $1tn (£766bn) of the financial support for fossil fuel firms. Barclays is also being urged to stop offering loans to fossil fuel companies as part of the first ever shareholder climate resolution aimed at a UK bank.\nCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “While it is significant that Lloyds have pledged to reduce the climate impacts of their lending, and forms part of a growing trend among financial institutions, we need all banks to change their dirty habits.”\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nBarclays has said it is “determined to do all we can to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met”.\nThe Bank of England is set to hold the first ever climate stress tests, which will force the UK’s largest lenders to report how exposed they are to the climate crisis and how they would respond to temperatures rising by up to 4C. The central bank has warned that drastic environmental damage could hit financial institutions by reducing asset values, lowering profitability and raising the cost of underwriting insurance losses.\nAdvertisement\nLloyds is among eight UK lenders set to go through the exercise.\nAntónio Horta-Osório, Lloyds’ chief executive, said: “The next decade will be crucial for protecting the planet for future generations, and financial services has a critical role to play.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\nWas this helpful?\nAdvertisement\n“Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour,” Thunberg said. “And we’re asking you to act as if you love your children more than anything else.”\nThe US president and Thunberg did not meet face to face at the WEF, but Trump left few in doubt about who he was referring to as he defended his record since entering the White House three years ago.\n“This is not a time for pessimism,” he said. “This is a time for optimism. To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers.\n“They want to see us do badly, but we don’t let that happen. They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s.

We don’t need to lower emissions. Emissions need to stop.”\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nThunberg had three demands for her Davos audience:\nThe halt of all investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments.\nAn immediate end to all fossil fuel subsidies.\nAn immediate exit from fossil fuel investments.\n“We don’t want it done in 2050, 2030, or even 2021, we want it done now,” Thunberg said. “You might think we’re naive, but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals, and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she said.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nShe then added that the right, the left, and the centre of politics had all failed the sustainability test. “No political ideology or economic structure has managed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency and create a cohesive and sustainable world.”\nJennifer Morgan, Greenpeace’s executive director, said: “The 1tn trees initiative didn’t make up for the lack of a wider attack on the climate emergency, and Trump had failed to appreciate the scale of the crisis.\n“To assume you can have a great, profitable America, and happy Americans without understanding the risk to Americans from climate change is astounding. It just demonstrates the level of denial, and the capture of this government by the coal, oil and gas industries.”\nTrump said the American dream was back, “bigger, better and stronger” than before, adding that the benefits of growth were going primarily to low-income workers rather than the better off. Trump added that 7m jobs had been created and 12,000 factories opened during his presidency.\nMany of the president’s claims were rejected by the Columbia University economics professor Joseph Stiglitz. “Research shows that Trump normally tells five or six lies a day. He far exceeded that today,” he said, noting that growth had been faster under Barack Obama than it was currently under Trump, and that life expectancy had fallen every year of his presidency.\nAlthough the US economy grew far more rapidly in previous decades than it has since he was elected in November 2016, Trump said: “I’m proud to say that the US is in an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before.”\nThe main hall in Davos, together with an overspill room, were packed to hear the president, although there were some titters as he ran through a litany of boasts.\n“I hold up the American model as an example to the world,” Trump said, contrasting his record with that of his predecessor, Obama.\nThe US was “thriving, flourishing and winning” unprecedentedly, he added, citing trade deals signed last week with China and Mexico-Canada as models for the 21st century.\n“I am looking forward to a tremendous new trade deal with the UK,” Trump said, noting that Britain had a “wonderful new prime minister” in Boris Johnson, who was keen on a deal.\nThe president said the economic boom had happened despite the US Federal Reserve, which “raised rates too fast and cut them too slowly”.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This would have been a big win for climate.”\nScientists say the fact they found emissions had risen is a puzzle and could have implications for the Montreal protocol, an international treaty that was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer.\nKieran Stanley, the lead author of the study, said that although China and India were not yet bound by the agreement, their reported reduction would have put them on course to be consistent with it.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,” he said. “However, without additional measurements, we can’t be sure whether India has been able to implement its abatement programme.”\nHFCs were hailed as an answer to the hole in the ozone layer that appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols that depleted the thin layer of ozone that protects Earth from harmful rays from the sun.\nBut in recent years there has been mounting concern at how the potent greenhouse gas was undermining efforts to keep global heating below dangerous levels. Scientists say one tonne of HFC-23 emissions is equivalent to the release of more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\nExperts estimate that had the HFC-23 emissions reductions been as large as reported, the equivalent of a year’s worth of Spain’s CO2 emissions would have been avoided between 2015 and 2017.\n• This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because HFC-23 is not used in inhalers, as an earlier version wrongly said.

Financial and economic concerns have been shunted down the list of priorities in favour of five environmental issues: climate breakdown and extreme weather; failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change; human-made pollution; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.\nGreen campaigners and social and human rights activists have been raising concerns on all of these for more than two decades, but it seems that finally the world’s powers are paying attention. In some cases it may be too late to act to avoid the consequences of the delay in taking action.\nAdvertisement\nSince 2015 when the landmark Paris agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen a further 4% and although there are signs the rate of increase may be slowing, that is nowhere near enough. Oceans are at the hottest ever recorded.\nLast year, ecological scientists said 1 million species were on the brink of extinction. The biomass of wild animals on the planet has fallen by more than 80%, about half of the area of key natural ecosystems has been lost, and insect populations have crashed, according to the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that by 2030 the world must be on track or exceeding 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels would be all but inevitable. Warming has already topped 1C and 2019 was the second hottest year on record.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAs the Davos agenda shows, businesses are taking note. Ashim Paun, the global co-head of environmental, social, and governance research at HSBC, said: “Will 2020 be an inflexion point? Our investor clients increasingly think climate change is absolutely core to their investment processes. So this year we look to major political and policy developments – the details of the EU green deal in March, the outcome of elections, particularly the US where we see the outcome as fairly binary for climate, and whether this year’s climate talks in Glasgow [in November] can regain previous momentum.”\nThere is plenty that all people around the world can do to get involved and shape the direction of this crunch decade. “2019 proved that activism works,” said Richard George, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “The amazing contributions from the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion, along with many others, got us a net zero target [in the UK and other countries], and almost universal agreement that not only is climate change happening but action to stop it is both vital and urgent. What we need now is real action to get the carbon out of our energy, transport, food and finance sectors, which means turning up the heat on politicians and corporations. This is the year to do it.”\nAdvertisement\nThere will be international conferences this year on the climate, the oceans, biodiversity, deforestation and a host of other pressing environmental concerns. Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction.\nHere’s what to look out for in 2020.\nClimate\nNearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year’s UN climate conference in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries’ commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a disastrous 3C rise.\nThat makes this year’s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to COP26 in Glasgow in November armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success.\nUS presidential election\nTrump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been baleful on climate action: he started the formal process to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the presidential election on 3 November. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role.\nTrump will also preside over the G7 meeting in June, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8’s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing.\nOceans\nPlastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a crisis in the oceans. The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”.\nBiodiversity\nAdvertisement\nEcosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating.\nTwo meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species.\nA series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress – or the lack of it – on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference.\nSustainable development goals\nThe Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the UN sustainable development goals, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills – including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July.\nBusiness\nThe last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder.\nTransport and the climate emergency\nGlobalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency’s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century – a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda.\nDeforestation\nAdvertisement\nIn 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference.\nEU green deal and China EU summit\nThe new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions.\nThe EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world’s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

He wrote: “We have waited a long time for a play that dealt comprehensively with climate change. Steve Waters has generously provided two.”\nThey were directed by Michael Longhurst and Tamara Harvey, now in charge of the Donmar and Theatr Clwyd respectively and both keen for them to be seen by a wider audience.\nAdvertisement\nLonghurst said it felt at the time “that we were breaking through with something, that it was a major piece of work … an epic pair of plays that were really putting the subject on the agenda in an exciting and engaging theatrical form – and doing that possibly for for the first time. I think the credibility of those plays has stood up since.”\nThey have asked Waters to update the works, looking at the science and political context.\nOne of the plays, On the Beach, features a glaciologist who has been studying an iceberg called Pine Island that was then melting swiftly. “It’s gone now, it’s just gone,” Longhurst said.\nThe Guide: Staying In – sign up for our home entertainment tips\nRead more\nBoth theatres will also work with Julie’s Bicycle, a nonprofit organisation that works within the creative industries, to ensure the coproduction is made sustainably.\nThe revival was announced as part of Longhurst’s second season as artistic director of the Donmar.\nOther productions include Suzan-Lori Parks’ In the Blood and the world premiere of an adaptation by Tim Price of Ruben Östlund’s film Force Majeure, which features skiing and an avalanche.\n“It feels utterly impossible to put on the stage but that became the appeal of it,” said Longhurst, who will direct. “Ultimately it is a close-up, forensic look at a marriage imploding and it will be brilliant.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

We will blame our governments for their inertia on climate change, our firefighters for not burning enough or burning too much and those leftists for their flagrant use of green tape.\nBut there isn’t a single culprit or a simple solution to a problem which has been heading towards catastrophe for decades, if not centuries.\nWe are all culpable, either directly through our land use practices, or indirectly through the land use practices and emissions that our often-thoughtless consumption necessitates.\nLike many of my ecologist colleagues, I dread the reaction to these events almost as much as the events themselves. The call for clearing country around infrastructure is already being taken up. And maybe this is part of the solution, but how many wounds can we inflict upon our planet and still expect her to maintain our climate, our air and our water?\nRight fire for right future: how cultural burning can protect Australia from catastrophic blazes\nRead more\nAs a Country Fire Authority volunteer, my mother has been working incredibly hard for some time to plan a buffer zone around Mallacoota that balances the locals’ love for their environment with their need for protection.\nThe plan never had a chance to be enacted. Imagine her heartbreak as she fielded 000 calls in the communications room of the Mallacoota fire station as the houses of her friends were burning. At the end of the smoke and drama that my mother is living through, and after a cold champagne in salute of survival, her mind will once again turn to protecting her community.\nBut I worry that that same community may never again be allowed the space to calmly consider its priorities amid the barking for more clearing and more burning to ensure safe communities.\nAdvertisement\nThe conversation that we need to have to address this deeply complex problem must be given the time and space it demands and it must be approached with open minds. Most importantly we must remain civil to each other, consider carefully each other’s expertise, experience and values and finally avoid the temptation of accepting poorly considered kneejerk reactions that will inevitably fail our planet, our ecosystems and our communities.\nWe need to acknowledge some truths along the way. Climate change is upon us, we must act to reduce its impact. Equally, we need to comprehend that the impact of climate change will be with us now for decades, even if, as a global community, we immediately begin to take meaningful and substantive action. So, where else must we turn our gaze?\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nTalking to my father recently in a break from his firefighting duties at Gipsy Point, his frustration was palpable. We discussed the inadequacy of land management practices that have contributed to the catastrophe which continues to threaten not only his community and the country of his heart, but also the sacred places of our mob.\nI’ve heard similar voices of frustration raised before from affected communities when I’ve been deployed to fires including at Wye River in 2015 and this year in south-west Victoria. Are our land management practices failing us so regularly despite the efforts of our firefighters to continually improve their fuel management programs?\nPerhaps what we lack is not a program of land clearing and ramped up fuel reduction burning. Perhaps what we lack, and desperately need, is a vision for our environment, for the species and ecosystems it will support, and how our communities will sit within these environments.\nWithout this vision I fear fuel reduction burning will simply condemn our landscapes to a patchy state of recovery from a series of wildfires and hazard reduction burns.\nThere’s already a blueprint for how we could remake our landscapes, it’s in our country’s bones. It’s in the stories and sophisticated land management practices of our first peoples. We could raise this vision again, a vision which supported the healthy soils and biodiversity that were inherited by European settlers 232 years ago, a landscape which saw fewer destructive bushfires.\nIt would mean we must have an honest and respectful conversation with the knowledge-holders of Aboriginal communities so that we can all understand the lore by which country was managed.\nI tried to warn Scott Morrison about the bushfire disaster. Adapting to climate change isn’t enough\nGreg Mullins\nRead more\nEight years ago, I started a fire program with colleagues on Cape Otway. The ecosystem we were working with was suffering the stark consequences of neglect, following a contact period which had catastrophic consequences for the Indigenous population.\nFortunately, we had a relatively good description of what the environment looked like under the custodianship of the Gadabanud from settler diaries, a lightly wooded rolling dune system with a diverse yet open understorey. We knew that fire had a role to play in restoring this landscape, although the complexity of the knowledge was not available to us.\nWe’ve made many mistakes in attempting to recreate this environment, most often through my failure to account for the attributes of certain plants. But, slowly, what we can see emerging in our landscape through the use of fire, is the structure of an open woodland that is rich in plant species once more. It’s less hazardous now because we’ve changed the fuel structure, although it is certainly still flammable.\nMost importantly though, this process has given us a glimpse at what this ecosystem has been and could be again.\nI know this approach won’t be an end to catastrophic bushfires in our rapidly changing climate as it’s not the only piece to the puzzle. However, we do know that through respectful and highly skilled use of fire, this country’s first peoples produced food, fibre and medicine for a large population while protecting communities, totems and places of cultural significance.\nThis was achieved by a society whose term of custodianship straddled periods of significant climatic change, making it an adaptive land management approach that we cannot afford to ignore now. Above all else, this was a knowledge system that provided a vision for our landscapes that doesn’t need revival, simply our attention.\nJack Pascoe is the research manager at the Conservation Ecology Centre, a fire practitioner and Yuin man.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The report, called It’s the Finance Sector, Stupid, also shows how some major insurers and pension funds that flock to Davos each year are key supporters of polluting industries such as coal.\nThe data was compiled from BankTrack, an organisation that monitors the financial sector. It shows that JP Morgan, the Wall Street investment bank, has provided $195bn of financial support to fossil fuel companies since 2015. JP Morgan declined to comment on the report.\nJennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International’s executive director, said the WEF’s mission statement is to “improve the state of the world” but the banks cited in the campaign group’s report are falling short of this goal.\n“The banks, insurers and pension funds here at Davos are culpable for the climate emergency. Despite environmental and economic warnings, they’re fuelling another global financial crisis by propping up the fossil fuel industry,” said Morgan. “These money men at Davos are nothing short of hypocrites as they say they want to save the planet but are actually killing it for short-term profit.”\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nTen top banks provided around $1tn of the financial aid for fossil fuel firms, the report said. They are JP Morgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America, RBC Royal Bank, Barclays, MUFG, TD Bank, Scotiabank, Mizuho and Morgan Stanley.\nA Barclays spokesperson said: “We recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today, and are determined to do all we can to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met. In 2018 we facilitated £27.3bn in social and environmental financing across our business including green bonds and renewable financing.”\nGreenpeace is also concerned that three major pension funds — the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and PensionDanmark — hold investments worth at least $26bn in major fossil fuel companies.\nSome financial companies have made encouraging noises about addressing the climate emergency, after seeing rising public concern and an escalation in extreme weather events. They cite initiatives such as green bonds, and a UN-backed “principles of responsible banking” initiative.\nLast week, asset manager BlackRock announced it would put sustainability at the heart of its active investment model. The announcement represented a major shift for the world’s biggest fund manager, although BlackRock’s huge “passive” investment arm will continue to invest in fossil fuel firms through tracked funds, for example.\nVincent Manier of ENGIE Impact, which advises companies on sustainability goals, said he believed investors will be forced to take the issue more seriously.\n“What we can take away from BlackRock’s move is that investors that don’t integrate climate risk assessments into their overall portfolio management processes are not capturing the full risk profile of their investments. The onus is on companies to demonstrate that they have a holistic understanding of all risks facing their business, disclose them and are developing plans to mitigate those risks,” Manier said.\nThe climate emergency is a major issue at Davos this year. Klaus Schwabb, WEF’s founder, has written to attendees asking them to make their companies carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest.\nClimate activists are demanding faster progress.

As an older, active member of Extinction Rebellion and of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion, this absolutely has not been my experience. Retired colleagues and I have regularly shared ideas and actions with young people and learned together how to take the movement forward.\nAn example: at a recent Reforesting Scotland gathering, one of the workshops was on XR and how a group of 70, mainly young, XR activists had responded to a call for volunteers and joined experienced foresters to plant trees at Gameshope, a Borders Forest Trust rewilding project in the south of Scotland.

It read like armageddon. CNN founder Ted Turner handed me the report as my job description. I wasn’t a film-maker – I began as a photojournalist for NBC, capturing social issues in 70s New York – but he preferred that I learned to make films than for him to find another producer who understood the environmental crisis we were facing.\nCaptain Planet is a metaphor for international cooperation with a penchant for bad puns and 60s music. Not unlike the UN\nTed called me into his office and said: “Captain Planet.” “What’s that, sir?” I asked. He said: “That’s your problem.” And my problem it was.\nWe lifted the characters and locations from environmental documentaries I had made with Nick Boxer. The Planeteers and many of the characters were based on real people. The world didn’t need another male macho superhero, so we made Captain Planet the quintessential antihero. He can’t exist without the combined powers of the Planeteers. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, called them together when the degradation of the planet became too dire for her to bear.\nEach Planeteer controls a power of nature: earth, wind, fire, water – and heart. Heart is the most important power, as without it there can be no compassion. Captain Planet himself is a metaphor for international cooperation, with a penchant for bad puns and 60s music. Not unlike the UN.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAdvertisement\nNever in our wildest dreams did we think our over-the-top storylines would come true. In one episode, Planeteer Wheeler renounces his powers and visits a future where flooding and food shortages are the new normal. We set it in 2025, but it is already happening.\nThe show became a global phenomenon: people recognised their countries and their neighbours. The merchandising was hard for me to stomach, but business does what business does. Captain Planet’s image was prohibited on single-use products. The action figures were made from plastic scrap and only recycled paper was used.\nUN draft plan sets 2030 target to avert Earth's sixth mass extinction\nRead more\nOur goal was to arm a generation with the knowledge to find more sustainable ways of living on the planet. The millennials are living proof that it worked. These adult Planeteers are growing into positions of power, bringing their knowledge to bear to make the changes we need.

They asked me to perform a scene where Captain Planet gets washed clean of toxic goo. I made a “dog shake” sound before I said my line, and got the gig.\nI later discovered I’d replaced Tom Cruise, who had already recorded the first five episodes. Everyone on the voice cast was grateful to be associated with the project, and worked for minimum wage. This seemed amazing to me given some of the A-listers I recorded with: Jeff Goldblum, Meg Ryan, Malcolm McDowell … Whoopi Goldberg, who voiced Gaia, brought in her Oscar (best supporting actress for Ghost) for us to play with.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDavid Coburn.

The show was very prophetic in many ways, and it’s alarming that the knowledge that fed into it has been ignored for so long. But I do think the conversation is changing now. Younger people are becoming more vocal and doing the job that we adults have neglected. I wrote to Greta Thunberg recently: if she’s reading this, Captain Planet would love to help out.\nWhen production ended, I wrote to Al Gore, inspired by his documentary An Inconvenient Truth. I’d dreamed of seeing environmentalism incorporated into the school curriculum. Children are the only demographic on the planet who aren’t motivated by profit.\nI was in New Zealand once for a commercial shoot, and encountered an environmental rally. Somebody had a Planeteers poster over his head, so I asked him how he knew the show. “Everyone knows Captain Planet, mate!” came the reply. I introduced myself – I had to prove I was for real by reciting my catchphrase, “The power is yours!” – and suddenly found myself on stage addressing 3,500 people while still dressed for the gym.\n• The Captain Planet Foundation is currently hosting Project Learning Garden 2020.

Is it true?","paragraph":"The prime minister says the Coalition is acting on emissions, meeting its targets and doing more than Labor did when in power. What’s the reality?\nScott Morrison says Australia’s emissions are coming down. Are they?\nNo.\nNational emissions peaked in 2007, the last year of the Howard government, came down each year under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, and have flatlined since the Coalition was elected in 2013.\nThis graph by Nick Evershed, Guardian Australia’s data and interactive editor, sets it out clearly.\nThe prime minister also says emissions are lower under the Coalition than under the Rudd/Gillard Labor governments. Is that right?\n(Specifically, that they are on average 50m tonnes less each year under the Coalition than Labor.)\nThis was not correct until last year, when the government released revised historic emissions data (as explained here). Since then, Morrison’s claim is roughly accurate.\nAdvertisement\nBut it is a meaningless statistic – a clear case of nonsense framing to mask what is happening.\nAustralia changed its historical carbon emissions data: what happened?\nRead more\nLabor can’t be held responsible for the historically high emissions level it inherited when it came to office, and pollution fell about 14% in the nearly six years Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were prime minister.\nThe ALP can’t take all the credit for the decline. The millennium drought, the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar all had some impact. But government policies, including the carbon price scheme introduced in partnership with the Greens and independents, had some effect.\nEmissions reductions stopped under the Coalition about the time the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014.\nThe most recent quarterly greenhouse data found rising pollution in most parts of the economy were offset by a significant fall in emissions from agriculture due to drought and floods – a shift that has nothing to do with the government.\nAre we “meeting and beating” our emissions targets, as Scott Morrison says?\nThis is where we risk getting buried in numbers, but bear with me.\nIt makes sense for governments to set emissions targets. How else to assess whether countries are playing their part in addressing a dramatically escalating global problem?\nBut the most important initial question about a government target, before asking whether it will be met, is whether it addresses the problem faced.\nAs far back as 1990, the Coalition went to an election under Andrew Peacock promising to cut emissions 20% by 2000.\nBut Australia’s first target under the Kyoto protocol, the initial climate pact signed in 1997, allowed it to increase emissions by 8% above 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nPut another way, the Howard government adopted a goal that allowed it to emit even more heat-trapping gas as part of an agreement under which developed countries were supposed to be cutting pollution.\nAs has been well ventilated, it was no accident that 1990 was chosen as the baseline year. There was a hell of a lot of land-clearing and deforestation that year, releasing a stack of carbon dioxide. As the graph above shows, emissions plummeted after 1990, largely because land management in Queensland changed.\nIt meant Australia had set itself a target that allowed it to not just increase pollution by 8%, but dramatically ramp up emissions from fossil fuels and other industry.\nAs this graph shows, that’s what happened. It leaves out emissions of what is known as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) – which are important, but have been used to muddy the picture – to show Australian pollution from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture and waste is up about 30% over three decades.\nAdvertisement\nSo, yes, Australia “beat” its first Kyoto target.\nIf it had used any year after 1991 as the baseline it wouldn’t have.\nAnd fossil fuel emissions – the primary driver of the climate crisis – have continued to rise.\nWhat about Australia’s 2020 target?\nAustralia’s 2020 target is usually described as a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020.\nAs analysts and politicians have pointed out, it is neither meeting nor beating that goal.\nGovernment data shows emissions are expected to be just 0.3% lower this year than at the turn of the millennium.\nGiven that, how can Morrison claim the government is beating its target?\nAgain, the wonders of greenhouse accounting.\nAs the ANU economist Stephen Howes explains, Australia’s 2020 target was expressed in more than one way. It was also listed with the UN as a 0.5% cut below 1990 emissions levels – that baseline year again – for the average of the years 2013 and 2020.\nUnder that complicated formulation, Australia will technically beat its 2020 target.\nBut it will still be putting the same amount of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere this year as it was 20 years ago.\nWhat is expected to happen to Australia’s emissions over the next decade?\nNot much.\nThe Department of the Environment and Energy projects that pollution will be only 4% lower in 2030 than today.\nIt expects that despite assuming that, due to the falling cost of solar panels and some state-based targets, renewable energy will rise to provide 51% of electricity in the national grid by then (a level that the government opposed as damaging to the economy at last year’s election).\nIf the department projections are correct, it means we will not have made a 5% emissions cut below 2000 levels by 2030, let alone 2020.\nWhat does that mean for Australia’s next target under the Paris climate deal?\nAdvertisement\nThat, despite Morrison claiming it will be met “in a canter”, the government is not on track to meet that either.\nBefore getting to the specifics, it is worth considering what was agreed in Paris, and what it means for Australia.\nThe headline goal of the 2015 pact was to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and trying to keep it as close to 1.5C as possible. Scientists say that means net zero emissions by about 2050.\nThat this is the implicit target of the Paris agreement is now broadly accepted across the engaged community. More than 70 countries say they are working towards that goal.\nIn Australia, a coalition of groups including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Energy Council issued a statement in December saying the country should adopting policies that put it on a path to net zero national emissions.\nEvery state, whether run by the Coalition or Labor, has a net zero emissions goal.\nThe Morrison government doesn’t.\nAsked by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell on Monday about a suggestion federal Labor would recommit to net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said he had “no idea what the Labor party is talking about”.\nPressed further, he acknowledged the government promised at last year’s Pacific Islands Forum, where Australia faced sustained criticism from island nations for its support of the coal industry, that it would consider it. But he stressed he was concerned that “it wouldn’t be a good thing” and did not think it should be adopted unless it was clear what it would mean for jobs.\nAustralia disregarded scientific advice in setting its initial, medium-term target under the Paris agreement. The then Abbott government was advised by the Climate Change Authority that Australia’s part under a meaningful global pact would be equivalent to a cut of between 45-63% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nIt instead opted for a 26-28% reduction over that timeframe.\nAgain, there was some fudging. Rather than stick with 1990 or 2000, the government opted for a baseline year that – as emissions were substantially higher in 2005 than in 2000 – made the proposed cut appear larger.\nIf the government had stuck with 2000 as the baseline, its Paris target would be a 16-18% cut.\nDepartment data suggests national emissions are expected to instead be 16% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of the minimum 26% goal. The government plans to make up the difference through another accounting measure: claiming credit for “beating” or, as it now describes it, “overachieving” its Kyoto targets.\nAdvertisement\nUsing what are known as Kyoto “carryover credits” is politically and legally contentious, and opposed by many countries at climate talks.\nCritics say Australia is still trying to claim credit for a 30-year-old land-clearing loophole that it used against targets that were already far lower than what scientists said was necessary.\nIs the Morrison government introducing new climate policies?\nNot so far. The government’s main climate policy remains the $2bn climate solutions fund, under which taxpayers pay businesses and land-owners to limit pollution, mostly by planting or protecting vegetation. Recent evidence suggests it is struggling to find people to sign up.\nIn October, the government quietly commissioned a review of the policy in what was seen as an acknowledgement that it was not delivering what was needed.\nThe Coalition supports some energy projects, particularly pumped hydro storage, and is promising a long-delayed electric vehicle strategy and a “technology investment roadmap”.\nMorrison says Australia is leading the world on renewable energy, and emissions from the electricity sector have fallen while those from other sectors increase. But spending on clean power fell 56% last year, and the government has rejected calls for an overarching policy to drive private investment.\nHow does Australia compare to other countries on emissions?\nAustralia is responsible for about 1.3% of pollution, but has only 0.3% of the global population. It is one of the top 20 emitting nations, releasing more than G7 members Britain, France and Italy.\nIt is also the third biggest exporter of fossil fuels and aims to expand the trade.\nSeveral analyses have found that, even by the inadequate standard of international action to address the climate crisis, Australia is performing poorly.\nScience and policy body Climate Analytics says it is expected to fall even further behind because, unlike comparable countries, it has no plan to introduce an effective national emissions reduction policy.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Identifying the problem, however, is not much use unless we also identify the appropriate tools to address it.\nIn my own field of specialisation, central bankers have caught climate-change fever. Under the leadership of Christine Lagarde, for example, both the International Monetary Fund and now the European Central Bank have declared the planet’s climate health to be “mission critical.”\nTo be sure, financial institutions must fundamentally rethink some things in the light of the climate crisis. For example, a bank or insurance company calculating risks to real-estate loans would make a serious mistake if it followed the standard methodology and plugged into its formulas the probability of a flood based on data from the past 100 years. Instead, it should take a forward-looking approach, which means using estimates of the increasingly elevated probability of such disasters.\nAdvertisement\nBut central banks and international financial institutions simply lack the necessary tools to have first-, second-, or maybe even third-order effects on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions.\nSo, what policy tools would have first-order effects?\nIn the US, the “green new deal” signals commitment to the climate cause. But I fear that the legislative proposal that its congressional supporters have introduced will do more harm than good. It includes extraneous measures such as a federal jobs guarantee. This proposal creates a factual basis for a lie that US climate-change deniers have long been telling: that global warming is a hoax promoted as an excuse to expand the size of government. That is a sure-fire way to generate votes for Trump in November.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nTechnological innovations in areas such as solar power certainly will play a big role in mitigation. But technology is not a policy. Subsidies are a policy. There is a case to be made that governments should subsidise research in climate science and relevant technologies. There is also a strong case that policymakers should allow free trade in solar panels, turbines and other equipment, to lower the cost of generating renewable energy at no cost to domestic taxpayers.\nBut the policy that will move us closest to achieving global environmental targets, such as those in the Paris climate agreement, at relatively modest economic costs, is to raise the price of emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If, for example, solar power or other renewables can in fact meet most of our energy needs at a reasonable cost, then a high carbon price will encourage that result. And if some other technology or approach is needed, the carbon price will reveal that as well.\nThe price of carbon can be raised via one of two policies: a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, that is, a system of quantitative emission limits with tradable emission permits.\nIn theory, the two approaches are equivalent: the quantity of carbon permits is calculated carefully, so that the resulting price when they are traded is the same as the price that would be achieved by the tax. In the real world, however, there are significant differences between regulating prices and quantities. The most important differences relate to uncertainty and political economy.\nFor starters, it would be great if policymakers could commit to a century-long rising path for the carbon price. People could then plan far ahead. Firms would know with certainty the penalty for building long-lasting coal-fired power plants. But, even assuming a miraculous burst of multilateral cooperation, today’s leaders cannot bind their successors 50 years into the future, which rules out precise certainty about the future price or quantity of GHG emissions.\nWhat is critical, though, is quickly to establish the expectation that the price of carbon will follow a generally rising path in the future. To achieve this, governments must start increasing the price today; lofty statements from public officials and optimal calculations from climate modellers will not do the job.\nPredicting political economy, meanwhile, is extremely difficult. In the climate-change arena, everything is judged to be “politically impossible,” and was even before Trump. Even so, at the global level governments are probably more likely to agree to quantitative emission targets – as in the 1997 Kyoto protocol and the 2015 Paris accord – than to a global carbon tax, which would be considered too severe an invasion of sovereignty.\nWhen it comes to the national implementation of any global effort to limit CO2 emissions, however, I lean toward a carbon tax over tradable emission permits. Previous attempts to introduce emission permits, such as the EU’s emissions trading system, have revealed a tendency to mollify industry by issuing more permits than originally intended and giving too many to legacy firms. The logic of doing so is to “make them whole,” but this can result in windfall gains when the firms sell the permits.\nIn any case, putting the price of carbon on an upward path, whether via a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, is the right tool for the job.\nObviously, no single citizen can expect to solve the problem of climate change alone. But whereas some individual actions are mainly symbolic, others can have an effect that is at least proportionate to the number of citizens undertaking them.\nFor frustrated young people, one piece of advice is clear: while going to a Greta Thunberg-inspired demonstration is fine, registering and voting is critical. If Americans aged 18-24 were to turn out and vote in the same proportions as older age groups, Trump would almost certainly not be re-elected. With Trump gone, the US could rejoin the Paris agreement and adopt effective measures to combat global warming – and other governments would lose an excuse they currently have to delay action.\n• Jeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government.

Congress must use its power to investigate","paragraph":"Greta Thunberg summed up 2019 in five words: “Our house is on fire.” In Australia, this is now literally the case.\nWildfires there have been raging for more than a month and now span an area larger than Switzerland. The situation bears all the hallmarks of a hot new world: lives lost, livelihoods ruined and species pushed towards extinction, accompanied by government inaction, industry PR spin, abetting rightwing echo chambers, and taxpayers footing the multibillion-dollar bill.\nInsanely, the Australian government remains in denial – ignoring the science, downplaying the seriousness and subservient to coal. The fossil fuel industry, meanwhile, is busy greenwashing and gaslighting: Chevron is boasting about its $1m donation – 0.00667% of its annual earnings – to the Australian Red Cross, and Exxon Australia just wants everyone to “Stay safe and have fun”. All this is set to a backdrop of mutually reinforcing rightwing new outlets, online bots and trolls, which are distracting and misinforming the public about the science and politics of climate-catalyzed fires.\nExxon has misled Americans on climate change for decades. Here’s how to fight back\nJohn Cook, Geoffrey Supran, Naomi Oreskes, Ed Maibach and Stephan Lewandowsky\nRead more\nThe charity of everyday people (and some celebrities) rising to meet the disaster has been inspiring and essential. Yet, tragically, it also unintentionally serves to reinforce the false narrative, perpetuated by fossil fuel propagandists, that we are all equally to blame.\nIn reality, today’s climate chaos is big oil’s legacy, not ours. Unlike the rest of us, the fossil fuel industry saw this climate chaos coming, then literally and figuratively added fuel to the fire, doubling down on a business model incompatible with the science of stopping global warming; buying political inaction; and building a global climate denial and delay machine that has confused the public and fomented distrust of science, media and government.\nIn October last year, the US Congress began to investigate this history. Before a packed audience at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled Examining the Oil Industry’s Efforts to Suppress the Truth about Climate Change, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the climate scientist Dr Martin Hoffert about his collaborative research with Exxon in the 1980s.\nPlay Video\n1:24\n'So they knew': Ocasio-Cortez questions Exxon scientist on climate crisis denial – video\n“So in 1982,” she said, referring to a recently uncovered internal company memo containing a graph of global carbon dioxide and temperature levels rising over time, “1982 – seven years before I was even born – Exxon accurately predicted that by this year, 2019, the Earth would hit a carbon dioxide concentration of 415 parts per million and a temperature increase of 1C. Dr Hoffert, is that correct?”\n“We were excellent scientists,” answered the former New York University physics professor, triggering laughter from the audience.\n“Yes, you were; yes, you were,” the congresswoman agreed. “So they knew.”\nThis was the first time that Congress – indeed, any legislative body in the world – had heard a firsthand account – from someone who was actually involved in the work – of just how much, and how early, the fossil fuel industry knew of the potential global warming dangers of its products.\nThe event showed how effective such hearings can be. In the space of a couple of hours, expert witness testimony (including by one of us) and thousands of pages of documented evidence entered the congressional record. Masterful questioning helped translate a key whistleblower’s knowledge into a viral C-Span moment.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nIt was just one hearing, but it had the makings of the tobacco industry investigations led by Representative Henry Waxman in the 1990s. He could just as easily have been speaking about fossil fuels when he described the purpose of that congressional oversight: “To build a public record and eventually create enough momentum in Congress and among the American public for legislation.”\nOur message to Congress after its first foray into investigating fossil fuels is this: keep going. Because big oil is the new big tobacco.\nInvestigative journalism and peer-reviewed research, including our own, clearly demonstrate that the fossil fuel regime has deliberately denied Americans and Congress their right to be accurately informed about the climate crisis, just as tobacco companies misled Americans about the harms of smoking. From strategy to networks to personnel to rhetoric, the fossil fuel regime’s efforts to deny and delay come straight out of big tobacco’s playbook.\nThe historical record is incontrovertible. As we summarize in a recent report, the fossil fuel industry’s own internal documents reveal that it has been studying CO2 pollution for more than 60 years. As early as the 1950s, it knew its products had the potential to change the climate. By the late 1970s and early 80s, Exxon scientists were explicitly aware that burning fossil fuels could lead to what they called “catastrophic” global warming. In 1986, an internal “greenhouse effect working group” at Shell concluded: “The changes in climate … may be the greatest in recorded history.”\nFor all the skeletons we have already found in big oil’s closet, we are still only looking through the keyhole\nBut instead of taking action or warning the public, fossil fuel interests stayed quiet. Then, in the late 1980s and early 90s, when global warming finally caught the world’s attention, the carbon majors sprang to action and took the low road, spending billions of dollars over the next 30 years on advertising and lobbying challenging science, slandering scientists and attacking policies to protect their profits. In so doing, they have undermined – and continue to undermine – Americans’ chances of a just and stable future.\nToday, the case for subterfuge is so strong that New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 14 US cities and counties have variously sued ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies for fraud, damages or denial. Maui and Honolulu have recently added their intentions to file lawsuits. In Australia, there are mounting calls to make polluters, not just taxpayers, pay for wildfire relief and climate mitigation.\nFor all the skeletons we have already found in big oil’s closet, however, we are still only looking through the keyhole. Tracking down a few hundred documents has allowed us to uncover some key cogs in the climate denial machine. Yet it is a sprawling, well-funded, well-oiled network that stretches far beyond ExxonMobil and the Kochs: a labyrinth of people and money connecting fossil fuel companies, utilities, ancillary manufacturers, trade associations, PR firms, advertising agencies, libertarian foundations, thinktanks, legal firms and individuals, all feeding an echo chamber of pundits, astroturf groups, blogs, media and, yes, politicians. Network analysis has identified at least 4,556 individuals and 164 organizations in the global web of denial. We believe the American public deserve to know the truth – and see the receipts – of these dealings that have already led to deaths, destruction and the injustices of a collapsing climate.\nClimate emergency: 2019 was second hottest year on record\nRead more\nThis is where congressional authority to request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas, comes in. Key breakthroughs in tobacco control came as congressional investigations – as well as legal discovery and industry whistleblowers – exposed thousands, and ultimately millions, of damning documents. The tobacco industry was found guilty of racketeering in part because of the ways that individual companies had coordinated with each other and with third-party allies to present false information to consumers. That history is a precedent for Congress to investigate an industry network that has misled the public and policymakers in an effort to deny the dangers of its products and derail regulation.\nAs the congressional scholar Morton Rosenberg recently testified in the Senate: “Congress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel production of information needed to discharge their legislative functions.”\nWe are not politicians or political strategists, so we do not presume to dictate how Congress exercises its investigatory powers. But as experts in the history of climate denial and global warming politics, it is our opinion that holding the fossil fuel industry accountable would be one of the most impactful ways for Congress – and governments around the world – to combat the climate crisis. Impeachment investigations understandably occupy much attention.

They are just one example from a long series of extreme weather events in 2019, including cyclones in India and Bangladesh that displaced more than three million people, Cyclone Idai, which killed more than 1,000 people in southern Africa, floods that displaced tens of thousands of people in Iran, and entire townships laid to waste by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas. The year ended with reports of record rates of Arctic ice melt that, through positive feedback effects, are likely to intensify climate heating and impact the future of humanity.\nIn the face of global catastrophe, it’s hard not to feel daunted. What can I, an individual, do to address such a crisis? Understanding that my daily actions are partly responsible for climate change, I feel a gnawing sense of sense of individual guilt.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s perhaps not surprising that I feel like this. I was a child of the 1980s and a teenager in the 90s: my formative years were during something like the most individualistic age in history. While I learned times tables at primary school, Margaret Thatcher was telling the nation there was no such thing as society. During my teenage years, product advertising and globalisation brought a new age of hyper-consumerism, as we were bombarded with education programmes to build self-esteem and TV shows such as Big Brother, The X Factor and The Apprentice, which all glorified self-aggrandisement in subtly different ways.\nDeveloping human minds are like sponges and ours were submerged in ever more individualistic language. Phrases such as “unique”, “personal”, “self”, “me” and “mine” were used with increasing frequency in lyrics, TV shows and books. This immersion took its toll: analysis of data from almost 80 countries shows how the majority have shown marked increases in individualistic attitudes over recent decades.\nHaving a strong sense of self can be useful, but excessive individualism has its costs. The more we see ourselves as discrete entities, the more likely we are to feel isolated and lonely and to show “selfish” behaviours. As a consequence, rates of anxiety and depression are rising across the world, while the climate and biodiversity crises deepen ever further.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAnxiety and depression are rising across the world … the village Dashtiari in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan region after flooding. Photograph: Alireza Masoumi/ISNA/AFP via Getty Images\nYet times are changing. In the last decade, we may have seen individualism peak. Scientific discoveries have revealed how the perception of a distinct self is an illusion. Our bodies are made from materials that were once parts of countless other organisms, from ancient plants to dinosaurs. Most of our 37tn cells are directed by a genetic code that is a shared heritage not just of humanity but all of life on Earth. You might think your life experiences define you, but the neural networks in your brain that encode these are changing constantly – you are not even the same person you were when you started reading this article. And the new science of social networks shows how we are linked together so closely that ideas, behaviours and preferences flow between us in a way that makes it unclear where one mind ends and another begins.\nAnd people are finding new value in being part of groups, whether it is through activism (Extinction Rebellion, youth strikes, political party memberships) or leisure activities (book clubs, festivals, park runs). New research shows that when people have a broader sense of group identity (for example viewing themselves as global citizens, rather than embracing nationalism), they tend to be more likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviours, such as reducing their carbon emissions, buying sustainably and volunteering. A new age of collectivism seems to be dawning – and not a moment too soon.\nAdvertisement\nSo what can be done to make people truly embrace being part of a group? In answering this question, it is worth bearing in mind that the evolutionary history of our brains means we are susceptible to certain biases. When populations face shocks such as environmental catastrophe or social unrest, they are more likely to strengthen bonds between their “in-group” members, while caring less about those outside of the group. This is a defence mechanism to help groups pull together and overcome hardship. Social research has shown that it operates at the country level, too – countries facing crises are more likely to show prejudice towards outsiders and elect authoritarian leaders. Environmental catastrophes are only expected to worsen under climate change, which means nationalism could grow purely due to this evolutionary bias. Yet, is this a sensible response?\nIn 2020, we live in a highly globalised world, with cross-border flows of money and people, as well as environmental impacts such as the climate crisis and air pollution. If we bond together within nations but with less regard for the welfare of others beyond those borders, we will end up fouling the global commons, ultimately to our own detriment.\nSign up for Bookmarks: discover new books in our weekly email\nRead more\nYet there is hope. New research shows how we can escape individualism. Outdoor community activities increase both our psychological connectedness to others and to the natural world. Escape cities to go for a walk with family or friends, or volunteer in a garden or park near you as often as you can. Meditation is proven to alter neural networks in the brain and reduce self-centredness, and solitary activities such as reading and playing computer games have been shown to increase empathy with others. We can all do something small to be part of something bigger and help solve our global problems. Let’s all get on with it.\n• Tom Oliver is professor of ecology at the University of Reading, and author of The Self Delusion, which will be published on 23 January.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Evidently, it was a lesson that the youngest MP to enter parliament at after last month’s general election took to heart. After all, not every 23-year-old’s nights out clubbing end with them trying diligently to unionise the staff. “Sometimes in the club toilets there are women selling deodorants or sweets. And I’ll go up to them and have a chat and just get to know them and ask whether they’re in a union,” explains the new Labour MP for Nottingham East, grinning. “My friends are always like: ‘Nadia, we’re going to get the shots in ...’ But politics is life, isn’t it? We live it every day.”\nLose yourself in a great story: Sign up for the long read email\nRead more\nShe is living it very differently these days, however. Almost overnight, Whittome went from living at home with her mum in Nottingham to representing her city in parliament and being grilled on the Today programme. Her election victory was a light on an otherwise dark night for the radical left. But it is a lot to take in for someone selected only 24 hours before the election was called and who had never lived away from home before she was elected (although she now has a flat in London for weeknights, she is still under her mother’s roof in her constituency). “People keep asking me how I feel, and the truth is there’s no time to process how I feel. I’m just getting on with the job,” she says. “It does feel really odd that, not very long ago, I was looking for Christmas temp work – got rejected from a lot of Christmas temp work – and now I’m a member of parliament.”\nThe so-called baby of the house has a certain steel about her. “I don’t want to start to feel comfortable in that place,” she says of parliament. “I’m not here to become part of the fabric of Westminster; I’m here to change it.”\nIf she seems unusually self-possessed for her age, perhaps it is because Whittome had to grow up faster than some. She turned to activism as a teenager, she says, after watching friends on her estate struggle to cope under Tory austerity measures. Before long, this daughter of immigrants – her mother, who raised her as a single parent, is British-Indian; her father is of Punjabi heritage – was protesting against the bedroom tax alongside Tony Benn and organising with Deliveroo riders against gig economy working practices.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘The individual policies of the manifesto were popular, but we hadn’t built support’ ... Nadia Whittome (bottom left) on the campaign trail in Nottingham with Jeremy Corbyn. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA Wire\nWhittome says she joined Labour under Ed Miliband because she wanted it to be an anti-austerity party; in 2015, she was an early cheerleader for Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to succeed him. Having run unsuccessfully for a local council seat, she beat stiff competition to be selected as the party’s candidate for the safe seat of Nottingham East after the incumbent Labour MP, the Corbyn critic Chris Leslie, defected to the short-lived Independent Group for Change. Whittome had been the official candidate for a day when Boris Johnson called the 2019 election.\nWhittome is from a politically engaged family: her grandparents belonged to the Communist party of India (which she stresses is different from the Communist party in Britain) and her mother quit the Labour party over the decision to amend clause IV in 1995. “I get a lot of my strength from my mum, but also the networks that we built around us,” says Whittome.\nHer mother is a social-care lawyer working in local government; she got her law degree as a mature student and was out of work for five years when Whittome and her brother were young. Originally, Whittome planned to become a lawyer, too – partly due to the feeling that “I have got to provide for my family when my mother can’t” – but she dropped out of university after two years for financial reasons.\nThat must have been tough, I say. But she insists she loved the jobs she got instead, as a care worker and a hate-crime project worker. “When I first stood for election, I was asked by people – white, middle-class academics: ‘When are you going to get a proper job?’ And I’d say: ‘I’ve got a proper job; I’m a care worker.’ It felt like a real privilege to be let into people’s homes and facilitate their lives. For a lot of people, you’re the only person they see all day.” She snorts at the argument that young people need more real-life experience before becoming MPs, pointing out that age is no guarantee of that: “Jacob Rees-Mogg is in his 50s and he’s never changed a nappy.”\nYet it is undeniably a steep learning curve, moving from anonymous activist with the freedom to say what you like to this merciless public stage. Whittome has already triggered a kerfuffle by tweeting, when Iain Duncan Smith was knighted, that she was “thinking of the millions of people whose loved ones have been killed” by his policies. Does she really believe welfare reform directly claimed millions, or even hundreds of thousands, of lives?\nWhat should have been a climate election was taken over by Brexit\nAdvertisement\n“Millions isn’t necessarily an overestimation,” she says. “There were, in 2017, 130,000 people who died avoidably due to austerity.” But the study I think she is citing, which examined the years 2012 to 2017, was not about welfare policy – it was about higher-than-expected numbers of deaths, which the authors suggested (but could not prove) reflected cuts in health spending. What evidence has she for this serious accusation against the former work and pensions secretary? “Specifically on welfare policies, we don’t know how many people have died as a result of universal credit. We know that people have died due to austerity.” All right, but that is not what she tweeted.\nHowever, Whittome’s convictions are not easily shaken. “The bigger problem is that we are talking about ‘Is it tens of thousands, is it hundreds of thousands?’ – it’s certainly not dozens – and ‘How many people do each of these people know?’, to ascertain exactly how many people are mourning and how many people have died. The fact that we’re having this conversation in the media, rather than actually dealing with the immediate issue, is sad.” To Whittome, all this is splitting hairs, yet she is operating in a world where precision matters.\nOf course, Whittome is not the first new MP to walk a tightrope between the formal demands of public life and staying true to his or her roots. (She has swapped numbers with the SNP MP Mhairi Black, who was only 20 when she was elected in 2015; they plan to compare notes over a drink.) But she is clearly anxious not to cut herself off from her community, which is why she promised to take home only £35,000 of her £79,468 salary and give the rest to local causes and strike funds. Her sacrifice may not have endeared her to Labour colleagues, who will be bracing themselves to justify taking their full pay. But Whittome says she did not mean to imply that politicians do not deserve the money; she just thinks that firefighters and teaching assistants deserve a rise, too – and she will take hers only when they get theirs. So is this purely a personal decision, or does she think other MPs should follow suit? “It’s a personal decision. I think it’s an important representative principle, because as Labour MPs we are workers’ representatives. I certainly don’t berate MPs for taking the full salary.”\nYet for all her determination to “rise with her class, not above it”, Whittome recognises that in some senses she has already changed. “As much as I was a working-class woman on 12 December, now I’m not,” she says. “I walk the corridors of power and I have huge responsibility to share that [power] with everyone else.”\nOn election night, Whittome tweeted about wanting to be “a new kind of MP”, inspired by radical women of colour. Those inspirations range from “the Squad” in the US – the hotshot progressive Democrats Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – to the late factory worker Jayaben Desai, who led the 1976 strike at the Grunwick film processing plant in north-west London. She feels particularly connected to Desai, who challenged lazy assumptions about female Indian workers: “People thought that she was a docile, subservient Asian woman and she was anything but.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘I walk the corridors of power and I have huge responsibility to share that power’ ... Whittome on ITV’s Peston with the Tory MP Tom Tugendhat and the Green MP Caroline Lucas. Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex/Shutterstock\nAdvertisement\nWhittome is under no illusions about what she may face in the current political climate. The day after the Brexit referendum, she was called an “effing black bitch” on the street in what is now her constituency. She does not consider the timing a coincidence. “I wasn’t the only person I know who suffered intensified abuse after Brexit,” she says. “I think Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson’s campaigns, which had very clear and overt racist undertones, legitimised the racism that already existed.” There is every chance that the abusive passerby is one of her constituents, while the man she sees as legitimising hate runs the country.\nThe lesson she takes from Corbyn’s crushing defeat last month is not that the party was too leftwing or too pro-remain, but that it didn’t make its case early enough, either for a second Brexit referendum or for policies such as free broadband. “The individual policies of the manifesto were popular, but there were just so many of them and we hadn’t built support,” Whittome says. She is passionate about tackling the climate crisis and would rather have seen the promise of 1m new green jobs take centre stage: “I think what should have been a climate election was taken over by a Brexit election.”\nWhittome nominated Clive Lewis to replace Corbyn as Labour leader – Lewis dropped out last week after failing to get enough nominations from Labour MPs and MEPs – and Dawn Butler for deputy. It worries her that BAME candidates such as Lewis, Butler and Rosena Allin-Khan had to plead for help getting on the ballot, while Lisa Nandy initially lagged behind the frontrunners; she remembers wanting to back Rushanara Ali for deputy in 2015 and not getting the chance because Ali could not get enough nominations. Why does she think this keeps happening? She says she has faith in her parliamentary colleagues, but adds: “I think we need to interrogate our unconscious biases … we’re lawmakers, and it’s our responsibility to interrogate our privilege and to use the immense power that we have to amplify the voices of people who don’t get heard.”\nShe is concerned, too, about calls for Labour to win back white, working-class voters by taking a tougher line on issues such as immigration. “That’s why I wanted Clive on the ballot. I don’t want to be back in a PLP [parliamentary Labour party] meeting in five years’ time, talking about losing and winning back our heartlands, but we are talking now about different heartlands: Brixton, Nottingham, Liverpool.” Her city seat is a traditional Labour stronghold, she points out, but one with many more black voters than the towns where Labour lost. “I want to hear from candidates and activists in those places about what needs to change. But I’m also clear that we can’t just follow the conversation with immigration – we need to lead it, too. We need to make arguments for immigrants that aren’t just about people’s economic value, because the continuation of that is: when they are no longer of any economic value, they’re not welcome here.”\nThe generational divide on the left between those comfortable with so-called identity politics and those occasionally confounded by it feels very clear talking to Whittome. Her politics is intersectional, deftly navigating the prickly places where race, class and other sources of discrimination collide; she expresses sympathy with the Duchess of Sussex’s battle for acceptance in Britain, but she adds that liberation is not only about women at the top: “Even if all the top business leaders were women of colour, that wouldn’t make one jot of difference while lower-paid women of colour were being paid less than £10 an hour for cleaning on zero-hours contracts.”\nAdvertisement\nYet this wariness of privilege in any form may not always sit easily with acquiring political power. When a cabbie asked recently if this was her dream job, she hesitated: “I thought: ‘Actually, I don’t think my generation dreams the way that the older generation really did.’ Our dreams are a lot more short-term: they’re things like moving out of the family home, getting a job – any job, really. These are the struggles that occupy a lot of our thinking. That and the fact that we won’t have a planet to live on if we don’t take drastic action. That’s my experience growing up in Nottingham – that we don’t live in a society where we can afford to dream.” Whittome can dream bigger now, but it may take her a while to get used to that.\n• This article was amended on 22 January 2020 to clarify that the sum of £35,000 which Whittome is planning to take is after tax. The basic annual salary for an MP before tax is £79,468.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

He applied for protection in New Zealand in 2013, claiming his and his family’s lives were at risk.\nThe committee heard evidence of overcrowding on the island of South Tarawa, where Teitiota lived, saying that the population there had increased from 1,641 in 1947 to 50,000 in 2010 due to sea level rising leading to other islands becoming uninhabitable, which had led to violence and social tensions.\nHe also spoke of the lack of fresh water and difficulty growing crops due to salinity of the water table causing serious health issues for his family. He said that as Kiribati was predicted to be uninhabitable in 10 to 15 years, his life was endangered by remaining there.\nThe New Zealand courts rejected Teitiota’s claim for protection. The UN human rights committee upheld New Zealand’s decision on the grounds that while “sea level rise is likely to render the republic of Kiribati uninhabitable … the timeframe of 10 to 15 years, as suggested by [Teitiota], could allow for intervening acts by the republic of Kiribati, with the assistance of the international community, to take affirmative measures to protect and, where necessary, relocate its population”.\nHowever experts say the committee’s ruling opens the way for other claims based on the threat to life posed by the climate crisis. The committee ruled that “the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights … thereby triggering the non-refoulement obligations of sending states”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“On a personal level for Ioane and his family it is bad news, because obviously it’s decided that his claim that his right to life was threatened in Kiribati wasn’t strong enough,” said Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher for Amnesty International. “But they said it wasn’t strong enough based on his personal circumstances and the evidence they put before the court and then they made some very strong statements clarifying the roles and responsibilities of states to say … there would be a trigger of international responsibility for other governments not to return people to places where their life is at risk because of climate-induced changes.”\nWhile the judgment is not formally binding on countries, it points to legal obligations that countries have under international law.\n“What’s really important here, and why it’s quite a landmark case, is that the committee recognised that without robust action on climate at some point in the future it could well be that governments will, under international human rights law, be prohibited from sending people to places where their life is at risk or where they would face inhuman or degrading treatment,” said Prof Jane McAdam, director of the Kaldor centre for international refugee law at the University of New South Wales.\n“Even though in this particular case there was no violation found, it effectively put governments on notice.\n“There have been cases brought in Australia and New Zealand since the mid-1990s about environmental harm and climate change and to date they’ve all been unsuccessful ... But now we’ve got a very clear, legal authoritative statement now that it’s almost like: watch this space.”\nSchuetze said there were roughly a dozen cases in the New Zealand court system similar to Teitiota’s, with people, mostly from Tuvalu and Kiribati, claiming the impacts of the climate crisis affected their right to life.\n“The Pacific Islands will be the canary in the coalmines for climate-induced migrants,” said Schuetze.\n“The message in this case is clear: Pacific Island states don’t need to be underwater before triggering those human rights obligations … I think we will see those cases start to emerge.”\nTwo of the 18 members of the committee issued dissenting opinions on the case, saying they did not agree with the conclusion that New Zealand was justified in removing Teitiota to Kiribati, with one writing that just because “deaths are not occurring with regularity on account of the conditions … it should not mean that the threshold had been reached”.\n“The fact that this [difficulty growing crops and accessing safe drinking water] is a reality for many others in the country, does not make it any more dignified for the persons living in such conditions. New Zealand’s action is more like forcing a drowning person back into a sinking vessel, with the ‘justification’ that after all there are other voyagers on board.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Here’s seven:\n1. Get cracking on the pre-election commitment to develop a 2050 long-term emissions reduction strategy by the end of 2020. This commitment was repeated at the Pacific Island Forum last August. All states and territories have at least aspirational 2050 net-zero emission targets. Leading Australian businesses and even the Business Council of Australia have adopted this goal. Consultation should start with this as a clear goal for the strategy from the outset and would advisedly be ready for this September’s Pacific Island Forum. The hosts of the 2020 forum, Vanuatu, have made clear scrutiny there will be just as tough as it was at last year’s event. This strategy, and a 2050 target of net-zero emissions, should drive other policy evolutions.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n2. Use the promised 2020 review of the government’s safeguard mechanism to change its role towards driving emissions reductions, rather than just limiting emission increases. The safeguard mechanism provides some compliance responsibilities for more than 250 emitters. In 2019 the Carbon Market Institute released a discussion paper that details options for how this could evolve, including into a baseline and credit scheme. This could incentivise business investments in cleaner technologies and carbon farming which could lead to business, not the taxpayer, becoming the primary investor in net emissions reductions. This should be aligned with national climate targets, current or improved (see below).\n3. Improve the operation of the government’s emissions reduction fund. The government, with the assistance of an expert panel led by Grant King, is reviewing the operation of the taxpayer-funded ERF and is topping it up with almost $2bn over 15 years under its climate solutions package. The panel is also reviewing ways to improve the ERF’s reach. This includes investigating how to leverage state-based schemes such as Queensland’s innovative land restoration fund, and finding ways to engage property and other sectors not yet involved with the ERF. Responding to the recommendations soon to be made by the panel could boost outcomes for energy efficiency, as well as the industrial, agricultural and other sectors. An evolved safeguard mechanism could free up a large part of the $2bn for other clean technology development, including boosting Arena funding and investment in environmental repair initiatives.\nIf the bushfires won't force climate policy change, we need to circumvent Scott Morrison\nLenore Taylor\nRead more\n4. Streamline carbon project applications and audit processes without undermining the integrity of Australia’s internationally respected land-based carbon farming initiative. The government has shown its intent in continuing to support carbon farming projects, which to date have been the major beneficiaries of the ERF. Thankfully, the bulk of the ERF projects appear not to have been damaged in the fires. However, post-bushfire reviews should boost efforts under way to encourage investment in carbon farming initiatives already restoring landscapes, improving resilience and providing additional revenue streams and jobs to farmers, Indigenous peoples and regional communities. We are consulting with governments, industry and other stakeholders on other implications of increasing bushfires.\n5. Use the technology investment roadmap discussed at the November 2019 Coag Energy Council to focus on hydrogen, the imminent electric vehicle strategy and renewed focus on carbon capture and storage. This can be integrated with a long-term strategy and enable the government to develop sectoral decarbonisation pathways to address barriers and unlock the abundant economic opportunities Australia has in clean energy, clean technology, as well as carbon farming and storage.\n6. Join the more than 100 countries strengthening their first nationally determined contribution under the Paris agreement. Australia is one of many countries with an inadequate first target, the combined efforts of which, has the world heading for over three degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels. Those nations strengthening their NDCs – most with smaller carbon footprints than Australia – recognise this dangerous trajectory. Greater ambition should include curtailing the use of Kyoto carryover credits that no other country is proposing to use.\n7. With a clear long-term strategy and a strengthened initial NDC, Australia can join more coalitions seeking to boost climate ambition and action. Australia has been a leader in partnerships such as the International Partnership for Blue Carbon and, in Madrid, joined the Leadership Group for Industry Transition. Australia could also join the Climate Ambition Alliance which now includes 73 nations, 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors working towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe government can draw on private-sector momentum in evolving its policies. Our farming sector, in particular Meat and Livestock Australia, has goals of carbon neutrality by 2030. The Carbon Market Institute’s 2019 Australian Climate Policy Survey showed that 83% of business respondents support a 2050 target of net-zero emissions and more backing policy improvements.\nWith further reviews of biodiversity laws and the need to resolve renewable energy policies after the 2020 renewable energy target legislation, the government has numerous opportunities to evolve policies this year. It can integrate this into the vast task of community and environmental repair at hand once the bushfire horror ends.\nJohn Connor is the CEO of the Carbon Market Institute\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Adapting to climate change isn’t enough","paragraph":"Not long ago, somebody said to me, “It would take a huge disaster for this government to acknowledge that there is such a thing as climate change.” Tragic, but perhaps true.\nWhile we now seem to have grudging government acknowledgment that climate change is the predominant driver of the current bushfire disaster (notwithstanding it previously being portrayed as “not a factor”, “one of many factors” or a delusion of inner-city latte-sipping greenies, etc), the acknowledgment has yet to be matched by action on the root cause.\nMake no mistake: this disaster is a weather-driven event, not a fuel-driven one, underpinned by years of drying and warming. Climate change is the driver of increasing extreme weather.\nBehind the smokescreen, the Coalition's stance on climate change hasn't changed at all\nGreg Jericho\nRead more\nI recently returned home from another three days of fighting fires as an Rural Fire Service volunteer. I’ve lost count of the deployments: Grafton, Wollombi, Spencer, Howes Valley, Bargo, Blackheath, Batemans Bay, Wombeyan Caves, and others. Like countless other men and women on the front line I have faced off against 30-metre walls of flame, seen many homes burned to the ground, tried to console inconsolable residents, been forced to run for safety and seen native animals bounding out of the burning bush to collapse and die. Devastating.\nParticularly devastating because together with 22 former fire and emergency service chiefs from every state and territory I had tried from April 2019 to warn the prime minister about what veteran firefighters, climate scientists and meteorologists all identified as a looming bushfire disaster. We were ignored and trivialised: the government inferred that we were criticising the efforts of current fire chiefs and told us via the media that we could be assured that the “new breed” of chiefs “had it under control”. Of course, this missed the point entirely. We were trying to say things that the existing hard-pressed, hard-working chiefs could not. Our suggestions about better using the military and freeing up processes to allow them to be used in non-firefighting support roles, our request for approval of additional funding for large firefighting aircraft, and better national coordination (following the hollowing out of Emergency Management Australia, which has now been absorbed into the huge Home Affairs bureaucracy) were ridiculed. Until, of course, the disaster worsened, and the media and public called for action. Then the government “took the initiative”.\nContinuing to burn coal, oil and gas is sending us down a pathway to an even hotter, drier Australia where conditions will get worse\nThere has been an appalling failure in national leadership from Canberra. Failure to recognise and prepare for what was coming. Failure to accept briefings from experts. Failure to understand and accept the government’s national support role to the states and territories. Failure to provide funding certainty for critical equipment requested by fire agencies in a detailed business case but stalled in Canberra since May 2018.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the government is failing again by now suggesting that our primary focus should be on adapting to climate change rather than upping our efforts to tackle the root cause: the burning of fossil fuels. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas is sending us down a pathway to an even hotter, drier Australia where conditions will get worse and worse.\nWidespread rain in New South Wales is helping, but months of hot weather could still lie ahead. NSW has lost approximately 10 times more homes than in its previous worst fire year, 1994, and burned five times more country than it did in that year. We are yet to enter the worst fire danger period for Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, yet they have already been burning. Things could still worsen.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nGreg Mullins: ‘I wish that as Australians we could again act with moral authority on this global issue, as we did on issues like nuclear disarmament, apartheid and gun control.’ Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\nThe established trend of dryness, hotter temperatures, extreme weather and lengthening fire seasons is unfortunately our “new normal”. Scott Morrison didn’t give us an opportunity to explain to him Tasmania’s increasing frequency of fire seasons, the two-month lengthening of NSW fire seasons, how Queensland is now a “bushfire state”, the now common dry lightning storms (no, not all fires are caused by arsonists), the critically dry fuels after a 20-year drying trend restricting hazard reduction (no, not caused by greenies stopping “backburning”), fires creating their own weather (pyro-convective activity), and how these factors and others, driven by climate change, have made Australia more dangerous.\nExplainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?\nRead more\nAustralia MUST take urgent action on emissions and stop the lies about the current ineffective response to our climate emergency. I fear for future generations and I wish that as Australians we could again act with moral authority on this global issue, as we did on issues such as nuclear disarmament, apartheid and gun control.

Morrison said although the government will review the possibility of reaching zero emissions by 2050, in line with its Pacific Island Forum commitment, it would not adopt the target if it “didn’t know the cost”.\nThe treasurer Josh Frydenberg backed Morrison’s position, by saying Kean was “wrong” to say cabinet ministers want the government to do more on climate change.\nAfter an unprecedented summer season of bushfires which Kean and even Morrison himself have conceded is caused in part by climate change, the federal government is under pressure to do more to fight global heating.\nAt the 2019 election a record number of voters nominated climate change or the environment as their top concern.\nCoalition MPs split over Scott Morrison's apparent shift on climate policy\nRead more\nMorrison has suggested the Coalition could go “even further” than the target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, which was met with a chorus of approval from moderate Liberals but sparked warnings of negative consequences for Morrison by conservative Liberals and Nationals MPs.\nOn Monday, Morrison denied that federal Liberals were pushing to increase emissions reduction ambition, telling broadcaster Sabra Lane that “what is being suggested by your question is that there are others [who want a stronger policy] – that just isn’t the case”.\nAdvertisement\n“The government is completely united on focusing on the challenge of the response to the current bushfire crisis and meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets and taking our climate policies forward over the next term of government.”\nMorrison said the government was still aiming for a 26% emission reduction, and noted that while the government had a target, “I can’t say that for everyone else” – a reference to the fact Labor will announce its target closer to the next election.\nMorrison ruled out a carbon tax, increasing electricity prices and “[wiping] out resource industries”.\nMorrison told 3AW Radio he had “no idea” if Labor will aim for zero carbon emissions by 2050 but acknowledged that “we undertook to look at that through the Pacific Islands Forum commitment I gave last year”.\n“But we need to understand what that means – I mean, people can say that, but what does that mean for jobs?

Perhaps if we started talking about the biosphere of which we are all a part as “the life support system” and the choices politicians make as being between the protection of life and the destruction of life, then the consequences of these choices might be easier for us to grasp.\nIsabella Stone\nSheffield\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Rising sea levels and more frequent storms brought on by the global climate emergency have accelerated the erosion.\nCouncillors will this week urge ministers to treat coastal erosion as a natural catastrophe like flooding, saying that there is a lack of national guidance and funding to help tackle the issue.\nJane Evison, a councillor on East Riding council, said families whose homes were at imminent risk of sliding into the sea were liable to pay the full cost of demolishing their property and for their relocation.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) provides up to £6,000 in retrospective funding towards the cost of demolishing each property, but Evison said the total bill was at least double that.\n“The’ve lost their home and the legal responsibility is on them – they don’t have that sort of money,” she said. “At the moment the only funding we have available to us is from Defra [but] it doesn’t cover the cost at all, and then the council is making up the remainder of what it costs.”\nEvison said ministers should treat coastal erosion like flooding, where significantly larger pots of funding are made available to local authorities, homeowners and businesses to cover the bill for damage. She said: “We know sea levels are rising. It’s going to accelerate. It’s an act of nature we have no control over. We think it isn’t a special case – it’s the same as flooding – so we should be able to bid for genuine costs to help keep people safe.”\nA council report, due to be discussed on Wednesday, found that some parts of the picturesque Yorkshire coastline were disappearing at more than double the average speed. On one two-mile stretch south of Withernsea, near Hull, 10 metres were lost in nine months last year, compared with a yearly average of four metres.\nThe report states: “This erosion rate is expected to increase in future due to sea level rise and more frequent storm events linked to climate change, which will put even greater pressure on both the coast and council resources.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAbandoned holiday chalets in Withernsea. Parts of the 52-mile Eeast Yorkshire coast are disappearing much faster than forecast. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n“Despite this, there remains a lack of national policy guidance and funding mechanisms for adaptive management in locations where defences cannot be constructed or maintained.”\nProf Mike Elliott, who co-authored an academic report on coastal erosion, said the government was wary of “opening the floodgates” to potentially thousands of compensation claims for people living on the eroding east coast, which stretches from Bridlington to the white cliffs of Dover.\nA Defra spokesman said it was investing £1.2bn in coastal defences to protect 170,000 properties by 2021 and that it was working with local authorities on a £23m five-year scheme to monitor the erosion.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual talkfest in the snow, is “committed to improving the state of the world” but in key respects things look worse today than they did at the start of the 70s.\nNot in every way, obviously. The percentage of the world’s population living in abject poverty has come down sharply, largely because of rapid growth in China and India. The gap between rich and poor within countries has increased over the past five decades but inequality is not the same as destitution. Living standards have risen, whether measured by incomes per head, life expectancy or technical progress.\nWarm words in the alps … Davos prepares for 50th economics shindig\nRead more\nThere were no smartphones in 1971 and nor was there an inkling that they would be manufactured in the economic superpower that China has become. Under Mao, China was essentially a peasant economy and the reforms that led to industrialisation and the migration from the country to the cities were still some way off. Nobody had the slightest interest in China’s growth rate or its trade policy. A small group of developed countries – led by the US – accounted for the lion’s share of global GDP and called all the shots. That is no longer the case.\nBy the early 70s, the long period of post second world war growth was coming to an end. The Bretton Woods currency system, held together by the link between the US dollar and gold, would collapse in 1971 as a result of the inflationary strains on the American economy caused by the cost of the Vietnam war and higher domestic spending.\nThe mood music does not seem to have changed all that much. The 2020 Davos takes place amid concern that a crisis is looming. It is more than a decade since the end of the financial crisis of 2007-09 but the recovery has been tepid. Wage growth, investment growth and productivity growth have all been poor. Financial markets look dangerously overvalued.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDonald Trump is due to visit the World Economic Forum in Davos on 21 January. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\nSo why is the current state of affairs more troubling than it was in 1971? Well, for a start there seemed a simple – if harsh – way out of the economic problems associated with the end of Bretton Woods. Inflation, according to economists such as Milton Friedman, was caused by profligate governments printing too much money to pay for excessive wage settlements and public spending pledges. The answer was to reduce budget deficits, to rein in the power of organised labour and to give control of interest rates to independent central banks.\nAdvertisement\nThis was broadly the system in place from the mid-1970s to the moment when everything went pear-shaped in 2008. At that point, there was something of a crash rethink. Interest rates were slashed, central banks pumped money into their economies, budget deficits were allowed to balloon. Yet the strong and sustained recovery that was expected has not happened. The main impact of the extraordinary policy stimulus has been seen in asset prices rather than in the real economy. In the event of another crisis, central banks look to be short of conventional weapons.\nTentatively, there are signs that fiscal policy – regulating the economy through tax and public spending – is making a comeback. In Britain, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, says interest rates are going to stay low for years to come, making it possible to borrow cheaply for long-term infrastructure projects.\nClearly, the money could be put to good use. The big, inescapable difference between the 1971 Davos and the one this week is the threat posed by the climate emergency. A flick through Fritz Schumacher’s seminal 1973 green text – Small is Beautiful – finds no mention of global heating. It simply was not a political issue back then.\nNow, of course, it is. Each year the WEF asks a sample of experts and policymakers to list the most likely risks the world will face over the next decade. Unsurprisingly, against a backdrop of droughts, hurricanes, bushfires, melting glaciers and a steady heating of the planet, for the first time the top five threats are all environmental.\nSign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nKlaus Schwab, the founder of Davos and the WEF’s executive chairman, has written to all those attending this year’s event urging them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. An indication of how successful that appeal will be should come on Tuesday when Donald Trump drops by.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nWhat Trump should say – but won’t – is as follows: the US recognises the existential threat posed by global heating. It accepts that multilateral cooperation is needed if the problem is to be tackled before it it is too late. As a businessman, he is aware that no company could hope to survive if it depleted its own capital in the way that humans are consuming natural resources.\nAdvertisement\nTo that end, the White House is working on an ambitious plan for the climate change summit due to be held in Glasgow at the end of this year. As the world’s biggest economy, the US will commit to stringent emissions targets, commit to renewable energy and bankroll a modern equivalent of the postwar Marshall Plan to help poor countries make the transition to a low-carbon future. Why? Because whereas the threat in 1948 was the spread of communism, now it is the much greater danger that capitalism will eat itself.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

They are awfully vague’","paragraph":"T\nhere have been many proposed solutions to the climate crisis – from outright bans on fossil fuels to planting 2 billion trees – but Jonathan Safran Foer’s antidote to global devastation strikes me as the neatest and most achievable. It could sound like something written by a prophet in stone: Eat No Meat Before Sundown. But Safran Foer, in his brilliant book, We Are the Weather, insists on couching it in far more conversational terms: we need to make a “collective act to eat differently”, he says, and one straightforward way is to aim to eat no animal products before dinner.\nThis idea for a roughly two-third shift in animal consumption comes armed with unarguable statistics about its positive effect in reversing climate trends, including the killer pay-off: “If cows were a country they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.”\nAdvertisement\nI meet Safran Foer in London in the autumn, while Extinction Rebellion are glueing themselves to corporate buildings. He has chosen to eat at Nopi, Ottolenghi’s brasserie outpost off London’s Regent Street, not least because in Safran Foer’s decade of campaigning against factory farming (his 2009 book Eating Animals was the starting point) the chef has become a good friend and ally.\nWe order sharing plates including cauliflower and green bean fritters, hispi cabbage and tofu mayonnaise, chickpeas with sumac feta and – ignoring any potential for caricature – talk first about the protests and their effect. There has, Safran Foer says, been nothing remotely like them in the US, but he is not convinced they are effective. “I saw a protester asked on the news, ‘What is the point?’” he says. “The reply was the obvious one: ‘We wouldn’t be talking about it now, if this were not happening.’ But is that exactly a point? You can imagine ways in which it could be a bad thing if it becomes too divisive, or is seen as just a liberal concern.”\nSign up for Bookmarks: discover new books in our weekly email\nRead more\nOne theme of his book is that human beings cannot hold potential apocalypse in their minds for very long: “We are good at things like calculating the path of a hurricane,” he writes, “and bad at things like deciding to get out of its way.” He uses at one point the analogy of his grandmother’s family in 1930s Poland to examine human reaction to the psychology of existential threat. His grandmother heard what was happening in Germany and – partly through luck and circumstance – decided to emigrate. All her relations heard the same news and were paralysed by it, or had other concerns. He fears that is the effect of a lot of well-intentioned hand-wringing about the planet, the virtue-signalling threats of doom. The scale overwhelms us, and we do nothing.\n“I don’t understand why the Extinction movement isn’t concretising. Why it isn’t issuing specific ideas,” he says. “They are awfully vague and unrealistic. Why not say: ‘Here’s a thing we can all do to help this month?’ And do that every month. I feel then that an awful lot of people would start to give it a shot.”\nHis informed suggestion about daytime veganism is a case in point. But even then, and in his book, he cautions against being too shrill. One of the most persuasive adopters of his plan in the US has been the chef Samin Nosrat, bestselling author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. “The way Samin talks about it is climate leadership, for me,” Safran Foer says. “She doesn’t ask anyone else to do it. She says: ‘I might not be consistent with it, it is going to be a big change. But knowing what I know, this is what I feel I should do.’ When people lecture me on their own ethical accomplishment, I find that extremely annoying and certainly not inspiring. But if somebody says, ‘I want to try this, I fear I might fail,’ people start to think, ‘Well, you know, I could try that too.’”\nThe goal is not to perfect a virtuous identity for yourself. The goal is to reduce the carbon in the atmosphere\nSafran Foer is upfront about his own lapses in the book. He confesses even to one or two fast-food burger moments when tired or emotional or lazy. That seemed to me quite a brave thing to do, but also a persuasive one.\n“It felt like an embarrassing thing to write,” he says. “But I have definitely had meat. And I have often wanted it. These days I find cooking vegetarian quite easy. But veganism is much more difficult. I mean I wrote the book, so I had to do it. But it was still like, ‘Oh shit, this is difficult.’”\nHe thinks that above all we need to get away from thinking in binary terms. “If someone says to me, you know, I couldn’t give up chicken, or cheese, or burrata, that’s fine, just eat much less of it, or only eat it for dinner. The goal is not to perfect a virtuous identity for yourself. The goal is to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.”\nSafran Foer first found a global audience as a wunderkind novelist. His book Everything is Illuminated, a fictional personal journey into Holocaust history, earned him an eye-watering publisher’s advance and universal critical acclaim. It came out when he was only 25. He followed it with another chunky bestseller, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which offered a child’s eye view on the 9/11 attacks, and became a film starring Tom Hanks. In his two polemical books, he uses a pared-down version of that hyper-intelligent novelist’s voice, but retains a genius for a compelling story and a telling detail.\nHe understands that the best of the latter are often the most simple. One thing that struck him when he started to share a platform with distinguished climate scientists was that they were all, to a woman and man, vegetarian. “They just took that as read,” he says, “in the same way they would never drive an SUV. The funny thing was that it was too obvious to them almost to mention.”\nAnother telling revelation, he says, struck him when Eating Animals came out. He imagined it would likely be loved by animal rights protesters and hated by farmers. In fact, he had the opposite experience. “Farmers I spoke to welcomed the book. They despise factory farming more than anyone. The whole model of industrial agriculture obviously seeks to remove farmers from the process. Sustainable farming offers them a future.” The protesters, meanwhile, found plenty to protest about in Safran Foer’s human and realistic tone, because that is what they do.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThey shared Roasted aubergine, tamarind yogurt, preserved lemon, cashews, £10.80; chickpeas, butternut squash, sundried tomatoes, mint, sumac feta, £9.80; cauliflower and green bean fritters, amba, coconut tahini, £12; chargrilled hispi cabbage, tofu mayonnaise, pickled cucumber, sea purslane, £11.50; Valdeón cheesecake, pickled beetroot, thyme honey, almonds, £12.80. NOPI 21-22 Warwick St, London W1B 5NE. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer\nAdvertisement\nWe dig into our sharing plates, Safran Foer doing his best to avoid the rule-breaking components of our order, yogurt and feta. “This is part of my difficulty right here,” he says, of a slightly awkward interaction with the waiter when he suggested he would rather not have dairy. “I still don’t quite know how to have the conversation about these things. I know how well they source things here. And I don’t like that feeling of sounding judgmental. There is nothing I like less than going to dinner at a friend’s house having forgotten to tell them.”\nWhat will he do?\n“It depends. If they have gone to a lot of effort sometimes I might not say, just because in the scheme of things one dinner obviously doesn’t matter.”\nIn all of this, he suggests, we put too much emphasis on motivation and not enough on action. An honest commitment to try to change habits is always far more effective than hard-and-fast denial, but deciding what is possible is the first step. He tells a story of a couple he met at a reading he gave; when he came to sign their copy of his book he saw that the title page was covered in writing. “They told me that they were about to get married, and decided to have a plan for the future. The plan involved trying to eat vegetarian except at dinner. Vegan two days a week. Have no more than two kids. And to drive no more than 1,500 miles a year. That struck me as a good way of looking at it.” Safran Foer went home that evening and wrote his own plan. It involved among other things a commitment not to fly for vacations as well as one to try to stick to his diet. “Everyone might think about a plan,” he says. And what better moment to adopt one than new year 2020?\nWe Are the Weather is out now (Hamish Hamilton, £16.99).

Literally, given the levels of smoke still around.\nYou don’t get a cookie for saying you think climate change is real.\nI’m sorry, you don’t. All you get is the capacity to say you have reached 1990 levels of comprehension – as that was when the first IPCC report was issued. You don’t get a prize for spending 30 years doing all you can to halt, undermine and dismantle action to reduce emissions, only to now say: “Hey, climate change is real.”\nConsider that the Sydney Morning Herald this week ran a front page story headlined “Minister slams climate debate”, with the lead that “Australia’s bushfire crisis has prompted a blunt warning from Science Minister Karen Andrews to those she says are wasting time arguing about whether climate change is real”.\nThe government has been forced to talk about climate change, so it’s taking a subtle – and sinister – approach\nGreg Jericho\nRead more\nOh good, that’s all sorted then.\nBut when you read on, you see nothing in her statement suggest one iota of a shift in the government’s position on emissions. She told the Herald: “My starting position in the discussion tomorrow will be that the climate has changed and it continues to change. We need to focus on the steps to adapt and mitigate the impact of those changes.”\nThe important point is she desires to mitigate the impact of the change, not to mitigate the actual change.\nRight now the government is indulging in the equivalent of responding to polio by promising to invest in more iron lungs. And bizarrely, it is getting credit for it.\nAdaptation is not mitigation.\nThe need for action on climate change is the need to reduce emissions\nWhat is being said now is no different to what was said by Tony Abbott back when he was prime minister. In 2015, Abbott told parliament: “As far as the government is concerned, climate change is real.

This week the NT News was getting praise for its front page, in which it stated: “What Australian needs now is real, affordable solutions – not armies of keyboard warriors.”\nBut aside from the pretty random sideswipe at keyboard warriors, the statement is the perfect representation of meaningless dribble designed to sound like a bold stance.\nYou know what is a real and affordable solution? Putting a price on carbon. And yet in the NT News editorial, the word emissions was not even mentioned, and I am prepared to bet my superannuation fund they would not suggest a price on carbon was an affordable solution.\nSimilarly the Daily Telegraph’s editorial on Thursday on “Moving climate debate forward” praised the government’s policy and demanded the ALP come clean with how much theirs would cost.\nGive me strength.\nIt seems that moving forward is reenacting the exact same coverage that occurred during the last election.\nYou can’t say you agree with the science on climate change and then completely disregard the science that calls for the need to reduce emission by 45% from 2010 levels as soon as possible and to get to zero net emissions by at least 2050.\nSaying you agree with the science of climate change but that you believe the government’s current plan is adequate is like saying you agree with vaccination, but you chose to only get one of your three kids immunised because, heck, that is more affordable.\nThe Coalition isn't being honest about the climate crisis.

Our first day of live coverage, incredibly, was on 10 September, months before the normal onset of the bushfire season, when fires raced through parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. Since early November we have covered the fires live on 32 days, including continuously from 16 December to Christmas Eve, and again from 30 December to 11 January, often for more than 12 hours a day.\nBut of course an event of this size and drama cannot be covered solely from the office. The logistical challenges of putting reporters and photographers into fire zones hundreds of kilometres from their Sydney or Melbourne bases have been huge. The safety of our journalists has always been our priority, but inevitably in a situation where the demands on them are extreme and communications often impaired, there have been anxious moments. We have been rewarded by extraordinary dispatches, telling the stories of places whose names have sadly become synonymous with disaster: Balmoral, Cobargo, East Gippsland. In other towns, such as Mallacoota and Malua Bay, we have been able to reconstruct the terrifying events there through the accounts of residents both in print and audio.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe crisis came at what is usually the quietest news time of the year, when many staff are on leave. Many gave up their summer breaks to work long hours on our coverage. Some were themselves caught up in the fires while on holiday, able to report on a harrowing experience only when communications were restored.\nReporting events on this scale has been challenging enough, but putting them in the context both of Australian domestic politics and the wider question of climate change has put even greater demands on our reporters and opinion writers. From the start we have been at pains to keep the climate crisis at the forefront of our coverage, by explaining the science and holding the government to account for its response.\nCalla Walhquist, reporter\nAdvertisement\nThe photographer Chris Hopkins and I drove from Melbourne to Bairnsdale, Victoria on Monday 30 December, the day after emergency services took the unprecedented step of advising everybody in the far-east wedge of the state to get out.\nUnder a bridge on the eastern side of Bairnsdale, next to a sign that said “no camping”, we found evacuees such as 77-year-old Marilyn Withers, whose face was red from the 43C heat.\nThat night the temporary campground under the bridge swelled to the hundreds, including many who had fled with just the clothes on their backs and who were now sleeping in their cars. The discount department store sold out of tents that night, we were told. Many people had not intended to flee, but changed their minds when they saw the size and speed of the smoke column.\nIt looked like a moving volcano. We watched from a pie-and-sandwich shop on the edge of town alongside Alan and Jenny Blair, who had made a last-minute decision to leave their six-hectare property at Wy Yung. While we spoke the wind was roaring in from the north-west, pushing the fire towards Wy Yung and Bairnsdale. At 5pm, the wind changed, sparing the Blairs’ home but devastating the villages of Clifton Creek, Sarsfield, and Bruthen, taking 43 houses and a school.\nThe next morning at the official evacuation centre it was easy to spot those whose houses had been lost. They walked around white-faced, desperate to talk to someone but wary of the notebook. I made friends with the animals: 250 horses held safe in the saleyards, countless dogs, five chickens laying eggs in the back of a Landrover. Shellshocked humans who did not want to talk about how they were doing told me about how their pets were faring, and then their kids, and then finally themselves.\nEveryone who stayed to defend their property told us they would never do that again.\nI grew up in the shadow of bushfires, on the other side of the Victorian alps. When a woman told me the church where her family was buried had burned down, I told her my family’s church had burned too, in another bushfire. It feels inevitable now that if you live in Australia some part of your life will burn down. It’s just a matter of when.\nHelen Davidson, reporter\nMy first fire callout this season was to the well-heeled Sydney suburb of Turramurra in November, where no property was lost, houses were doused in the delightfully coloured pink fire retardant and some departing firefighters handed us ice creams on their way out.\nMy most recent was to the area around Nowra, south of Sydney, and the NSW southern highlands in January, where houses were lost and fires created their own lightning storms.\nAdvertisement\nIn between, I went to the Mount Gospers fire twice and the Green Wattle Creek fire as it hit Balmoral again and again over consecutive days.\nReporting on the fires requires a lot of driving, instinct and guesswork. There is often more information in the newsroom than on the ground, and we relied a lot on firefighters, the fire and traffic apps and radio broadcasts. I also received text updates on wind and weather changes from my dad, who can read charts better than I can.\nWe would find crews, conduct interviews, take photos and get advice about where we could see firefighting efforts without getting in the way or getting too reckless. Then we’d park the car for half an hour, file to Guardian Australia’s live blog or the news desk, and do it all again somewhere else.\nIn Kurrajong Heights, photographer Jessica Hromas and I met a strike team waiting for a fire to come up from the gorge and into the suburbs. A firefighter told us where to park our car – facing out and with doors unlocked – and said he’d give us a radio so he could tell us when to escape.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe fire front approaches Kurrajong Heights Bowling Club on 21 December. Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian\nAgain and again I saw the short-lived relief in people’s faces as a wind change saved their home, before they realised it meant someone else would likely lose theirs.\nFrom a personal point of view, it has been heartbreaking. The scale of the disaster, the fear and anger and sense of powerlessness on the ground is palpable, and it’s the moments that are hard to write about in the usual news style that I will remember the longest:\nThe sound of thunder in Nowra rolling overhead from dirty brown clouds, knowing it was one of three storms generated by a nearby fire.\nThe feeling of guilt having firefighters check on our welfare and make sure we weren’t hungry.\nThe steely bravery on the face of a 12-year-old kid who wasn’t evacuated before the roads closed and was now helping their mum put out spot fires in the backyard.\nThe overwhelming desire to hug interview subjects, either because they’d just gone through something horrific or they’d just done something extraordinarily selfless, and because this isn’t just a news story, this is home.\nGraham Readfearn, environment reporter\nAdvertisement\nThere has been a lot of anger and politics swirling around Australia’s bushfires, as well as a lot of facts – some relevant, some not, and some fake.\nAs an environment reporter, one of my main roles during the bushfire crisis has been to get into that swirling mess and come out with something that gives people a clear picture of what’s going on.\nSo while some of my colleagues have been delivering blistering and heart-wrenching narratives from the fire grounds, I’ve been knee deep in academic papers about bushfires, and conversations about the Forest Fire Danger Index and the Indian Ocean dipole.\nI have been talking to ecologists to work out what the environmental impact of these fires will be – the answer is unfolding, but the experts say they’ll be amazed if we don’t see species becoming extinct.\nWe’d had warnings this bushfire season was going to be bad – rainfall had been at record low levels in many areas, and temperatures at record highs.\nAs the fires took hold in NSW and continued in Queensland, a blame game emerged. These fires had little to do with the climate crisis, some were saying, but were down to “greenies” and their “policies” to stop hazard-reduction burning in forests and national parks.\nAustralia has plenty of academic expertise on bushfires because it’s part of our lived experience. One of the first people I spoke to, Prof Ross Bradstock, gave an almighty sigh when I called him up to ask if this really was all the fault of the Greens.\nThis was “conspiracy stuff”, he said, an accusation that almost always came up after major bushfires. I later took a further look at hazard-reduction techniques and their limitations.\nI tried never to leave the climate question unanswered.\nI’ve spoken to I don’t know how many experts in their field over the last few months. I’ve disturbed conservationists and scientists on their holidays. One ecologist on Kangaroo Island was telling me what was going on while she and her children evacuated her house from the threat of a fire. The climate crisis comes up in every conversation.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It’s supposed to stand for another 500 years'","paragraph":"T\nhe fable of the giant sequoia tree is an enduring tale of America’s fortitude. Standing quietly on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the Californian giants can survive almost anything – fire, disease, insect attack, cold years, hot years, drought – so the story goes.\nThe largest living organisms on the planet can grow over 90 metres (300ft) tall. When they do die after 3,000 years or so, the oldest trees, known as monarchs, usually succumb to their own size and collapse. Their giant trunks will rest on the forest floor for another millennium.\nBeetles and fire kill dozens of 'indestructible' giant sequoia trees\nRead more\nBut the miraculous story of the near-indestructible giant trees that millions of Americans tell their children is no longer true.\nThe giant trees are a huge tourist draw. They can grow to over 90 metres tall, and stand for 3,000 years or so, the oldest and largest often felled by their own weight\nFor the first time in recorded history, tiny bark beetles emboldened by the climate crisis have started to kill giant sequoia trees, according to a joint National Park Service and US Geological Survey study set to be published later this year. Twenty-eight have gone since 2014. The combination of drought stress and fire damage appears to make the largest sequoias susceptible to deadly insect infestations that they would usually withstand.\nOne of the 28 is the optimistically named Lazarus, which stands in the Giant Forest in Sequoia national park, surrounded by other sequoias and a handful of cedars and pines that died in California’s great drought.\nLazarus, a dead monarch sequoia, stands surrounded by a handful of cedars and pines that died in California’s great drought\nWhen Dr Christy Brigham, who is responsible for the welfare of the ecosystems in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, saw Lazarus for the first time, all she could do was weep.\n“This is a tree that has lived through 2,000 years of fires, other droughts, wet years, dry years, hot years, cold years. It’s been here longer than Europeans have been in this country and it’s dead. And it shouldn’t be dead. This is not how giant sequoias die. It’s suppose to stand there for another 500 years with all its needles on it, this quirky, persistent, impressive, amazing thing, and then fall over. It’s not supposed to have all of its needles fall off from the top to the bottom and then stand there like that. That’s not how giant sequoias die,” she says, standing next to the skeletal Lazarus as the occasional tourist wanders past.\nDr Christy Brigham, who is responsible for the welfare of the ecosystems in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks\nEven as tens of millions of trees died around them in California’s historic drought, reassuringly the vast majority of giant sequoias appeared to stand strong, as they had always done. But in 2017, Dr Nathan Stephenson, a forest ecologist with the US Geological Survey, noticed a dead branch showing signs of beetle damage had fallen from a giant sequoia. Trees had died standing since 2014, but the fallen branches were the first indication of what might be going on. Other researchers took samples of live branches from the top of sequoias that were dying from the top down and incubated the branches for further research.\n“Hundreds of beetles came out of these pieces of branch. We went back the next spring and that part of the tree that had been sampled was now dead,” he recalls, detailing how the giant sequoia faded to its death from the top down. Stephenson emphasises that there is still further research to do on how bark beetles are killing giant sequoias but he is clear on one thing.\n“I think beyond reasonable doubt in the limited set of circumstances, which was the most severe drought on record and all the trees had had a recent fire at their base, you can weaken giant sequoias to the point that bark beetles can kill them.”\nDr Christy Brigham locates a group of dead sequoias and observes a fallen monarch. Pieces of bark patterned with bark beetle galleries indicate that something is wrong with a nearby sequoia\nThe post-mortem site of another monarch that died in this way stretches along the forest floor a short walk from Lazarus. The tree, unnamed, had been felled and cut into chunks to protect tourists passing on a nearby road. At what would have been the top, the bark exhibits the telltale cause of death: the elegant spirals and grooves of beetle galleries, formed where the insects are thought to have entered and slowly killed the weakened tree.\nIt is hard not to reflect on what the dead giant sequoia had endured and what awaits other trees in California’s groves. As CO2 levels continue to rise, wildfires grow in intensity and the climate crisis alters ecosystems in just a few years, what does the future hold for these giants of the forest?\n“Predicting the future is a fool’s errand. But I would expect a ramping up of what we’ve already seen,” Stephenson says. Stephenson does not expect the widespread mortality events seen in other trees on the west coast but as everyone the Guardian speaks to emphasises, nobody has seen this before.\nThe Giant Forest, situated within Sequoia national park, is a mix of white fir, incense cedar, sugar pine, ponderosa pine and giant sequoia trees. The grey trees here are dead; in areas of the national park tree mortality of some species is 70%\nMore than a century of fire suppression has hurt the health of these forests. Since the late 1880s, landscapes that are meant to burn regularly in California have not, causing a huge buildup of wood and dead trees on the forest floor. When the inevitable fires do come, they are increasingly not slow, smouldering blazes that clear the forest floor and invite new life to thrive. The fires are intense, more regular than they should be, incinerating monarch sequoias that should be able to survive.\nThose trees that have succumbed from the top down in the drought – flagging first, then turning deathly autumnal orange – now stand grey on the mountainside in their millions, including many at famous views in Yosemite.\nView over the Yosemite Valley as one of the first winter storms approaches, bringing much-needed moisture\nYosemite national park, famous for its climbing, landscapes and wildlife, is struggling to deal with the wave of dead trees. They line roads, threatening to topple on cars, campsites, buildings. Dead trees are felled every day just to keep the forest safe, but there is only so much that can be done.\nThe bark beetle thought to have killed the sequoias, Phloeosinus punctatus, is different to the pine and spruce beetles that have claimed hundreds of millions of trees in Siberia, Europe and North America. But scientists are concerned about the classification of Phloeosinus and want further study.\nWhatever new information emerges, Brigham is clear: “I can see why people could be confused because we are standing in a bog looking at giant sequoias that we say were killed by drought. It also doesn’t help that we’ve been telling people for 100 years that drought, fire and insects don’t kill giant sequoias. And now what I’m telling you is that the combination of drought, fire and insects is killing giant sequoias.”\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"title":"Beetles and fire kill dozens of 'indestructible' giant sequoia trees","paragraph":"Giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on the planet – some more than three millennia old – have started dying from beetle attacks linked to the climate emergency, the preliminary findings of a new study have revealed.\nThe deaths of the trees, some of which lived through the rise and fall of hundreds of empires, caliphates and kingdoms – not to mention the inauguration of every US president – have shocked researchers in their speed and novelty.\n'This is not how sequoias die.

In addition to the beetle attacks, high-severity fires strengthened by drought and decades of natural wildfire suppression have killed 12 giant sequoias since 2015 in the national parks.\nThe deaths have challenged age-old assumptions about the tree, which only grows on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada and is fabled for its near-indestructibility, attracting visitors from across the world.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA girl plays in the gap that has appeared in a sequoia.

It’s never happened before,” said Dr Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science for Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, who oversees the welfare of ecosystems in the parks. “You think giant sequoias don’t die in fire, you think giant sequoias can’t be killed by insects. That’s not true any more.”\nAdvertisement\nAccording to more than 100 years of records preceding California’s 2012-16 drought, sequoia trees either died by falling over or suffering near total crown scorch in wildfires, never while standing upright. But since the historically hot and dry drought, researchers have recorded trees dying “from the top down” with the notable presence of bark beetles in their crown.\nAlthough the number of trees that have died is a small proportion of the approximately 6,000 sequoias in the park, Dr Nathan Stephenson, the US Geological Survey forest ecologist who conducted the research, said he expected more to succumb to beetle attacks if, as expected, droughts become more severe and frequent in the future due to the climate crisis.\n“I don’t expect a threshold to be passed, at least in my lifetime, when there’s suddenly gigantic outbreaks taking out whole groves of giant sequoias. I suspect it will be [beetles continuing to hit] the most stressed sequoias but they will be doing more sequoias, because there will be more stressed sequoias.”\nStephenson said while there were no beetle attacks marked in park records, he suspected it might have happened before “deep in history”, but more needed to be done to understand what the insects were doing to the trees.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPhloeosinus punctatus , the beetle responsible for the death of the trees, is just 3-4mm long.

The sequoia tree needs slow burning fire to reproduce, but decades of fire suppression has meant that burns have not taken place in some parts of the forest for over a century.\nAs a result, the buildup of fuel in the forest means that when fires do take place, they are more intense than usual, killing sequoia trees in the process.\n“For the sequoias that died in fires, it’s a combination of past management practices plus the hotter drought that ganged up to kill so many,” Stephenson explained. “Sequoias have died in past fires when it hasn’t been an extreme hot drought, but it was fewer. Again, it might be a warning shot across the bow that if it continues to warm as projected, you might get more severe, longer-lasting, hotter droughts and sequoias will be exposed to those kinds of wildfires.”\nTens of millions of trees have died across the US, ravaged by pests, wildfires and the effects of the climate crisis, research in August found. In February 2019, the US Forest Service announced 18m trees had died since 2017 in California, bringing the total to more than 147m for the years since the drought began in 2010.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Rental is a totally guilt-free way to wear the most beautiful dress and it’s not out of reach for people.”\nA £1,000 dress might rent for £100, which is not exactly cheap, but accessible to anyone who can afford a big night out with cocktails, dinner and a cab home, she says.\nShepherdson began by trying to start her own site but then met Sacha Newall and Tina Lake, who founded My Wardrobe HQ in June 2018, combining their experience in online fashion, car sharing, online marketplaces and women’s magazines: “It felt like a business that could scale.”\nMy Wardrobe HQ works by managing the whole rental process, including photography, delivery, cleaning and payment, for its clients. About half the items on offer come from individuals, half from brands.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nShepherdson says she is now in discussions with brands about producing collections specifically for rental. “Why not? It’s obviously a change but it’s just sharing a bit more, making sure you get away from that thing of buying something, wearing it once and moving on.”\nShe says the idea is particularly appropriate for luxury womenswear. Ski-wear, occasion wear, maternity clothing and childrenswear are other areas Shepherdson thinks are ripe for rental.\nQuick guide\nUK high street woes\nShow\nHigh street closures in 2019\nThousands of high street jobs have been lost in the last 12 months as a result of high profile retail administrations, and thousands more are at risk as Mothercare, Debenhams and Forever 21 prepare for closures.

But more than 100 jobs lost with the closure of 15 stores.\nPatisserie Valerie: Had 200 cafes employing nearly 3,000 people when an accounting scandal prompted the chain to call in administrators in January 2019. About 70 of the group’s 200 stores closed immediately with the loss of 900 jobs. About 2,000 jobs were saved when about 100 Patisserie Valerie cafes were rescued by Causeway Capital, more than 20 of which have since closed. 21 Philpotts sandwich shops were bought by AF Blakemore & Son. and four Baker & Spice cafes a were bought by the Department of Coffee & Social Affairs.\nSarah Butler\nPhotograph: Jill Mead\nWas this helpful?\nWhile Shepherdson says it’s unlikely she’ll go back to leading a fashion chain unless it’s one with strong sustainability credentials, she rues the troubles at Topshop and its fellow fast-fashion chains, particularly the loss of good jobs for young women.\n“It’s sad but there is a certain inevitability to it. Everything has changed, the whole approach to shopping.

While activist Greta Thunberg’s emotionally charged speeches around the globe have gained headlines so, too, has her decision to shun air travel in favour of train and boat journeys, no matter how arduous.\nWith flying one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions, more people are following Thunberg’s lead and rethinking the way they travel. But it’s not just about holidays – business trips are a big contributor to the problem, and discussions are taking place at companies up and down the UK about flying less and “clean travel” options.\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nBut with the value of the global business travel market forecast to increase from $1.3tn (£1tn) in 2017 to almost $1.7tn by 2023, according to an Allied Market Research report issued in November 2018, will large numbers of businesses really start to rethink the need to jet across from the UK to New York to set up a deal, or fly from London to Dublin for a meeting?\nThe often exorbitant cost of train travel means that in cold, hard financial terms, it might be difficult to argue against, say, a £40 return flight from London to Edinburgh versus £240 on the train.\nAnd what about long-distance commuting to work? This week’s media coverage of airline Flybe’s woes brought a reminder that many of its passengers are weekly commuters hopping on flights to and from mainland Europe.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRegional airline Flybe, which got into financial difficulties this week, is popular for long-distance commuting. Photograph: Ceri Breeze/Alamy\n“With more and more companies making their own ‘net zero’ pledges, business travel is bound to come under the spotlight before long,” says Cait Hewitt, deputy director of campaigning organisation Aviation Environment Federation. “We’re starting to get inquiries from the business travel-buying community (corporate travel buyers) to discuss what they should be doing about the impact of climate change on travel.”\nAdvertisement\nSome companies have taken action or are working on it, though it is fair to say that when Guardian Money tried to talk to large and medium-sized companies about business flights, many didn’t want to chat.\nHowever, some were prepared to spill the beans. London-based Lawson Conner, part of the IQ-EQ group, provides services and software to financial firms, and says it has reduced business flights by 75% over the last two years.\n“I used to fly quite a lot – I’d probably take about eight flights a month, travelling to Singapore and Hong Kong,” says Gerhard Grueter, co-founder and managing director of Lawson Conner, which employs 50 people in the UK. “That’s now completely cut.”\nThe business has a “one person” international travel policy, where only one member of staff is allowed to attend global business meetings.\nThe reduction in flights has, in part, only been possible because the company has offices around the world. “If clients are being served locally, if someone wants to speak to me, I don’t need to fly to New York – it’s not necessary,” says Grueter, adding: “If I was asked ‘what did you do in your job as a senior member in a firm, about the impact on the environment?’, I want to be able to respond. We have got to act now.”\nTwo years ago, the engineering professional services firm WSP set itself a target in the UK to become carbon neutral by 2025. This involved tackling business flights, which have seen a 9% fall domestically, and a 16% drop overall. In 2018 it introduced an initiative encouraging non-travel and low-carbon alternatives rather than driving and flying, and banned flights under 250 miles.\n“When our staff book travel online, a pop-up asks whether they need to travel or could they use Skype,” says Claire Gott, UK head of corporate social responsibility (CSR) at WSP. “Also, our admin staff have been trained to challenge any travel. The first choice is by rail.”\nThere’s also an internal carbon levy of £50 a flight on all domestic air travel, to be increased to £200 a trip, with this invested in CSR activities.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nZetteler staff at St Pancras station on their way to Milan Design Week\nSabine Zetteler, owner of communications agency Zetteler, is on a mission to reduce flights taken by her 10-strong company. Zetteler says the London-based business has clients exhibiting all over the world, so in some cases flying can’t be avoided, but for short trips and design fairs, it plans to find more carbon-efficient means.\nFor instance, in April 2019, five of the team travelled by train to Milan Design Week. “It took 12 hours longer and cost a few hundred extra financially, but it was liberating, bonding and important for us to try,” says Zetteler. As for this year, the company plans to visit fewer places and share the carbon offset charge for international meetings that can’t be avoided.\nOrganisations, such as universities, are also looking at what they can do. Sion Pickering, social responsibility and sustainability projects coordinator at Edinburgh University, says business travel accounts for a sizeable proportion of its carbon emissions. “In 2018 during term time, staff and students travelled more than 66m business miles, emitting more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent),” he explains. “This is approximately 20% of our carbon emissions, and our third highest source after emissions from the electricity and gas we use to heat and power our campuses.”\nThe university has already started discussions about whether the number of travellers can be reduced, and whether additional value can be found by extending trips slightly to combine multiple engagements.\n“By helping departments to understand how much they travel, we have started to increase awareness,” says Pickering. This year the university plans to introduce a series of measures to reduce emissions from business travel.\nA perk of taking the train: two extra days’ holiday\nSome businesses have signed up to Climate Perks, a new scheme that works with climate-conscious employers to offer at least two paid “journey days” per year to staff who travel on holiday by train, coach or boat instead of flying. These are for people to use to travel to and from their holiday destination. More than 30 companies have signed up so far, according to the charity Possible (formerly known as 10:10 Climate Action), which launched the scheme.\nThese are for people to use to travel to and from their holiday destination. Crucially, these days don’t come out of your annual leave allocation – so if, say, you get 25 days’ holiday a year, you get those extra travel days on top of that.\nMore than 30 companies have signed up so far, according to the charity. In return, employers receive accreditation “in recognition of their climate leadership”.\n“When it comes to cutting plane travel, the solution must be based in behavioural and social change because there is no real technological solution for cutting aviation emissions,” says Emma Kemp at Possible.\nAlthough it recently signed up to Climate Perks, the ethical insurer Naturesave launched a similar initiative more than a decade ago for trips to Europe. “In recent years we have seen it grow,” says the marketing manager, Nick Oldridge. “Over the period we have run the policy, a quarter of staff have taken advantage of the benefit each year, resulting in an additional one or two days’ annual leave per person.”\nWhile he concedes there is a cost associated with this, there are undoubtable benefits. “Those who use the scheme have reported they enjoyed their holidays more and rediscovered the pleasure of travel,” he says. “They are also proud of being able to demonstrate to their friends and relatives that they have an employer who takes environmental issues seriously.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAbha Wells enjoyed her overland trip so much she plans to take more.\nOne employee taking advantage of the scheme is finance manager Abha Wells, who has used it for trips to Scotland and Belgium during the past two years. “Not only was it better for the environment, but we were also able to take our bikes, which made it even better. Now the climate emergency has become so critical, I am planning to take more trips overland using the extra days from our policy.”\nWhile carbon offsetting is offered by airlines and others, Cait Hewitt of Aviation Environment Federation says this isn’t the answer to reducing emissions. “Offsetting might look like a cheap and easy response to the climate change impacts of business flights, but while a well-run scheme will do some good elsewhere in the world, it does nothing to solve the problem of aviation emissions.”\nAdvertisement\n“There are no green flights on the market today. Rather than offsetting, businesses should look hard at how to cut back on flight numbers, change staff expectations about flying, and then maybe put the money they have saved towards research and development into genuine solutions for zero carbon aviation, whether that’s zero carbon fuel, electric aircraft, or technologies for capturing and locking away CO2 from the air once it’s emitted.”\nSome of the things businesses and employees can do\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nTravelling on an overnight train can save money by avoiding the cost of a hotel room. Photograph: Jeff Holmes/Serco/PA\n• Think about whether it’s essential to travel. Could you join the meeting by conference or video call? Is there someone who lives or works nearer to the event or meeting who could go?\n• If you have to go, could you get there by train? Any extra costs compared with flying can sometimes be offset by travelling on an overnight train and avoiding the cost of a hotel room.\n• If you do fly, travel economy (a business class seat has around three times the CO2 impact compared with economy, as a result of the extra space and weight it occupies, says the Aviation Environment Federation).\n• Try to choose the most efficient airline for the route. As well as showing you prices, websites such as Skyscanner display which flights are “greener” because they emit less CO2. This calculation is based on aircraft type, capacity and number of stops.\n• Don’t encourage extra flying by letting staff keep air miles.

While no thinking human being could disagree with them, I find myself increasingly worried about the unthinking ageism that has crept into this movement.\nAt Davos we will tell world leaders to abandon the fossil fuel economy\nGreta Thunberg and others\nRead more\n“Young people are being let down by old people and those in power,” they declared, as though the fact that the most powerful people are old means that most old people are powerful. Clearly, they aren’t. In reality, swaths of older people have neither money nor influence, and also support the school climate strikes.\nWhat’s happening here, I think, is that some young climate activists have adopted the intergenerational unfairness narrative – the one that also blames old people for zero-hours jobs, soaring house prices and pretty much everything else that’s bad, apart from the overconsumption of avocados.\nIt’s the “OK, boomer” retort now applied to the climate, as expressed last month by the singer Billie Eilish: “Hopefully the adults and the old people start listening to us [about climate change]. Old people are gonna die, and don’t really care if we die, but we don’t wanna die yet.”\nBut stereotyping old people as “après moi, le déluge” types who don’t give a fig about what happens to the planet after they leave it is nonsense. The majority of parents and grandparents are deeply concerned about what they leave behind for their families. (And let’s not be parentist about it, as if only those with offspring care about the planet. Indeed, there are plenty of older people who chose not to have children because of their concern for the planet.)\nThe novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has warned of the dangers of the single story about another person or country, arguing that our lives are made up of many overlapping stories. “The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story,” she argued. This is what the youth climate narrative risks doing.\nPlay Video\n0:50\n'It's nice to meet you': Greta Thunberg and David Attenborough speak over Skype – video\nYoung climate activists have first-hand experience of ageism, having been admonished repeatedly (mostly by – yes! – old, white men) that they’re too young to know what they’re talking about. It would be a pity if they just flipped this over to stereotype older people. Indeed, over-65s grew up in pre-throwaway times and know all about keeping, repairing and reusing; we need those skills now more than ever.\nThey also have the freedom to imagine a better world: as the radical American anti-ageism campaigner Maggie Kuhn pointed out: “We the elders should be society’s futurists … we have nothing to lose.”\nOf course the single story makes good copy, and some youth climate strikers, such as Jamie Margolin, co-founder of the youth climate justice movement Zero Hour, in her admirable Ted Talk, are much more nuanced in their analysis. In reality, it’s not generations but structures of power and domination, systems of extraction and exploitation of people and planet for profit, that have brought us to this point of peril. Thunberg recognises this when she eloquently attacks the idea of untrammelled economic growth.\nPolarising old and young isn’t an effective long-term strategy. If climate activism is to stand any chance of succeeding, it needs to be intergenerational and multigenerational, based on the idea of stewardship of the commons – those resources shared by us all that we need to safeguard for future generations. That way we can be sure future generations will actually exist.\n• Anne Karpf is the author of How to Age, and professor of life writing and culture at London Metropolitan University\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But not, perhaps, in the Yorkshire village of Skipsea.\nResidents in the tiny seaside parish were warned this week that a large number of homes are at “imminent risk” of tumbling into the North Sea within 12 months because of the rapid erosion of the East Yorkshire coast.\nFor decades the picturesque seaside from Bridlington to Withernsea has been a haven for holidaymakers from across the country. But it is quickly becoming known for another reason: it is the fastest-eroding coastline in northern Europe.\nFigures published this week showed that parts of the coast were disappearing far faster than first thought. A combination of stormy weather and rising sea levels caused more than 10 metres of cliff to disappear from a 2-mile stretch of coast in just nine months last year, compared with the annual average of 4 metres. In just six months, three strips of coastline lost nearly double what they expected to lose in a year.\nOn Green Lane, residents are on the frontline of this unwinnable war with nature. “You can get up one morning and open your curtains and you’ve lost your fence, or your garden’s gone,” said Carly Davis, 30, whose rented chalet is one of more than 20 home at imminent risk of being swallowed by the sea in the next year.\nDavis, not her real name, points to the half-missing fence at the foot of her garden and the wet clay cliff, freshly-exposed by the waves. All along her street, huge chunks are missing from gardens and the cliff is just 9 metres from some people’s back doors. The main road that once led to their street now ends precipitously at the cliff edge. A bright red sign warns: “Danger. Cliffs subject to coastal erosion. DO NOT PROCEED.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nEnd of the road in Skipsea. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\nDavis moved into her rented home only two months ago so she could live next to her friends. Her son, 12, loves his seafront bedroom but they know it is not a forever home. “You sit here and the waves hit your window and you think: it’s getting close. You go check it for fresh soil all the time and you think: how long have I actually got left?”\nAdvertisement\nLooking out to sea, she mused: “It’s a monster, that thing, but then again it’s beautiful. You see the sunset and you think it’s gorgeous, then you hear the crashing waves and you think it’s a monster – it’s a destroyer.”\nAn abandoned amusement arcade stands at the end of Davis’s street, opposite a large hole where Skipsea beach social club served seaside drinkers for 80 years before it was demolished last year. There is no longer public access to the beach, though hardy residents have been known to clamber down ladders from their gardens in summer.\nThe erosion of Yorkshire’s soft clay coast is not a new phenomenon: about 30 villages have been lost to the sea since the Middle Ages. The steady nibbling away began about 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, but the global climate emergency has accelerated the process. Rising sea levels and more frequent volatile storms have seen huge chunks of land disappear in the past 20 years.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\n“You would have to be Donald Trump to say climate change isn’t happening,” said David Elvidge, who will chair an East Riding council meeting next week to discuss measures to protect homeowners. “There have been occasions on certain areas of the coast where a bad storm has taken in a single night what you would expect to go in three or four years.”\nThe average annual erosion rate remains about 2 metres a year for the whole 52-mile coastline. In Skipsea, there is anger that neighbouring towns and villages have been protected by sea defences but their parish, with its population of about 700, has not. Sea defences are decided on a cost-benefit analysis, with large urban areas and important industries prioritised over farmland and individual houses. On that basis, Skipsea must brave the waves.\n“There’s half a mile of land gone in 20 years,” said John Keay, 64, serving afternoon pints at the village’s newly-built social club half a mile inland. “You wouldn’t mind if they were trying to slow the erosion down but they’re not – they’re just letting it go. My argument is how far do you want it to go?”\nSome residents on Green Lane feel the council has not done enough to protect them from erosion or help them to move nearby. As it stands, they will also have to pay thousands of pounds towards the cost of demolishing their homes. Some have already chosen to leave but many of those who remain were too angry and upset to talk to journalists this week.\nOne 80-year-old man, whose wife died recently, said he had lived in his seaside bungalow for 25 years and could not imagine moving. “I’m losing my home. It’s been like this for seven years. I’m at my rock’s end with it,” he said. Another woman added: “I am really furious but I don’t want to talk. They have big meetings and get some money but nothing ever comes to us.”\nAs the tide moves towards her garden, Davis vowed to stay put for as long as she could: “The view, the community and the friends – we’re all a big family down here and we help each other. But you see people leaving and we’re getting less and less and less.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It’s the dead fish, the rotting vegetation and the ash from the fires and maybe the fire retardant. It is just like brown sludge.\n“I’ve been fishing the river for 50 years and I have seen fish kills before, but nothing of this magnitude. This will be happening in every east coast river that’s been hit by bushfires.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nRains have washed “tonnes and tonnes” of debris into the Macleay River, locals say. Photograph: Larry Newberry\nNewberry was critical of commercial fishing operations that had been catching Australian bass, and also the primary industry department for what he called its lack of response.\nAdvertisement\nSpecies seen dead and reported to Guardian Australia were Australian bass, eels, bullhead mullet, yellow-eye mullet, herring, gudgeons and catfish.\nUpstream from Kempsey at the town of Bellbrook, residents have been using pumps and hoses borrowed from firefighters to try and oxygenate the water.\nNewberry said he admired the efforts but feared it was “like pissing into a 40 kilometre an hour nor’easter”.\nJames Pritchard, a founder of the Bellbrook Social Fishing Club, said rain on Thursday evening had raised the level of the river, but had “brought tonnes and tonnes of debris and dirt with it”.\nHe said: “There’s more ash in the river now than I’ve ever seen before. The top of the river is covered in ash. The water looks like a runny cake mix. It’s terrible.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“The river is finished for generations – I won’t see this come back in my lifetime. To say I’m fucking gutted isn’t the word.”\nAboriginal elders relied on a healthy river for food and to teach culture, he said, and this would devastate those efforts.\n“This is so wrong. The DPI knew this was going to happen and they’ve put nothing in place,” he said.\nProf Lee Baumgartner, a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University, said the fish would have suffocated.\nAdding ash and nutrients to the water promotes bacteria, which in turn removes oxygen from the water. And if the water becomes sludgy, fish are not able to pass enough water over their gills to extract oxygen.\nEven though efforts to oxygenate the water might seem futile, he said even one saved mature female bass could then go on to spawn and lay hundreds and thousands of eggs.\nHe said there was a precedent for understanding the long-term impacts of an event such as this: major bushfires in 1939 had caused ash to run into the Lachlan River, and “the fish never recovered”.\nHe said: “I think we’ll see more of these events as it rains. These things can have decades of impact. It can be really terrible.”\nDavid Attenborough calls Australia's bushfires 'the moment of crisis' to address climate change\nRead more\nThe department’s “fish kills” page also has reports of hundreds of dead fish at Tilba Lake on the south coast of NSW, where soot had been reported on the banks, alongside dead bream, flathead, mullet, eels and blue swimmer crabs.\nAdvertisement\nDrought had also likely caused the death of thousands of fish in the Hastings River near Port Macquarie, the page reports.\nA NSW DPI statement said its fisheries department “continues to investigate a fish kill event on the Macleay River”.\nThe statement said: “The suspected cause of the incident is poor water quality leading to low dissolved oxygen. Rainfall events are adding ash from the extensive bushfires throughout the region into local catchments, as well as other organic matter and sediment. This can cause rapid drops to oxygen levels in the water.\n“Fisheries staff have conducted numerous field assessments and the main species affected have been Australian bass, freshwater mullet and eel-tailed catfish. The number of fish impacted is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.”\nCommunity members were encouraged to report fish deaths or observations to the Fishers Watch hotline on 1800 043 536.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It implied a constitutional right to a stable climate, and alleged that the government violated the public trust by failing to protect assets held in trust, notably the atmosphere.\nThe plaintiffs, now all between the ages of 12 and 23, also asked the US district court of Oregon to order the government to craft a climate remediation plan, one targeting scientifically acceptable standards to stabilize the climate.\nHarvard law students ramp up protest against ExxonMobil climate firm\nRead more\nOn Friday, the ninth circuit court found, however, that the court lacked the power to enforce such a plan or climate policy decisions by the government and Congress, concluding “in the end, any plan is only as good as the court’s power to enforce it”.\nNevertheless, the court found that the record “conclusively establishes that the federal government has long understood the risks of fossil fuel use and increasing carbon dioxide emissions” and “that the government’s contribution to climate change is not simply a result of inaction”.\nThe court also found that the youth met the requirements for standing in the case and that some of the plaintiffs met the requirements for actual injury.\nLevi Draheim, a 12-year-old plaintiff from Satellite Beach, Florida, the court found was injured by repeat evacuations from his home during worsening storms. Jaime Butler, 19, was injured by displacement from her home because of water security issues, separating her from relatives in the Navajo Nation, the court also found. The court also found that the plaintiffs proved their injuries were caused by the climate crisis.\nTwo of the three judges balked at the scope of change required to reverse climate breakdown, finding that halting certain programs would not halt the growth of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere or injuries to the plaintiffs.\n“Indeed, the plaintiffs’ experts make plain that reducing the global consequences of climate change demands much more than cessation of the government’s promotion of fossil fuels. Rather, these experts opine that such a result calls for no less than a fundamental transformation of this country’s energy system, if not that of the industrialized world … given the complexity and long-lasting nature of global climate change, the court would be required to supervise the government’s compliance with any suggested plan for many decades.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nKelsey Juliana, the lead plaintiff in Juliana v United States speaks at the supreme court in Washington DC. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\nKelsey Juliana, the 23-year-old named plaintiff in Juliana v United States and a resident of Eugene, Oregon, said she was “disappointed that these judges would find that federal courts can’t protect America’s youth, even when a constitutional right has been violated”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“Such a holding is contrary to American principles of justice that I have been taught since elementary school,” Juliana added. “This decision gives full, unfettered authority to the legislative and executive branches of government to destroy our country, because we are dealing with a crisis that puts the very existence of our nation in peril.”\n“We will continue this case because only the courts can help us,” Draheim told the Guardian following the ruling. “We brought this lawsuit to secure our liberties and protect our lives and our homes. Much like the civil rights cases, we firmly believe the courts can vindicate our constitutional rights and we will not stop until we get a decision that says so.”\nDistrict Judge Josephine L Staton, in a lengthy dissenting opinion, argued that courts do have the authority to protect the young in the face of climate breakdown, and should, given the government’s inaction: “In these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the United States has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response – yet presses ahead toward calamity. It is as if an asteroid were barreling toward Earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the nation.”\nThe court ordered the case be remanded to the district court and dismissed.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This will involve a 10-point plan that will be outlined in his manifesto before the mayoral election on 7 May.\nIn a speech to the Fabian Society new year conference in central London on Saturday, he is expected to say the 2030 target is essential to prevent the poorest communities being affected by poor air and the thousands of premature deaths in the capital each year.\nAdvertisement\n“My pledge to deliver a green new deal for the city with a target for London to be carbon-neutral by 2030 will help tackle the climate emergency and the air pollution crisis.\n“Some may say that a 2030 target isn’t achievable but I say we can’t afford not to try. This is a matter of social justice because it’s the poorest communities that are being hit hardest,” said Khan, who became the first Muslim mayor of any western capital city when he was elected in 2016.\nThe majority of the biggest political parties in the UK have set ambitions for the country to reach net-zero emissions by particular dates that range from the 2030s through to the 2050s.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nDespite Labour activists passing a commitment at their autumn party conference to work towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, the party ended up softening its pledge for last month’s election after pressure from trade unions and the impact it would have on industrial jobs.\nInstead they offered to find a “path” to the date of 2030.\nThe Conservatives have a policy of hitting net-zero by 2050 and the Liberal Democrats pledged a date of 2045. The Green party has pledged to go carbon-neutral by 2030.\nAcross Europe, three Nordic cities – Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm – have made firm commitments to be carbon-neutral or fossil fuel-free between 2025 and 2030.\nBristol has a net-zero target of 2030, as does Edinburgh, but with a backstop date of 2037.\nKhan has said green commitments will be a dividing line between his campaign and his nearest rival, Conservative Shaun Bailey, who is behind him in the polls.\nA survey by Queen Mary University of London’s Mile End Institute found Khan was the first preference candidate of 43% of Londoners. Bailey is on 23%.\n“The election on 7 May is a two-horse race between me and the Tory candidate,” Khan told the Guardian.\nTo achieve a carbon-neutral status for London, he said City Hall would lead the way in implementing tougher environmental standards, moving away from fossil fuels and reducing waste.\nPublic transport will become greener, he said, and he will commit to trying to get billions of pounds worth of government investment.

The hashtag #jagstannarpåmarken (which translates as #stayontheground) came into use around the same time, as groups sprang up to share tips.\nOther wealthy countries are not immune from such trends: a recent survey of 6,000 people in Germany, France, the UK and the US found 21% had cut back. Such a shift in attitudes makes it all the more disturbing that members of the current government, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have yet to catch up. Asked twice on the radio this week whether people should reduce the number of flights they take, the minister said they should not.\nAdvertisement\nThe Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has probably done more than anyone else to promote the idea that flying should, wherever possible, be avoided. In August she went to New York on a zero-emissions sailing boat. In Sweden last year, air passenger numbers fell by 5% as rail numbers went up. The German Green party (which topped 20% and doubled its seats in last year’s European elections) aims to make domestic flights obsolete.\nWith new research showing 2019 was the second-hottest year on record on the planet’s surface, and the hottest-ever for the oceans, it is increasingly difficult to understand why any rational person would not be behind all and any measures designed to reduce carbon emissions. Evidence of the growing danger extends from the devastation caused by the Australian bushfires to this week’s report that up to 1 million seabirds were killed in less than a year by a “hot blob” in the Pacific Ocean.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThis context made it particularly troubling to hear a senior UK government minister, and one generally considered to be on the moderate wing of his party, blithely deny that reducing flights is a good idea. Just as bad was the fact that his remarks came only hours after the announcement of a tax holiday and review of air passenger duty as part of a rescue deal to save the regional airline Flybe. Mr Hancock’s comment that “we should use technology to reduce carbon emissions” could be dismissed as naive if it was not so irresponsible.\nElectric flight is in its infancy and, while there have been significant gains in fuel efficiency, zero-carbon flight remains a remote prospect. Projections of future emissions consistently expect aviation to be responsible for an increasing share of the total, although the industry complains that it is unfairly singled out given that the current figure is 2.5%.\nThe UK, however, is a special case. Aviation is responsible for 7% of emissions now and is expected to overtake all other sources by 2050. Britons are the most frequent flyers to international destinations in the world, although a small minority are responsible for the vast majority of flights; by contrast, 48% reported in a recent government survey that they had not flown at all in the previous year. The US, meanwhile, has by far the heaviest air traffic (including domestic flights) overall, with the International Air Transport Association predicting that China will overtake it in about five years’ time – and global air traffic expected to double to around 8.2bn passengers annually by 2037.\nNo one wants remote locations such as some of those served by Flybe to be cut off, which is why the handful of routes deemed socially necessary are exempt from European state aid rules. But ministers should promote alternatives wherever possible. Hinting at a reduction in flight taxes when rail fares are rising by 2.7% sends the wrong message.\nIndividuals altering their habits, even in large numbers, will not avert disaster. In a sense the opposite is true: collective action by whole countries, led by governments, to push entire economies into a clean era is the answer. But “flight shame”, along with movements to restrict other carbon-intensive forms of consumption, is still a force for good. The point is not to show that you are better than other people, or to displace anxiety from the public realm into the private one. It is to show the world’s leaders, in business and politics, that we get it: life must change.\n• This article’s headline was amended on 18 January 2020 to better reflect the content of the article. The text was amended on 21 January to correct a reference to global air traffic potentially reaching “8.2bn flights” by 2037; the predicted figure relates to the number of air passengers, not flights.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This abuse amounts to an admission that the police do not know how to deal with XR. They are familiar with capturing those who avoid arrest. But many in XR welcome arrest as a way of highlighting the climate emergency.\nI was arrested during the October rebellion last year. As I was leaving Wood Green station, I overheard two police officers talking. One said to the other: “There must be a better way.

Even as David Attenborough warned of Earth’s “crisis moment”, the UK government rescued ailing airline Flybe on the basis that some people can’t get to work between Wales and Scotland or wherever any other way. Eventually, surviving businessmen will be able to row between mountain peaks, but for now corporate efficiency trumped the climate emergency.

The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, must be religious, on the basis he’s offered “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of Australia’s raging bushfires. In any reasonable theology, however, Morrison’s decision to serve in a cabinet that abolished the country’s climate commission, to slash fire and rescue budgets, and to ignore repeated concerns of fire chiefs would suggest he’s going to burn in hell. Or in Australia, which will probably be quicker.\nMusk, Bloomberg, Bezos: America's aristocracy of tech robber barons lives by its own rules\nJulia Carrie Wong\nRead more\nWatching the unprecedented fires provokes a strong sense that the Earth is bored with the series, and is fast-forwarding to the end.

Instead of seeing Mother Nature as a sort of ethereally benign matriarch, it would probably get more people in the right headspace if we thought of her as Medea, or Karen Matthews.\nMorrison has a spiritual twin in Richard Branson, who – as part-owner of Flybe – was one of the rescue plan’s impoverished beneficiaries. Branson’s private Necker Island has twice been ravaged by the effects of extreme weather events in the past few years, an eventuality that always sees him pose for angry but determined photos among the wreckage, presumably in a bid to garner sympathy. You own three fucking airlines, Richard. It’s like watching Dennis Nilsen whinge about his drains.\nPerhaps Richard will spend some of the funds the loan has saved him on suing the NHS again. Either way, the Flybe rescue has angered the Ryanair boss, Michael O’Leary, among others, who say it amounts to state aid. I’ve always nursed a sort of horrified respect for O’Leary, as one of the few mega-businessmen who declines to come out with his mask on. I’m certainly on board with his absolute refusal to give a toss about people flying to Warsaw for £8.99, who still go to the papers in outrage because he wouldn’t accommodate their cello in the cabin.\nSeven years ago, O’Leary applied to run test flights which would see strap-hanging standing passengers, and floated the idea of bunking travellers in the hull. A reminder that while you shudder at news stories of asylum seekers strapping themselves to landing gear, Michael sees the future of the Stansted-to-Tallin route. He’ll be around to mark the UK’s glorious freedom from oxygen, you can bank on it. Ditto Mark Francois, who will crowdfund any pearl divers who didn’t drown when the Philippines went under to swim down to the Atlantis of Westminster, and film themselves bringing a hammer silently to bear on the barnacle-encrusted Big Ben.Given all this, I’m tempted to call it touching that we seem to have outsourced the problem of what to do about humanity’s future to the likes of Elon Musk. But in the interests of accuracy, I probably have to alight on tragic and embarrassing. The tech moguls are a class of people we know are literally building post-apocalyptic compounds in New Zealand and who literally want to buy the blood of the young. They’ve murdered the entire concept of metaphor; they’re hardly going to stop at the population of Osaka.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMusk this week claimed he wanted to put a million people on Mars by 2050, explaining that “helping to pay for this is why I’m accumulating assets on Earth”. Sure. Boss it like a space pharoah. Alternatively, America might recall it’s seen guys like this before. Despite bewitching the government into giving him multi-multimillion-dollar contracts for warplanes throughout the second world war, Howard Hughes never produced and delivered a single one.\nAccording to Musk, there will be “plenty of jobs” on Mars. I bet there will. But given how absurd anyone connected with space exploration will tell you his scheme is, it’s probably time to accept that Elon’s more realistic 400-seater spaceship will be filled with female pop stars half his age who haven’t read the small print about their half of his contract to supply them with sustenance on Mars. The rest of us can look forward to his thruster engines scorching a simple farewell message into the last remaining bit of Earth yet to be burned: “BYE PEDOS”.\nThe ludicrous trust placed in Musk or Jeff Bezos or even Bill Gates derives from the fact we don’t really know what to do with the planet’s billionaires, who are richer by several orders of magnitude than Gilded Age titans like Andrew Carnegie. The obvious answer would be to tax them, but our stunning failure to do so is forcing us to insist they’re just perfect for the role of saviours. It’s difficult to think of a worse casting decision, except maybe that Bond movie where Denise Richards plays a nuclear physicist.\nThe times call for supranational cooperation. Instead of seeing the EU as its best hope, though, the UK will be begging for chlorinated scraps from a US president who has long dismissed the climate crisis as a hoax, and who recently enlivened his announcement of further deregulation by saying he’s found a book on climate change he’d like to read. The title of that book? Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero. He will naturally be bolstered by that certain stripe of US politician whose default take is that Greta Thunberg should be in school. One of their schools, presumably, to up her risk of facing an active shooter.\nSo yes, at this stage in the game, you have to think it would be quite the twist if capitalism ends up being the hero all along. Even the British Museum has asked one of its biggest sponsors, BP, to sit out a forthcoming exhibition: the display of 28,000-year-old archaeological treasures that have been revealed by the rapidly thawing Arctic permafrost. The Natural History Museum has swapped the famous dinosaur skeleton in its entrance hall for the blue whale, to focus minds on rising sea levels. Perhaps the British Museum could chuck a single-use defrosted mammoth out on their forecourt, then hope the smell reaches Westminster and “sparks a debate”.\nTactically benching BP shows the sort of dimly sentient self-awareness humanity should have been exhibiting in the 1980s. It’s a much-suppressed fact that humans had the knowledge and chance to stop global warming in its tracks in that decade, but were bested by their greatest enemy: more self-interested humans. So the moment was lost. And here we are. In retrospect, that was criminal insouciance on an existential scale – the planetary-level version of the time one of his staff asked Michael Jackson why he didn’t stop all this stuff with the young boys. Jackson’s reply was simple: “I don’t want to.”\n• Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The money will be shared between four charities: Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, Trees for Cities and Global Greengrants Fund UK.\nThe donations will be spent on initiatives promoting social and climate justice through natural climate solutions, from safeguarding rainforests in the Amazon basin to rewilding the Scottish Highlands and greening Britain’s towns, cities and countryside.\nAdvertisement\nKatharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian said: “It’s wonderful that our annual charity appeal has raised more than £1m for a cause that’s so clearly close to what our readers care about most.\n“Because of the outstanding generosity shown by Guardian and Observer readers, these inspiring charities will be able to protect and renew forests and green spaces, both across the UK and in the Amazon basin. Thank you to every single reader who donated – your generosity is so important.”\nEva Rehse, executive director of Global Greengrants Fund UK, praised readers for what she called a collective act of generosity and solidarity for the planet. “It gives us hope that we can tackle the collective challenge of the climate crisis together,” she said.\nGet Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals\nRead more\nSteve Micklewright, the chief executive of Trees for Life, said: “A huge Highland thank you to everyone who so generously donated.

Common themes were frustration with lack of government urgency in tackling climate change, and horror at the bushfires in Australia. Some said they had been inspired by the appeal to plant a tree in their garden.\nDonor Eileen Dale wrote: “I want to do my small bit to protect the environment, help the survival of species and mitigate the climate crisis for my grandchildren and all their peers around the world.”\nAnother donor, Ruth Baber, wrote: “I [contributed] my winter fuel payment because this is such an important issue.

The 2018 appeal for immigration charities which helped uncover the Windrush scandal raised £1.1m. In 2017 £1.7m was raised for youth homelessness, and £2.6m and £1.6m for refugee causes in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\nThe appeal closed at midnight last Sunday. The final total is expected to be slightly higher as a handful of stray cheques come in. The £1,015,000 figure includes estimated gift aid of £168,000.

The planet cannot afford a second term","paragraph":"W\nhat are the consequences of a second term of Donald Trump? To even consider the question sends the left-leaning mind into a paroxysm. Everything from nuclear war to the utter collapse of American democracy looms large in the imaginations of otherwise sober-minded people.\nTrump impeachment: president's legal team to include Bill Clinton investigator Ken Starr – as it happened\nRead more\nIn truth, the damage may be less immediately obvious. Life, in many ways, would go on. But the planet we inhabit will continue to heat up, and the most powerful government on Earth would be doing everything it can to further destabilize the environment around us. Just after the new year, the Trump administration announced it planned to radically revise the National Environmental Policy Act, a landmark measure that forced federal infrastructure projects to take into account their impact on the environment. Under the rewritten rules, builders of highways, pipelines, and other major infrastructure projects would no longer have to consider climate change when assessing their impact.\nAdvertisement\nIt is, without question, one of the most grievous blows Trump has inflicted since taking office three years ago. It follows more than 100 environmental rollbacks, including relaxing rules limiting emissions from coal plants and weakening protections for endangered species.\nFossil fuel projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline would have free rein, undaunted by court challenges that ruled the Trump administration didn’t properly consider climate change when analyzing the pipeline’s impact. The new rules would dramatically narrow which projects would require environmental review, with many infrastructure initiatives sailing through the approval process without having to disclose plans to discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.\nThe new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the “cumulative” consequences of new infrastructure, a requirement interpreted as a mandate to study the effects of ruinous greenhouse gas emission and rising sea levels. The act currently requires the federal government to prepare detailed analyses of projects that could have major environmental effects.\nIt was a Republican, Richard Nixon, who enacted the law in 1970 after the heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire and a tanker spilled 3m gallons of crude off the coast of California. Though Nixon was a perpetual villain for leftists of the era, he created the Environmental Protection Agency, developing the crucial regulations under attack today. Even conservatives at the time acknowledged that the government had a role to play in being stewards of the environment we all share.\n'There are no excuses left': why climate science deniers are running out of rope\nRead more\nWe are in a new, terrifying age. Trump’s Republican party is far more savagely conservative than any version that came before it. It’s important to understand that the shredding of environmental regulations is not something that would have been unique to a Trump presidency, unlike his Twitter inanities or nonstop campaign rallies. The Koch brothers and other billionaire funders of the Republican party have been dreaming of the day they could again control the executive branch to pursue an agenda of environmental destruction.Trump presides over a party that denies the existence of climate change, that rejects science itself. There are few equivalents elsewhere. Even Boris Johnson’s Conservatives acknowledge there is a climate crisis afoot. But had Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio won the presidency in 2016, the assault on the EPA would have commenced as expeditiously as it is now. Perhaps they, like Trump, would have named a coal lobbyist to lead the agency.\nAdvertisement\nFour years of damage can be undone. Eight is far more difficult. The Democrats running for president, and the millions who will go to the polls this fall, must understand the planetary stakes. A functioning EPA is essential to reversing the worst effects of climate change, which are very likely to be felt at the cataclysmic rate the planet is warming.\nIf Trump has eight years in power, fossil companies will have carte blanche to profit off environmental destruction for a very significant amount of time. The next Democratic president will not only have to undo Trump’s damage but rapidly play catch-up as the world races to secure a future for the human race. The doomsday clock is ticking.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

If this bushfire crisis, this nation-wide trauma, can’t loosen the denialists’ grip on Coalition climate policy, then maybe nothing will.\nThat would mean everyone sifting through Scott Morrison’s verbiage for signs that he might really be intending to change direction is searching in vain, because he’s just trying to talk himself out of political trouble.\nIt would mean everyone patiently pointing out that the prime minister could quite easily “evolve” his current policies into something that actually reduced Australia’s greenhouse emissions could save their breath, because that isn’t the kind of evolution he is considering.\nAnd it would mean there’s no point reprising the facts, that Australia’s emissions are flatlining, not falling, that we could seize an economic advantage in a low-carbon world and at the same time help the globe avoid the all too obvious costs of inaction. The Coalition cabal who apparently still call the shots thinks climate science is “voodoo”. They’re impervious to facts. They are already threatening, via anonymous quotes to the Australian, to “blow the place up”. Again. Just like they’ve been blowing up national climate action for more than a decade.\nGrief, frustration, guilt: the bushfires show the far-reaching mental health impacts of climate change\nFiona Charlson\nRead more\nAnd as this week’s Guardian Essential poll showed, despite the widespread sense that the fires are a tipping point, despite global outrage at the self-defeating stupidity of our policies, despite the world’s largest fund manager ditching thermal coal, despite the wave of grief and anger from around the world – even from James Murdoch – it’s still not clear that Australian public opinion will force this government to change.\nSure, Morrison’s mishandling of this crisis has cost him. His overall approval ratings have dived but his numbers have held fairly steady in his base. The strategists – who always pay more heed to those numbers than to other benchmarks, like, say, a country in ashes – no doubt believe that, with enough confusing obfuscation about “meeting and beating” targets, enough revising of the figures, enough serious practical efforts to help burnt-out communities, and just enough rhetoric conceding the reality of global heating, all will be well in time, without promising to do anything about it. All will be well for the poll numbers that is. Not for the nation.\nThis is not, repeat not, an argument for abandoning the arguments in favour of climate action. It is not a counsel to cop out in despair. The federal government has a responsibility to the country, and to its international commitments, to enact policies to reduce Australia’s emissions to net zero by 2050. That job gets harder the longer it delays. Every concerned citizen, and every frustrated investor, and every heartbroken lover of Australian nature, and every worried parent or grandparent, and every justifiably furious child should maintain that rage.\nBut we are also running out of time. So perhaps we should simultaneously consider a plan B – solutions that bypass the federal government. Not ideal, but needs must.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nMaybe the many Liberals who understand climate science will persuade Morrison to act. Maybe the majority of federal politicians across all parties will take the former Labor minister Greg Combet’s advice and unite on this one issue, in the national interest. Maybe they will support the bill introduced by the independent Zali Steggall.\nMany of the drivers of greenhouse emissions are actually the responsibility of the states – urban transport, land use, electricity generation and transmission. And most of the states have already accepted that emissions need to reach net zero by 2050 and are in the process of deciding on interim targets and policies to meet them.\nIf they collaborated, the states could go a long way to enacting the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee – the one that Morrison as treasurer whole-heartedly supported – and which also had the support of Australian business and pretty much every stakeholder.\nAfter Morrison overthrew Malcolm Turnbull and ditched the Neg, the Business Council of Australia, desperate for someone to do something, was actually canvassing how companies could “go it alone” , agree on on framework to just start getting on with it, and that idea is still under discussion in business circles.\nA bunch of billionaires are backing massive renewable energy export policies despite the lack of a coherent climate and energy policy.\nIt would obviously be better for the federal government to fulfil its responsibilities, to do its job, but maybe it’s time to concede that may never happen, and for the states, and the business community, to look for ways to work around it.\nWe’ve actually been in this position before.\nIn the late 2000s, despairing in the face of an intransigent Howard government, the New South Wales government introduced one of the world’s first mandatory greenhouse emission trading schemes and the premiers set up a taskforce to collaborate on turning it into a national system.\nBut then, trailing in the polls and watching community concern mount as the millennial drought dragged on, John Howard dramatically reversed his government’s long-standing sceptical stance and, in June 2007, announced details of a carbon trading scheme he would introduce if re-elected. “Being among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will present new opportunities for Australia. And we intend to grasp them,” he said, and many people believed him.\nThe bushfire crisis has shown a way forward for Australia – and revealed who we truly are\nVan Badham\nRead more\nBut, long out of office, in 2013 he admitted his shift had been purely opportunistic. His government had hit a “perfect storm”, because of the drought, the ground-breaking report by Sir Nicholas Stern and the Inconvenient Truth movie by the former US vice-president Al Gore, but he didn’t really think there was anything “significant” or “damaging” about greenhouse emissions, and concern about global warming was really just a “substitute religion”.\nAs we know, Labor won the 2007 election and eventually, after much political pain, introduced a carbon price, at which point the NSW government closed its scheme, but then the Abbott government repealed the carbon price (it called it a tax, although Tony Abbott’s chief of staff later admitted this was just another piece of political opportunism) and replaced it with, well, with nothing much at all. And that’s where we sit, stalled, as the climate emergency happens around us.\nMaybe, under the current political pressure, something will give. But we’ve been fooled before and there’s no time to be fooled again. So that means it’s time to think of ways around the federal Coalition’s intransigence, because those deniers will never be swayed, and we can’t allow them to dictate our future.\nLenore Taylor is editor of Guardian Australia\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Since 2012, Microsoft has assessed the fee on direct emissions, electricity use and air travel, among other activities, but it will now expand the fee to cover all Microsoft-related emissions.\nAdvertisement\nThe effort “will require technology by 2030 that doesn’t fully exist today”, the company president, Brad Smith, said.\n“That money is used, then, for us to invest in our work to reduce our carbon emissions,” he said.\nMicrosoft’s co-founder Bill Gates was an early backer of the British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, one of a handful of companies developing direct air capture technology.\nThe company’s plan also includes the creation of a climate innovation fund, which will invest $1bn over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology.\nMicrosoft “is at the helm of what could be a new movement towards negative emissions”, Elizabeth V Sturcken of the Environmental Defense Fund, a not-for-profit advocacy group, said in a statement.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“A company’s most powerful tool for fighting climate change is its political influence, and we’re eager to see Microsoft use it,” she added.\nMicrosoft’s announcement comes as big investors pay more attention to how companies will tackle climate change, and as employees are putting growing pressure to do more.\nIn November, more than 1,000 Google workers signed a public letter calling on their employer to commit to an aggressive “company-wide climate plan” that includes canceling contracts with the fossil fuel industry and halting its donations to climate change deniers. Several Amazon employees have banded together to call for climate action. And thousands of tech workers participated in the September 2019 global climate strike, including contingents from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and Square.\nMicrosoft and Amazon have come under fire from activist tech workers who have demanded that they stop supplying technology to oil and gas companies because of the polluting nature of fossil-fuel extraction.

There really are more pressing issues, Journal, 8 January). But suggesting we remove nuclear weapons from the conversation ignores how intertwined these two existential threats are.\nGenerations of climate scientists have documented that a nuclear war could cause drastic climatic disturbances and global famine. Last year scientists found that the use of a few hundred weapons (less than 10% of today’s global nuclear arsenals) could nearly stop all rain over India and central China, and reduce global precipitation globally by 15%-30%. It would take over a decade to return to rainfall levels before the nuclear war.\nNuclear weapons destroy the climate even when they are not used. Nuclear weapons facilities – not unlike the oil and gas companies exacerbating the climate crisis – have contaminated land and water around the world with waste that will last far beyond even our grandchildren’s lifetimes.\nAdvertisement\nClimate change could actually make nuclear war more likely. Increased resource scarcity increases the chance of conflict, according to a growing body of research.\nThe unacceptable humanitarian and environmental consequences of nuclear weapons and the ever-growing risk of nuclear use led 122 countries to vote to ban them in 2017. Today the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons has 34 ratified states and 80 signatories – and counting.\nSo perhaps, as Rachel suggests, we should not be asking whether candidates would push the button to launch nuclear weapons. Instead we should join the world’s majority of countries and ask when they will take the nuclear button off the table for good.\nAlicia Sanders-Zakre\nInternational Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

What it really needs is regulation","paragraph":"L\net’s not beat about the bushfires. It’s not the impacts of climate breakdown on our ecosystems or the world’s poorest in the global south that worries Larry Fink, the CEO of that financial behemoth BlackRock. No, what really worries him and his shadow banking peers is the “fundamental reshaping of finance” threatened by climate protesters, and what this means for his company’s interests.\nFink made headlines this week with his annual letter to CEOs, which put the climate emergency front and centre. Acknowledging the risks that it poses to markets, and announcing that his fund will no longer invest in companies that generate more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal production, his letter was hailed as a landmark move. But, before we get too laudatory, it’s worth asking: what is BlackRock?\nThe US company is the world’s biggest asset management fund. 63% of the staggering $7tn financial assets it manages originates in the Americas and 29% in Europe. In the UK (as far as we know) BlackRock manages £16.5bn of local government pensions, as well as at least £3.8bn of Transport for London’s pension fund.\nBlackRock’s management of our savings takes place largely in a globalised sphere known as the shadow banking sector. In the past, most savings were placed in carefully regulated high-street banks and other savings institutions. Today, many of these functions have migrated toward shadow banking.\nThis sector is made up of institutions (including pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds) that use securities (a tradeable bundle of debt or equities) as collateral in a modern form of credit creation. BlackRock, backed by $7tn of the world’s savings, also provides traditional banking services across the international financial system. Asset management funds such as BlackRock operate beyond democratic borders and are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional banks.\nIn his letter, Fink acknowledges that “the money [BlackRock] manages is not [its] own”. “Last September,” he continues, “when millions of people took to the streets to demand action on climate change, many of them emphasised the significant and lasting impact that it will have on economic growth and prosperity – a risk that markets to date have been slower to reflect. But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.”\nBut the “shape of finance”, especially in the shadow sector, remains essentially the same: it spews out massive quantities of credit – forms of new money – much of it aimed at speculative activity. The Financial Stability Board reckons that at the end of 2017 shadow banks generated $184tr in financial assets. This money is then used to invest in the real economy of consumption and production – and in the fossil fuel sector. As Bill McKibben, leader of the campaign group, 350.org, writes, without asset management companies such as BlackRock, “fossil-fuel companies would almost literally run out of gas”; what’s more, the company is the “world’s largest investor” in coal, oil and gas companies, and in those “driving deforestation”.\nWhen it comes to growth versus green, the short-term view always prevails\nLarry Elliott\nRead more\nWhile it is significant that Fink has publicly acknowledged the risks that climate breakdown poses to his and other companies, that is surely not the only point. The real concern is that the world’s politicians and regulators have allowed this behemoth to scoop up our savings, while turning a blind eye to how those savings are managed. This, in turn, has fuelled the creation of vast amounts of credit and debt, which has made the global financial system unstable and fragile. The shadow banking sector is much, much larger than it was after the Lehman Brothers collapse – a collapse precipitated in part by Lehman’s activities in the shadows.\nAdvertisement\nIf we are to save the planet, then we must begin by switching off the giant tap of unregulated credit. Fink is right: a “fundamental reshaping of finance” is what climate protesters want as the order of the day. But self-regulated divestment is not enough. The “reshaping” needs to be democratically enforced and accountable. We must ensure that companies such as BlackRock are brought back down to Earth and properly regulated by public authority. We have to do this if we are to redirect investment into the transformation of economies away from their addiction to fossil fuels and into more sustainable transport, energy and land-use systems.\n• Ann Pettifor is director of Prime: Policy Research in Macroeconomics and a fellow of the New Economics Foundation\n• This article was amended on 17 January 2020 to clarify that 63% of the assets managed by BlackRock originates in the Americas and 29% in Europe, rather than BlackRock managing about 60% of the savings of all Americans, and about 30% of the savings of Europeans\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Until they were found, they were a species clinging to the edge of the precipice of extinction – just one disaster away from vanishing.\nA quarter of a century for a species with a lineage going back to the age of dinosaurs is not even a fraction of a millionth of a blip.\n'Dinosaur trees': firefighters save endangered Wollemi pines from NSW bushfires\nRead more\nAnd given the monumental effort that has gone into saving this desperately endangered wild population it is highly likely that had they not been found in 1994, then the past few months would have seen them wiped out without anyone ever knowing they still existed. The miracle of their discovery has become the miracle that has saved them – for now.\nI remember the day in a Sydney newsroom almost 20 years ago when an editor at the paper where I worked at the time heard that I was writing a book about the Wollemi pines. Even though the trees’ discovery in 1994 made news on front pages around the world, my boss walked over to my desk, looked me in the eye and said: “No one is going to read a fucking book about a tree.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA former director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Carrick Chambers, described the discovery of Wollemi pines as ‘the equivalent of finding a small dinosaur alive on Earth’. Photograph: AP\nAdvertisement\nImplicit in what he said was that no one cared about Wollemi pines enough to read a book about them.\nHow wrong he was, was demonstrated this week as dramatic news emerged that the trees had been saved from the firestorm of the vast Gospers Mountain fire and people rejoiced.\nTo see the photos of the ribbon of green of the Wollemi pines, surrounded by the charred towering clifftops and ridgelines, was a rare moment of joy and relief for a community that has watched so much destroyed during the past few months.\nPlay Video\n0:55\nPrehistoric Wollemi pines saved by firefighters from Australia's bushfires – video\nWhen I visited the canyon in 1997 I was taken in by helicopter wearing a blindfold and then abseiled into a deep and dark prehistoric environment that was absolutely soaked and waterlogged. At the time it seemed impossible that such a place would ever burn. Now it seems impossible that it didn’t.\nThe Wollemi pine has been a story that has captured people’s imaginations. It is a tale of high adventure and academic excellence. First, there was a dramatic canyoning exploration trip that led to its discovery, then scientific detective work to determine exactly what that 40-metre-tall tree found by Noble actually was, followed by the quest to understand how it survived unnoticed, so close to Sydney.\nPerhaps the significance of the discovery was best captured by a quote given to me by the then director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Carrick Chambers, on the day the discovery was announced: “This is the equivalent of finding a small dinosaur alive on Earth.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nThe Wollemi pines have a lineage dating back to the age of dinosaurs and were on the precipice of extinction before they were found. Photograph: AP\nWhat Chambers was alluding to and that most people don’t realise is that Wollemi pines are time travellers from a different Australia, from a warmer and wetter planet. Their history stretches back more than 100m years and they have survived natural climate change that has seen temperatures swing dramatically and sea levels rise and fall by hundreds of metres, multiple times.\nThe trees tell the story of almost unimaginably deep time. Once, instead of gum trees, Gondwana – of which Australia was a small part – was covered in immense forests of Wollemi pines and their close relatives. These ancient trees deposited so much pollen that it is still found as fossils around the southern hemisphere, retrieved by geologists who find evidence of the trees in cores, from places like Bass Strait, that are kilometres thick.\nThen, 10m years ago, the trees begin to vanish from the fossil pollen record and two million years ago they disappeared altogether, indicating that the climate had shifted in a way that made their widespread survival untenable.\nSince then, as the planet shifted towards icier, colder, drier conditions, any surviving populations of the trees would have slowly shrunk, become separated and forced to retreat into the last refuges of wet deep rainforest canyons. After people arrived in Australia and widespread burning was practised, their fate was sealed to imprisonment in a single deep gorge.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nIntensive water-bombing and the installation of emergency irrigation by firefighters has allowed the trees to survive. Photograph: HO/AFP via Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nIt is hard, after this week, to consider the remaining original Wollemi pines as wild. Only intensive water-bombing, the installation of emergency irrigation and the intervention of determined firefighting has allowed them to survive until the next threat. The trees are now dependent on us for their survival. And it’s not just our efforts to protect the canyon where they survive, it is also about the research that has seen millions of trees cultivated and sold commercially around the world. It is about the creation of back-up populations in other similar canyons in the greater Blue Mountains.\nIt is also about the ongoing effort to keep the location of the trees secret and protected from fungal pathogens.\nThe fact that out of this catastrophe, Wollemi pines have become a symbol of survival and all that is good about what we can do when we are determined to protect something, shows that all is not lost as human-made climate change tightens its grip.\nJames Woodford is the author of The Wollemi Pine: The Incredible Discovery of a Living Fossil from the Age of the Dinosaurs, Text Publishing\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The brands, including Samsung, L’Oreal and Decathlon, were unaware that their adverts were being played before and during the videos.\n“This is not about free speech, this is about the free advertising YouTube is giving to factually inaccurate videos that risk confusing people about one of the biggest crises of our time,” said Julie Deruy, a senior campaigner at the group. “YouTube should not feature, suggest, promote, advertise or lead users to misinformation.”\nFor the report, Avaaz examined videos pushed to users when they search “global warming”, “climate change”, or “climate manipulation” on the site, focusing particularly on those giving high prominence by YouTube’s recommendation algorithms. It found that 16 of the top 100 videos on the first term contained misinformation, as did eight of the videos found under “climate change” and 21 of those under “climate manipulation”.\n“YouTube has previously taken welcome steps to protect its users from anti-vaccine and conspiracy theories,” Avaaz argued, “but has not acted with equal force against broader misinformation and disinformation content, including climate misinformation.”\nThe group called on YouTube to implement new policies to prevent the further spread of climate misinformation on its platform. It said the site should:\nInclude climate misinformation in its “borderline content” policy, which limits the algorithmic distribution of videos that do not reach the bar required to fully remove them from the site.\nDemonetise misinformation, “ensuring such content does not include advertising and is not financially incentivised. YouTube should start immediately with the option for advertisers to exclude their ads from videos with climate misinformation.”\nWork with independent fact-checkers to inform users who have seen or interacted with verifiably false or misleading information.\nProvide transparency to researchers by releasing data showing how many views are driven to misinformation by its own recommendation algorithms.\nIn a statement, YouTube said Avaaz’s report had its own transparency problems. “We can’t speak to Avaaz’s methodology or results, and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives. YouTube has strict ad policies that govern where ads are allowed to appear and we give advertisers tools to opt out of content that doesn’t align with their brand.

We continue to expand these efforts to more topics and countries.”\nA L’Oréal spokeswoman said: “The information promoted by these videos is in direct contradiction with L’Oréal’s commitments and the work we have been carrying out for many years to protect the environment.

Ted Wells Jr, a partner at the New York firm, is a prominent Democratic donor.\nDuring a reception at an upscale restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a group of students unfurled a banner reading “#DropExxon” and began chanting over a speaker from the firm that they wouldn’t work for Paul Weiss as long as the firm worked for Exxon. They live-streamed the event.\nThe protest follows another demonstration at the Harvard-Yale football game in November, when students from both universities swarmed the field at half-time.\nThe protesters say they want to bring accountability to the legal world, where attorneys traditionally have been expected to accept that all entities deserve representation regardless of their deeds. The action is especially jarring because the field’s culture dictates professionalism.\nOrganizer Aaron Regunberg said the protest action will be a shock to the Harvard Law School community, where students are taught that their job requires them to remain neutral about the actions of clients.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“But if you don’t start these conversations – if you don’t start forcing people to reckon with the reality of what the work that Paul Weiss is doing for Exxon, for example, means – then there’s never going to be any change,” Regunberg said. “And it’s clear from the science that we have just a few years left to address climate change.”\nAsked how he would explain his participation to future employers, Regunberg said: “I went to law school because I believe in the power of our legal system to be a force for good, and using aggressive tactics to enable corporate polluters to literally continue lighting our future on fire to me is the antithesis of what lawyers should do.”\nPaul Weiss successfully defended Exxon against a lawsuit from New York’s attorney general alleging the company misled investors about climate regulation risks. The publication Law.com named the firm’s lawyers “litigators of the week”, for delivering a “cool win” for Exxon in the $1.6bn suit.\nThe firm has also initiated suits against the state government officials bringing cases against Exxon, accusing the top lawyers in Massachusetts and New York of an alleged illegal conspiracy.\nOne judge dismissed those allegations, writing that the relief Exxon sought was an “extraordinary” attempt to “to stop state officials from conducting duly-authorized investigations into potential fraud”, based on “extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences” that are altogether “implausible”.\nThe Guardian has contacted Paul Weiss for comment.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The rescue of the struggling regional airline is “a blatant misuse of public funds”, thundered the boss of IAG, owner of British Airways, as he made an official complaint to the European commission.\nThat’s the same IAG, note, that enjoys a feather-bedded life thanks to its control of 56% of the landing slots at Heathrow, the most capacity-constrained airport in Europe. BA doesn’t get a leg-up via grubby Flybe-style negotiations with ministers but, if the airline industry wasn’t so riddled with politics, and if flag-carriers didn’t enjoy such lobbying power, IAG’s share of landing slots at Heathrow would have been capped at 30% a long time ago.\nBritish Airways owner files complaint over Flybe bailout\nRead more\nThe continued existence of Flybe maddens Walsh for a couple of reasons, one suspects. First, it is partly owned by the hated Virgin Atlantic. Second, Flybe indirectly secured a few slots at Heathrow via the fallout from BA’s takeover of British Midland in 2012; the competition authorities, in a rare act of resistance, took the view that BA was big enough already at London’s main airport and domestic consumers would benefit from greater choice. Walsh is not a voice of impartiality on Flybe.\nNone of which is to deny that there are big questions to be answered about the rescue package. The Virgin-led Connect consortium has yet to explain how much money it has invested since it bought the assets for a mere £2.8m less than a year ago, and why crisis has arrived so soon. Making money from regional aviation is hard, as evidenced by Flybe’s many problems over the years, but that’s a reason to have a better plan B than begging for a deferral of an Air Passenger Duty (APD) bill and a short-term loan.\nIt may be that the Connect crew is dysfunctional. Virgin Atlantic, 49%-owned by US carrier Delta, is mostly interested in delivering passengers to Heathrow and Manchester for transatlantic flights. Stobart would like more flights out of its Southend airport. Cyrus Capital, an obscure US investment firm, may have viewed the Flybe takeover as a short-term punt that could be abandoned if it threatened to become expensive.\nThose caricatures may be exaggerated, but the government is taking a risk in backing, even for a while, a consortium that looks fundamentally unstable. The fact that a review of APD has suddenly been thrown into the mix says this is a case of policymaking on the hoof.\nYet it’s hard to say definitively that the government has done the wrong thing. If the aim is to ensure that Flybe survives until the peak summer season, that’s not so silly. The approach buys time to develop a coherent strategy. By contrast, the instant demise of Flybe would have been followed, almost certainly, by crises at several regional airports. The government’s ability to implement any policy would have evaporated.\nWhat would a sensible strategy look like? Well, there’s certainly a case for redesigning APD as a tax on emissions, rather than being a per-passenger charge. A straightforward reduction in APD – in other words, a pro-flying bung at a cost to the public purse – would make a mockery of the UK’s carbon-reduction ambitions.\nAs for regional connectivity, the important thing is that the government doesn’t become beholden to Flybe’s unreliable owners. If it is really essential (a debate in itself) to run uncommercial flights between regions, let operators pitch for low-margin management contracts. Flybe doesn’t have to get the gig.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nMost of all, though, make the current help for Flybe transparent. A short-term sticking plaster could be a pragmatic fudge, whatever Walsh says, especially if it means Flybe is more likely to pay its APD liability in full. But any deal that underwrites the current owners would be completely unacceptable. “The government has not given any state aid to Flybe,” says the business department. Let us hope that statement is true. And, if it is, make sure it stays true.\nExpect Davos carbon neutrality to be drowned out by private jets\nAdvertisement\nStill on aviation matters, here comes the World Economic Forum to claim that its Davos shindig will be a carbon-neutral event this year.\nMaybe it will be, but it’s safe to assume that many of the big-name participants from business, banking and politics will arrive in Switzerland via private jet. It happens every time, and instantly undermines all the worthy speeches about tackling the climate emergency.\nThe aim this year, by the way, is to produce a manifesto for “a cohesive and sustainable world”. Of course it is.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But his comments attacking the family business’s record on climate crisis coverage – which blindsided other parts of the family – suggest he may have picked up a few pointers from the HBO show.\nThe declaration that he and his wife, Kathryn, felt “frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage” of the climate crisis, particularly the “ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary”, focused an awkward light on the family’s businesses – but could help James differentiate himself from his father, Rupert, and brother, Lachlan.\nAdvertisement\nHis statement raised eyebrows, not least because until 18 months ago James was at least nominally responsible for Fox News output as boss of its parent company. He is also still a director of News Corp, which owns the family’s newspaper interests. Peter Barnes, a board member, said the board had yet to discuss the comments.\nBut making a public stand on the issue has also helped the 47-year-old make clear to the wider world that he is heading in a different direction from the family business, as he looks to make investments in media companies with a more liberal standpoint. He has already donated to the US presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, joined the board of Elon Musk’s Tesla, and made clear he wants to distance himself from the conservative outlets associated with his surname.\nSign up to the Media Briefing: news for the news-makers\nRead more\nAlice Enders, of media analysts Enders, suggested Murdoch had always had a genuine and sincere concern about environmental issues throughout his career: “He and his wife believe in this so fundamentally and so strongly. They obviously believe that the media has a very important role in this.”\nShe added: “It’s very unusual to decide that the public domain is the best place to air a difference of views.”\nThe move caps a long journey for an individual who has often seemed uneasy with his enormous privilege, without ever rejecting it. After dropping out of Harvard in the mid-90s and working as a cartoonist, he helped to run the pioneering New York hip-hop record label Rawkus Records, providing funding for the operation. According to one person who visited the offices in this period, the twentysomething had “pierced ears and eyebrow, dyed hair, a goatee, and a poster of Chairman Mao on his wall in New York”, apparently rebelling against his family while also using its funds to subsidise his interests.\nAfter exiting the music industry – having sold a majority stake in Rawkus to his father – he was brought into the family business, having a brief stint advising on internet investments during the dotcom boom, followed by a spell running Asian pay-TV operator Star. But he shocked the British media scene when he was appointed as chief executive of BSkyB, a listed FTSE 100 company, at the age of 30.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAl Gore speaks at the UN climate change conference in 2018 in Katowice, Poland. Photograph: Grzegorz Celejewski/Agencja Gazeta/Reuters\nIt was during this time that he became increasingly concerned about climate change, inviting former US vice-president Al Gore to give a talk on the topic, and was an early convert to making businesses carbon neutral. Following a stint at the European arm of News Corp – where he was in charge as the phone-hacking scandal ravaged its newspapers and forced the closure of the News of the World – he became chief executive of 21st Century Fox until it was sold to Disney at the end of 2018.\nWhile there had been suggestions that James – until recently seen as the heir apparent – would join the combined behemoth, he instead walked away with billions of dollars. In the process, he left his brother in charge of a new, much smaller, Fox Corporation, which controls a group of television channels including Donald Trump’s favourite outlet, Fox News.\nEnders said that Murdoch’s approach to the environment contrasted with his father’s focus on profits at all costs. While it would be hard for the likes of Fox News to U-turn on the issue of the climate crisis, she suggested it could encourage journalists within the organisation to voice their concerns about coverage: “There’s a lot of people who are going to be standing up at News Corp meetings making these points.”\nIndividuals who have worked with Murdoch at BSkyB insist that his commitment to environmental issues is sincere, while also pointing to the influence of his wife, Kathryn, who put her name to the joint statement. In recent days she has used Twitter to share links to stories about investment company BlackRock putting climate change at the centre of its investment strategy and a story in the Murdoch-owned New York Post suggesting conservatives have answers to climate change.\nShe also linked to an article in Vice – an outlet in which James’s company recently bought a minority stake – blaming the bosses of large fossil fuel producers for the bushfires in Australia.\nThe piece is withering about claims that arsonists are responsible for the natural disaster unfolding in Australia, mocking “Rupert Murdoch’s rightwing media outlets” for spreading such claims, which have “been given a huge platform in the US by Donald Trump Jr and Sean Hannity” – critiquing both the president’s son and one of Fox News’s most prominent hosts.\nOn Wednesday it appeared that at least one part of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire was listening. The Northern Territory News – one of the company’s most rambunctious tabloids – ran a front-page editorial breaking with the party line of many other Murdoch outlets: “Now is not the time to play the blame game,” its front page declared. “Now is the time to discuss climate change.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Unless the world acts urgently to combat the climate crisis, it will be too late to do anything other than shuffle around the deckchairs on the Titanic.\nSo says the World Economic Forum, the body that organises the global elite’s annual shindig in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Each year the WEF asks experts what are likely to be the greatest threats over the next decade; this year, for the first time, the top five risks all related to the environment.\nLet’s park the cynicism for a minute. Yes, to be sure, there’s something nauseating about billionaires flying in from around the planet in their private jets to tell the rest of us we need to do more to reduce our carbon footprint. That said, the WEF report suggests it is a dangerous fallacy to assume that new ways of doing things can be phased in slowly over the next 20 or 30 years.\nThe incentives to put off action for another day are strong. Governments in democracies have regular elections to fight\nYet the political incentives to put off action for another day are strong. Governments in democracies have regular elections to fight, and they have seen what happened to Emmanuel Macron’s popularity after his attempt to raise fuel duty prompted the yellow vest protests.\nIn Britain there are pressures on ministers to agree measures to boost growth that would be counter-productive from a climate emergency perspective. The battle to save the airline Flybe from collapse and the looming decision over the high-speed rail line HS2 illustrate the dilemma for a government that claims to want to tackle climate change and Britain’s glaring regional economic imbalances.\nAdvertisement\nIf ministers had decided not to support Flybe earlier this week, Europe’s biggest regional airline would have seen planes grounded and 2,000 jobs put at risk. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has said he will consider scrapping air passenger duty (APT) on domestic flights as part of his March budget.\nWould tossing this particular lifeline to Flybe allow Boris Johnson to escape the charge that he is a southern toff who is not remotely serious about levelling up the regions? Yes, it would. Would it be consistent with the aim of tackling the climate emergency? Not remotely.\nThe best tax systems are those that penalise things a country wants less of while encouraging things it wants more of. Scrapping APT would do the opposite: indeed it would be both environmentally damaging and regressive, since it is the better-off – on average – who fly intercity in the UK.\nAPT is not the world’s best-designed green tax, but at least it recognises that there are hidden costs to air travel, and that those doing the polluting should pay. Scrapping the £13 charge on domestic flights would, according to the basic laws of economics, encourage more people to fly. On the other hand, allowing Flybe to go to the wall would hack off a lot of voters, many of whom have just broken the habit of a lifetime and voted Tory.\nHS2 will destroy or damage hundreds of UK wildlife sites, says report\nRead more\nOne alternative to flying is to take the train, yet the decision over whether to give approval to the high-speed link between London and the north of England presents another tough choice.\nUntil now, the case against HS2 has primarily been about its cost to the taxpayer, and there is certainly reason to be worried on this score: the costs have spiralled since it was first mooted. An initial £34bn price tag now stands at £88bn, according to the latest estimate. At the outset, taxpayers were supposed to get £2.30 back in economic benefits for every £1 spent. That is now down to between £1.30 and £1.50 for every pound invested, a figure that relies on no further cost rise and much higher train frequency than on other high-speed lines – both heroic assumptions.\nBut HS2 also has an environmental cost. A detailed report into its impact on wildlife says it will irreparably damage five internationally protected sites, almost 700 local wildlife sites, more than 100 ancient woodlands and 33 legally protected sites of special scientific interest. An HS2 spokesperson says the data is not new, and that the line will provide a cleaner and greener way to travel. But, increasingly, HS2 looks an enormously expensive way of adding some extra capacity to the rail network.\nCritics say there are less environmentally damaging and cheaper alternatives that would generate greater economic benefits to the UK in general and the regions in particular. They are right, and it is really quite scandalous that there has not been more careful consideration of whether the cash for the project (which will almost certainly end up costing more than £100bn) could be better spent. Ministers will probably give it the go-ahead anyway. Johnson has been something of an HS2 sceptic, but does he want his first big post-election domestic decision to be the abandonment of a project supported by Labour councils in the north, especially given that a third runway at Heathrow is going ahead? It would seem that, once again, infrastructure spending was being concentrated in the prosperous part of the country. The political optics would not be good.\nIn their different ways, the cases of Flybe and HS2 tell us much about modern Britain. When it comes to making decisions, the short term triumphs over the long term every time, especially when a powerful corporate lobby gets to work. Ministers say they see no contradiction between a growing economy and protecting the environment, and proudly boast that they are pledged to make Britain a net zero-carbon economy.\nBut that happy day is not planned to arrive until 2050. If the rest of the world follows Britain’s example, that will be a couple of decades too late.\n• Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

2017 has left Australia “not well positioned” to deal with fires, the “silent killer” of drought and other global heating impacts, its director has said.\nJean Palutikof, the director of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF), told Guardian Australia the decision to discontinue funding in 2017 – when Scott Morrison was treasurer – had hollowed out the research community and “the capacity to take action on climate change is smaller than it was decade ago”.\nScience can help us adapt to climate change, but first we have to admit it is happening\nRead more\nPalutikof made the comments as Scott Morrison and the science minister, Karen Andrews, attempt to shift debate from the link between climate change and bushfires to strategies for “adaptation and resilience”.\nThe research facility at Griffith University was a Howard government initiative, funded in the 2008 budget by the Rudd government and continued under the Abbott government with $9m over three years in the 2014 budget.\nAccording to the environment department, the body has produced 144 adaptation research projects since 2008 with a total of $56.3m in federal funding.\nBut in 2017, the Coalition gave the body just $600,000 to continue its existing online platforms that inform decision makers seeking to adapt to changes in climate, with no ongoing federal funding from 2018.\nPalutikof said the funding cut had forced it to axe conferences for researchers and community workshops informing business, local government and citizens about their exposure to climate risk.\nPalutikof warned that – although bushfire cooperative research centres have continued to receive funding – bushfire is “not the only risk”, citing drought and other natural disasters such as floods.\n“I worry if it starts to rain and bushfires cease to be an immediate risk some money will be pumped in and then we’ll forget about it,” she said. “The government will call it adaptation and resilience but people will be left in the same vulnerable state they were when these bushfires hit.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nA spokesman for environment minister Sussan Ley responded that the government is “investing heavily in climate adaptation and mitigation” and claimed investment is growing.\nHe cited a $23.9m commitment to the national environment sciences and climate change hub in science agency CSIRO, $37m for climate science monitoring and forecasting in CSIRO and $30m for the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence and Climate Extremes.\nEbony Bennett, the Australia Institute deputy director, said the decision to cut the NCCARF’s adaptation funding was “shortsighted” and “typical of the Coalition approach to climate policy”.\n“Any economist will tell you an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure,” she said. “The government’s new embrace of adaptation and resilience is welcome, but it’s the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff approach.\n“To reduce the amount of gas and coal mined and burned in Australia is the [better] response … to prevent hotter and drier summers in future.”\nLabor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said: “The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have cut funding for significant adaptation work at [science agency] CSIRO, completely de-funded the NCCARF and produced a national disaster risk reduction framework that failed to take climate change seriously.\n“The 2017 review of climate change policies completely excluded climate adaptation.”\nLabor’s criticism comes as the government held roundtables in Canberra to discuss the response to the bushfire crisis at which Ley met wildlife experts and Andrews met scientific organisations.\nSuzanne Milthorpe, national environment laws campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said the wildlife roundtable had seen “strong recognition that we can’t go back to business as usual”.\n“Australia was already the extinction nation, the bushfire crisis has exacerbated that severely,” she said. “We need not just to return to pre-bushfire levels but to aim for health and resilience and against further shock.\n“This is an unprecedented catastrophe – the first at this scale – but it won’t be the last.”\nAndrews said the science roundtable would discuss evidence about patterns of bushfire behaviour, contributors to the current fire season and tools to predict future seasons.\nButler said the meeting was “a start” but Labor “won’t hold our breath waiting for real action on climate adaptation or action”.\n'There is no link': the climate doubters within Scott Morrison's government\nRead more\nEarlier, Andrews told Nine Newspapers that “every second we spend discussing if climate change is real is a second we don’t spend addressing these issues”.\nAndrews issued a rebuke to many government MPs who continue to dispute the contribution of climate change to bushfires, such as George Christensen and Craig Kelly, warning it is time to “move on and get over this”.\nAt a press conference in Canberra announcing extra bushfire payments to families, Morrison said the hazards of “longer, hotter, drier summers” had “always been acknowledged by the government”.\nMorrison said that adaptation measures including hazard reduction, building dams and learning from Indigenous burning practices are “a part of that important response”.\n“Our policy is to reduce emissions, to build resilience and to focus on adaptation,” he said. “All of these are the necessary responses to what’s happening with our climate.

Asked on Wednesday about his message to backbenchers who continue to dispute the science, Morrison said “every member of parliament ... has a right to speak their mind”.\nHere’s what MPs have been saying.\nCraig Kelly\nA serial and constant denier of climate change, the New South Wales MP most recently made international headlines when he called a British meteorologist an “ignorant pommie weather girl” after openly denying the existence of climate change.\nPlay Video\n0:52\nPiers Morgan grills Craig Kelly for denying climate link to bushfires – video\nAdvertisement\n“Well firstly there is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment and on this our climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said that there is no link between drought and climate change.”\nKelly doubled down on his comments in an interview with Piers Morgan in the midst of the bushfire crisis.\nJust hours after Andrews’ comments, Kelly was back on Facebook denying Australia could do anything in terms of lowering emissions which “will have any measurable effect on global temperatures, sea levels or bad weather”.\nHe may have to limit his views to his social media though. Government MPs say Kelly has been encouraged to once again avoid interviews – he was previously stopped from appearing on the ABC’s Q&A program before the 2019 election campaign.\nGeorge Christensen\nAdvertisement\nThe Queensland MP continues to point to debunked and false theories that arson is to blame for the majority of blazes this summer.

The analyses reveal the scale of the climate crisis: both the past five years and the past decade are the hottest in 150 years.\nThe succession of records being broken year after year is “the drumbeat of the Anthropocene”, said one scientist, and is bringing increasingly severe storms, floods, droughts and wildfires.\nThe previous hottest year was in 2016, the year that a natural El Niño event boosted temperatures. The new data is for the average global surface air temperature. More than 90% of the heat trapped by human greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed by the oceans, but on Monday scientists revealed 2019 as the warmest yet recorded in the seas, calling it “dire news”.\nThe average temperature in 2019 was about 1.1C above the average from 1850-1900, before large-scale fossil fuel burning began. The world’s scientists have warned that global heating beyond 1.5C will significantly worsen extreme weather and suffering for hundreds of millions of people.\n2019 was Australia's hottest year on record – 1.5C above average temperature\nRead more\nThe World Economic Forum’s global risk assessment for the next decade, also published on Wednesday, found the top five dangers were all environmental, including extreme weather, failure to prepare for climate change and the destruction of the natural world.\nAdvertisement\n“The last decade was easily the warmest decade in the record and is the first decade more than 1C above late 19th-century temperatures,” said Gavin Schmidt, of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which produced one of the temperature records.\n“What is important is the totality of evidence from multiple independent data sets that the Earth is warming, that human activity is driving it and the impacts are clearly being felt,” he said. “These announcements might sound like a broken record, but what is being heard is the drumbeat of the Anthropocene.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Warming stripes’ represent annual temperatures from 1850 to 2019, with darker reds representing the warmest years. Photograph: Ed Hawkins\n“It’s now official that we have just completed the warmest decade on record, a reminder that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State University in the US.\nWhile instrumental temperature records stretch back to 1850, data from ice cores indicate that today’s temperatures were last seen at least 100,000 years ago. Furthermore, the level of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been for several million years, when the sea level was 15-20 metres higher.\nThe four temperature datasets are compiled from many millions of surface temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. They are produced by the UK Met Office with the University of East Anglia (UEA), both Nasa and Noaa in the US, and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Small differences between the analyses arise from how data-sparse polar regions are treated, but all agree that the past five years are the warmest five years since each global record began.\nAdvertisement\nThe Met Office’s forecast for global average temperature for 2020 suggests this year could well set another record and is very likely to be among the top three hottest. The UK government will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, and many others are urging nations to increase dramatically their pledges to cut carbon emissions, which would lead to global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“It is obvious we are not succeeding in preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, which was the main goal of the original 1992 UN climate change convention,” said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.\n“Even if we succeed in limiting warming to 1.5C, this would not be a ‘safe’ level of warming for the world,” he said. “Therefore we must focus on cutting global emissions to net zero as soon as possible. We know the transition to a net zero economy is the growth story of the 21st century.”\nRosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: “We’re breaking more records than Usain Bolt, but there are no gold medals for dangerous temperature rises, or the floods and fires that come with it.

The idea was outlined during the unveiling of a £2bn “transport vision” in Cardiff city centre on Wednesday.\nLeaders said the 10-year plan would help to tackle the climate emergency, reduce congestion and improve air quality. They claimed imposing a charge on motorists could lead to the same sea change that followed the introduction of charges for single-use plastic bags.\nDriving into a city should become as antisocial as smoking\nGaby Hinsliff\nRead more\nThe council leader, Labour’s Huw Thomas, said: “The future success of Cardiff hinges on getting transport right in the city. There can’t be anyone who is happy with the current state of affairs, which is why we are bringing forward this ambitious 10-year vision and why we are beginning an honest conversation about how it’s paid for.”\nAsked if a £2 charge was enough to change behaviour, Thomas said such a charge would break habits and generate significant funding for transport changes without penalising people too much. The council said it would not introduce charges before improvements had been made to public transport, and anticipated that there would be exemptions – for blue badge holders, for example.\nCaro Wild, the council’s cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said Stockholm had introduced a modestly priced congestion charge that had successfully changed behaviour.\nAdvertisement\nThe Labour councillor said: “Cardiff’s current transport network was designed half a century ago for a city of 200,000 people. Today, once commuters, shoppers and visitors are taken into account, our city has a daily population of almost half a million. No wonder our transport network is creaking – it’s no longer fit for purpose.\n“If you look at it from the point of view of the average Cardiff resident driving within the city to work every day, struggling for their bit of road space with the 80,000 other car commuters from outside the city’s boundaries, then absolutely, traffic congestion, traffic pollution and a public transport system which struggles to adequately serve the people who live and work here are all issues of major concern.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\n“We are living in a world where the climate emergency is changing how we feel about our future. I have become more and more convinced that to undertake the kind of radical change required we will need to investigate bringing in some form of charging mechanism to fund the infrastructure required in the city and the wider region.\n“One option might be a simple, universal, £2, low-charging system applied to non-Cardiff residents who drive into the city, which could reduce congestion while raising money towards paying for improvements to our transport network. We need to get people out of cars and on to public transport. To do that we need to give them the best public transport options. And to do that we need to raise money to pay for them.”\nWild said a congestion charge was not the only option and other possibilities would be looked at over the next year. He said: “No charge will be put in place until that business case is completed and all options have been reviewed.”\nThe white paper unveiled by the council lists a series of projects that could revolutionise public transport options in Cardiff and the region, including:\nOpening up new tram/train routes and stations.\nIntroducing new park-and-ride sites.\nLowering the cost of bus travel significantly.\nDelivering safer walking and cycling routes.\nAn electric bike pilot scheme.\nFiona Kinghorn, the executive director of public health for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: “We fully support the ambition to increase walking and cycling in Cardiff, provide major enhancements to the public transport network and reduce harmful air pollution.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

This is the year when world leaders must work with all sectors of society to repair and reinvigorate our systems of cooperation, not just for short-term benefit but for tackling our deep-rooted risks.”\nAfter a month in which bushfires have raged out of control in Australia, Brende said there was a need for urgent action.\n“We have only a very small window and if we don’t use that window in the next 10 years we will be moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.”\nThe WEF report said the retreat from the multilateral approach that helped cope with the 2008 financial crisis made it more difficult to tackle shared global risks.\nIt said the top five risks in terms of likelihood in the next 10 years were:\nExtreme weather events with major damage to property, infrastructure and loss of human life.\nFailure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation by governments and businesses.\nHuman-made environmental damage and disasters, including environmental crime, such as oil spills and radioactive contamination.\nMajor biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse with irreversible consequences for the environment, resulting in severely depleted resources for humankind as well as industries.\nMajor natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and geomagnetic storms.\nThe report was released ahead of the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos next week, which will be attended by the chief executives of some of the world’s biggest and powerful companies. Despite the large number of participants flying in to Switzerland by private jet, the WEF said Davos would be a carbon-neutral event.\nAdvertisement\nBut John Drzik, the chairman of Marsh & McLennan insights, which helped to compile the report, said businesses had to step up their action on global heating.\n“There is mounting pressure on companies from investors, regulators, customers, and employees to demonstrate their resilience to rising climate volatility. Scientific advances mean that climate risks can now be modelled with greater accuracy and incorporated into risk management and business plans.\nHigh-profile events, like recent bushfires in Australia and California, are adding pressure on companies to take action on climate risk at a time when they also face greater geopolitical and cyber risk challenges.”\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nPeter Giger, group chief risk officer of Zurich Insurance Group, which also collaborates in the preparation of the risks report, said there was a pressing need to adapt faster to avoid the worst and irreversible impacts of the climate crisis and to do more to protect the planet’s biodiversity.\n“Biologically diverse ecosystems capture vast amounts of carbon and provide massive economic benefits that are estimated at $33tn (£25tn) per year – the equivalent to the GDP of the US and China combined. It’s critical that companies and policymakers move faster to transition to a low carbon economy and more sustainable business models.\n“We are already seeing companies destroyed by failing to align their strategies to shifts in policy and customer preferences. Transitionary risks are real, and everyone must play their part to mitigate them.

On Tuesday, it looked like something might have changed.\nThe decision by BlackRock – the world’s biggest asset manager – to exit investments that “present a high sustainability-related risk” has been welcomed by environmentalists as a significant moment in the battle to reshape the relationship between money and the climate crisis.\nThe move is “a remarkable breakthrough”, the leading climate science writer Bill McKibben told the Guardian. “The activists who made this happen get the afternoon off to celebrate.\n“This is the biggest pot of money in the world and until today, its leaders have refused to acknowledge the biggest thing happening on the planet – the accelerating rise in temperature. So it indicates that the facts on the ground of the climate crisis are so grave that no one can turn away, and that activist pressure has reached a point that even the richest companies are not immune.”\nIn two letters on Monday, the BlackRock boss, Larry Fink, announced: “The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance” and henceforth the company would divest $500m from coal-related businesses.\nThe announcement called on “every company, not just energy firms, to rethink their carbon footprints”.\nBlackRock, which holds $7tn in assets, has come under intense pressure to reform the funds it offers investors.\n“Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,” Fink wrote, adding that new funds would allow clients to avoid investments in companies that may be adding to climate change.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe firm said it doubled to 150 the number of exchange-traded funds it offers that address social, environmental or governance issues.\nIn November, climate activists protested outside BlackRock’s London offices, dumping ashes to signify the Amazon fires while Extinction Rebellion, the global environmental movement, described BlackRock as the world’s top investor in deforestation and coal. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging action, while BlackRock was named as an investor with one of the worst voting records on climate issues by Ceres, a not-for-profit watchdog that pushes financial firms to consider sustainability.\nThe pressure for change has come from within the world of finance as well as outside. Last month, Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England, warned that pension funds risk seeing their assets become worthless unless companies rapidly rise to the challenge of the climate crisis.\nAdvertisement\nBut while some celebrated, others warned that sustainable investing will not be quick or simple for BlackRock. It currently holds a 6.7% stake in ExxonMobil, 6.9% in Chevron, and 6% in the mining company Glencore. Two-thirds of its $7tn in assets are in tracking funds that cannot easily be switched to meet sustainability goals.\nBlackRock now needs to use its voting clout to fuel sustainable investing\nNils Pratley\nRead more\nMcKibben, who last year published a devastating report in the New Yorker titled Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warming Burns and who is part of a campaign to force companies including Goldman Sachs, Chase Bank and BlackRock to reform their investments, said environmentalists would now need to keep the pressure up.\n“The steps BlackRock is taking are baby steps, and we will have to watch and push hard for them to begin striding at the pace we need to go. But in some sense, the first step is often the hardest,” McKibben said.\nHe urged the company to go further. Its decision to divest $500m from coal-related businesses, for instance, is not the same as divesting from larger and far more polluting oil and gas industries.\n“Coal is part of the problem, but not the biggest part of the problem – oil and gas are,” McKibben said. “Fink made noises that natural gas is part of the solution but it’s not. That’s old thinking, and we’ll push them hard on that, but at least we’ve reached the point that they’ve realized they have a role in dealing with the climate crisis.”\nBut perhaps the largest change is BlackRock’s apparent willingness to use its considerable shareholder power to demand climate action – a power it has in the past demurred from using in favor of direct company consultations.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBlackRock’s chairman and CEO, Larry Fink. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP\nA report last year by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project claimed that BlackRock had voted overwhelmingly against key climate resolutions at energy companies, including ExxonMobil.\nAdvertisement\nHad BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claimed.\n“We have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,” BlackRock said in a statement to the Guardian at the time. But, it warned, “it would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal’s impact”.\nIn Tuesday’s statement, that position appeared to be shifting from last year when it said that “recent extreme weather events” and “the implications for investment portfolios – stemming from a rising frequency and intensity of such events – have been notoriously hard for investors to grasp”.\nNo longer. Now BlackRock’s CEO writes that company directors should be held accountable “where we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues”. He added that “the company voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies” last year.\nThere are still worries for environmentalists. Majority Action’s Eli Kasargod-Staub warned that subtlety in BlackRock’s language calling for companies to improve disclosure on “integrating and reporting on sustainability” is not the same as calling for immediate action.\n“BlackRock has the power to be going to corporate directors and saying: ‘Either you commit to the science-based targets of the Paris climate agreement and align your operations, governance, political spending, lobby and trade association activities to achieve that target or we will vote against you and your directors,’” Kasargod-Staub said.\n“But that’s not what BlackRock said – they said they’re calling on companies to enhance their disclosures around climate risks and their plans around those risks,” he added.\nKasargod-Staub pointed to this quote from BlackRock, directed at companies it invests in: “This should include your plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD [Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures] guidelines.”\n“Think about how passive that sentence is, then think about the behavior of ExxonMobil or Marathon petroleum, who through their capital expenditures and policy influence have actively undermined our ability to protect long-term investors and meet the goals of the Paris agreement,” said Kasargod-Staub.\nAdvertisement\nWhether Blackrock is now going to side with activist resolutions on sustainability remains to be seen during shareholder season, McKibben said, but he warned against expecting a shift by fossil-fuel energy producers to become carbon-neutral.\n“I don’t think the big oil companies are capable of changing, though I’d like to be proved wrong,” he said. “The job is basically to starve them and reduce their ability to continue expanding.”\nStill, McKibben said: “For all of us that have been campaigning for years around climate finances, this is an historic moment. From today, it’s going to be harder to go sink of load of money in Exxon, because the biggest financial firm in the world has said, ‘Huh, there’s something to this climate stuff. Better pay attention.’”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Murdoch's attack on News Corp and Fox News 'not discussed by board'","paragraph":"The lead independent director of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, Peter Barnes, says the media group’s board has yet to discuss James Murdoch’s attack on the company over its stance on the climate crisis.\nOn Wednesday James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s son and a News Corp director, issued a joint statement with his wife, Kathryn Murdoch, in which the couple said they were frustrated by coverage of the climate crisis by Fox News and News Corp.\n“They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary,” a spokesperson for the couple said.\nThe Australian says it accepts climate science, so why does it give a platform to 'outright falsehoods'?\nRead more\nJames Murdoch’s intervention – a rare attack by a company director on his own group’s operations – added fuel to an already raging debate in Australia over News Corp’s coverage of global heating and the deadly bushfires that have devastated the country’s eastern seaboard.\nShareholder activists said the move added to the pressure on News Corp over the climate emergency and could lead to investor attacks on management at the company’s annual meeting later this year.\nAdvertisement\nIt also appears to reignite a succession battle between James Murdoch and his brother, Lachlan, that seemed resolved in 2018 when Lachlan was given important executive positions within the family empire as part of a restructure of the group.\nNews Corp itself battened down the hatches on Wednesday, with management in Sydney and New York declining to comment on the Murdoch scion’s comments.\nThe atmosphere inside the company’s Australian headquarters on Holt Street in Sydney was guarded on Wednesday as staff grappled with the unexpected attack, News Corp sources said.\nHowever, Barnes, a former executive with tobacco company Philip Morris who now serves as the lead independent director on News Corp’s board, told the Guardian he was aware of media reports of James Murdoch’s statement.\nSign up to the Media Briefing: news for the news-makers\nRead more\nAs lead director, Barnes has an important role on the News Corp board that includes acting as a conduit between News Corp and investors, helping to set the pay of executives and acting as chair of the audit committee.\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon, Australian time, he said he had no comment on James Murdoch’s statement.\n“What I’ve read in the papers is breaking news and we don’t meet again until the middle of February,” he said. “As you would no doubt know, this board has quite a lot of international people.”\nIn addition to James Murdoch, his brother, Lachlan Murdoch, and father, Rupert Murdoch, who is executive chairman, News Corp’s board includes the former president of Spain, José María Aznar, Ana Paula Pessoa, who is a director of Brazilian artificial intelligence company Kunumi, and former US senator Kelly Ayotte.\n“I understand from the papers that James has made a statement but I have no comment to make because I haven’t made contact with them [the other directors],” Barnes said.\nBrynn O’Brien, who heads the the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the shareholder activist group currently held no shares in News Corp.\n“The pressure’s mounting on them on climate change, so let’s see,” she said. “It’s a very unusual situation where you have a board member on the record, through a spokesperson, attacking the governance and operations of the company.”\nShareholder activist Stephen Mayne, a former News Corp journalist who has repeatedly attacked the company over issues including a two-class share structure that cements the control of the Murdoch family, said an “obvious next step” would be to put up a resolution on climate change at the next AGM, which is likely to be held in October or November.\n“I certainly think there’s a big opportunity for the full symphony of shareholder resolutions and engagement,” he said.\nSpokesmen for News Corp in Sydney and New York declined to comment on James Murdoch’s comments.\nThe Sydney representative said the company stood by comments made by News Corp Australia chairman, Michael Miller, on Friday in response to a leaked email to him in which an employee accused News Corp papers, including the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun, of spreading misinformation by focusing on arson as the cause of the bushfires, rather than climate change.\nMiller said News Corp “does not deny climate change or the gravity of its threat”.\n“Our coverage has recognised that Australia is having a serious conversation about climate change and how to respond to it,” he said. “However, it has also reflected there are a variety of views and opinions about the current fire crisis. The role of arsonists and policies that may have contributed to the spread of fire are, therefore, legitimate stories to report in the public interest.”\nEven this week Telegraph columnists were still blogging about the “woke greenies” who were responsible for the fires and “the distorted debate.”\nIn his Monday Daily Telegraph blog, Tim Blair quoted Breitbart columnist James Delingpole: “Where this Australian bushfire tragedy is concerned, no one deserves more opprobrium than the greens whose poisonous, anti-human, anti-science, anti-history ideology has turned what could have been a minor inconvenience into a full-on disaster.”\nHe went on to link to Delingpole’s column, whose central thesis was that the fires had nothing to do with climate change.\n“The dry, hot conditions which have exacerbated these fires are weather, not climate,” he writes. “Australia, a hot, dry country, has been here many, many times before.”\nJames Murdoch criticises father's news outlets for climate crisis denial\nRead more\nOn Wednesday, columnist Miranda Devine stridently counselled Scott Morrison to resist a royal commission into the bushfires, arguing that “global forces are using Australia’s fires as propaganda to drum up support for their climate agenda”.\nMeasured by loss of life, Devine argues the 2009 Victorian fires were a far bigger tragedy. Victoria had a royal commission into those fires.\n“Even if you accept the proposition that humans can dial down the earth’s temperature by not using fossil fuels or eating meat, Australia creates a puny 1.3% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions,” she argued. “Morrison could capitulate to the carbonistas, and close down Australia, but it won’t stop the bushfires.\n“Blaming climate change is a cynical diversion from the criminal negligence of governments which have tried to buy green votes by locking up vast tracts of land as national parks yet failed to spend the money to control ground fuel and maintain fire trails.”\nA 2013 study of News Corp’s coverage of climate change found almost half its comment pieces expressed doubt about climate science. It has continued to publish climate deniers whose columns have been comprehensively debunked by scientists.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The new government has championed its commitment to climate action. It now needs to set out its policy on fossil fuel extraction, making clear that digging more coal out of the ground is no longer acceptable,” Willis said.\nRecommendations made in the report include using less steel, using recycled steel, improving the efficiency of steel production with conventional blast furnaces, and producing steel with new processes such as renewable energy.\nDustin Benton, Green Alliance’s policy director, said: “Clean energy has already made coal obsolete in the power sector. Our previous work shows that UK demand for coking coal would halve if steel producers opted for cheaper, cleaner steel production using today’s technologies.\n“In addition, innovation in zero carbon steel production means this mine will likely become redundant in the near future, saddling Cumbria with an expensive stranded asset.”\nCouncillors who backed proposals for the undersea mine said it would create vital jobs. It is expected to employ 500 people, with an estimated 2,000 more jobs created in its supply chain.\nBut Berners-Lee, a leading expert in carbon footprinting and the brother of internet pioneer Sir Tim, said the emphasis should be on creating green jobs.\n“Cumbria’s politicians understandably want to see new jobs on the west coast. But we estimate that the profits from the mine would leave the local area, with only 3% of the turnover spent on salaries,” he said.\n“We urgently need an active, low-carbon industrial strategy for Cumbria and other local areas, to generate thousands of green jobs rather than hundreds of coal jobs.”\nThe developer West Cumbria Mining has previously revealed that it agreed a deal for a 50MW solar farm nearby to provide about a third of the project’s energy needs, in order to mitigate some of the impact of the plant on the environment.\nIn June, the UK became the first large economy to pass laws to end its contribution to global warming by 2050. The goal requires Britain to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, compared with the previous target of at least 80% reduction from 1990 levels.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We are well on the way to phasing coal out of our energy system by 2025 and last year Great Britain went nearly 4,000 hours without using coal for electricity. Ending our use of it will be a key milestone on our journey to end our contribution to climate change entirely.\n“Although coal will soon no longer be part of our energy system, there will continue to be domestic demand for coal in industries such as steel, cement and even heritage railways.”\nWest Cumbria Mining said it did not want to comment on the report.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Some of the turtles were found to have swum as far as Nova Scotia in north-east Canada and to France to find new feeding grounds for the jellyfish which form their main diet.\nAdvertisement\nThough small in scale, the research provides an insight into how some marine species are being forced to adapt to the warming oceans. This week scientists warned that ocean temperatures had reached record levels with the last five years, which were the five hottest on record.\nWarming oceans pose clear dangers to human life as they lead to more intense storms and rising sea levels, but the impact of the increasing frequency of heatwaves at sea on marine species is much less studied. There is evidence that some species, including commercially important fish such as cod, are migrating towards the poles in search of cooler waters, but more research is needed for a fuller picture.\nIn another stark example of the dangers to marine life from human actions, one turtle followed was found dead on a beach in Suriname only 120km (74 miles) from the starting point, drowned after having become enmeshed in a discarded fishing net.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nEstimates say more than half of all sea turtles have ingested plastic. The animals also face threats from overfishing, though they are mainly bycatch rather than targets.\nThe beaches of French Guiana were once abundant turtle nesting grounds, but now the eggs laid there are only a small fraction of those laid 30 years ago.\nLast year, the complete absence of leatherback turtles from a beach in a nature reserve in Nicaragua also raised alarm.\n“Sea turtles survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, but they might not survive us,” said Will McCallum, a campaigner at Greenpeace. “Human activity has put such severe pressure on sea turtle populations around the world that six out of the seven species are threatened with extinction. Without urgent action the situation will only get worse.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Activists were banging on BlackRock’s door. Fink’s treaties on the importance of companies having a “purpose” had become tired. Even some clients were saying BlackRock’s claim to be “engaging” on climate issues was feeble.\nSo let’s not imagine that the world’s largest asset manager, with almost $7tn under its roof, has suddenly become a pace-setter. In the eyes of many big European fund management houses, most of Fink’s declarations on Tuesday will have sounded wholly conventional. Viewing climate change as “a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects”, as he put it in his “dear CEO” letter, is a mainstream position.\nEqually, though, let’s not be too churlish. BlackRock made some solid commitments. In its actively-managed portfolios, it will ditch companies that derive a quarter or more of their revenues from thermal coal, one of the most polluting energy sources. It will launch new investment products that screen for fossil fuels, thereby giving loyal clients more scope to move their money.\nFlybe saved after ministers and investors seal rescue deal\nRead more\nBlackRock will also push companies to disclose their climate risks according to widely accepted standards. It has joined the influential Climate Action 100+ group of investors, which closest rival Vanguard refuses to do. It now believes sustainable investing is “the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward,” which is a critical statement from a fund manager with a fiduciary duty to aim to generate good returns for investors.\nNone of the above, however, alters the fact that BlackRock will remain the largest investor in some of the word’s biggest corporate polluters. The firm runs 70% of its money passively, meaning it owns every stock in a specified index. On that front, what matters is BlackRock’s willingness to throw its weight around and deploy its enormous voting muscle against foot-dragging managements.\nAdvertisement\nVoting, however, was the area where Fink’s letter was vaguest. BlackRock has attracted a pile of criticism for its pusillanimous record on climate resolutions but the new approach merely said the firm will be “increasingly disposed” to vote against uncooperative boards. What does that mean? Fink would seem to have granted his fund managers an awful lot of wriggle-room.\nTherein lies the continuing frustration. It is clearly good news that Fink is talking about “a fundamental reshaping of finance”; that will make it easier for trustees to win internal battles over investment polices. But the missing ingredient is a sense that BlackRock is willing to use its voting clout to upset powerful interests. Fink can allay that doubt by action – but “increasingly disposed” does not sound like a battle cry.\nFlybe’s rescue deal needs to be transparent\nBusiness Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news\nRead more\nFlybe is saved – sort of. Actually, it’s hard to tell from Tuesday’s late announcement whether the troubled airline secured a meaningful handout from the Treasury. A government promise to review air passenger duty “to ensure regional connectivity” is not the same as a firm commitment.\nFlybe’s controlling consortium, led by Virgin Atlantic, seems to have heard enough to stick some more cash into the business to keep flying for now. The quantity was not specified but a willingness to invest was a minimum requirement to be taken seriously. Virgin & co bought Flybe less than a year ago, so it’s a bit soon for buyer’s remorse.\nThe government needs to tread carefully. Yes, regional connectivity is important, so there’s a case for subsidising vital routes if absolutely necessary, as happens on the London-Newquay route. But scrapping passenger duty to save Flybe itself would be absurd. And if, in fact, Flybe is receiving a state loan or tax deferral, the terms need to be transparent.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nAnother embarrassment for M&S\nCredit rating agencies do not have a monopoly of wisdom, as we discovered in the banking crisis when they awarded top scores to mortgage-backed derivatives in the US that turned out to be toxic. All the same, Moody’s threat to downgrade the debt of Marks & Spencer to junk status is embarrassing for the retailer.\nAdvertisement\nRemember it was only a year ago that M&S cut its dividend to save money and raised £600m from shareholders via a rights issue. The latter helped financed the purchase of a 50% stake in half of Ocado’s UK business, so the cash went out of the door. All the same, the deal was meant to improve M&S’s long-term earnings potential, and thus its ability to service debt.\nJunk status in the eyes of a grownup rating agency would be another milestone in a long decline – and, actually, more significant than being overtaken by Boohoo in stock market capitalisation.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Citizens’ assemblies are increasingly used around the world to build consensus. In Ireland, they helped pave the way for the historic changes on abortion, while in Poland they improved government response to major flooding. It’s time we used them here,” she said.\nCitizens’ assemblies see ordinary members of the public confront social or political challenges politicians have been unable to resolve. Facilitated by experts, and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, they are aimed at removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.\nAs well as calling for the wider use of citizens’ assemblies, Phillips adopts some of the proposals for political reform advocated by Clive Lewis, the leftwing Norwich South MP who dropped out of the leadership race on Monday after failing to secure adequate support from MPs.\nShe said the electoral system should be changed – “so that parliament better reflects votes cast” – and the House of Lords reformed.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nHer other proposals include devolution to local authorities; automatic voter enrolment; and creating a new watchdog to regulate online political advertising, funded by an advertising levy.\n“If people are to trust our electoral process, we urgently need to combat fake news during campaigns.

In the House of Commons on 9 January, Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister Heather Wheeler answered a question about the Australian bushfires by stating: “Very regrettably, it is widely reported on social media that 75% of the fires were started by arsonists.”\nThe claim that arson is a primary cause of this season’s bushfires has been comprehensively debunked: fire officers report that the majority of blazes were started by dry lightning storms. Nevertheless, social media is awash with false claims about the role of arson, obscuring the link between climate change and bushfires (Disinformation and lies are spreading faster than Australia’s bushfires, 11 January).\nHowever fires start, they burn more severely because Australia is suffering extreme conditions which are directly linked to anthropogenic climate change: 2019 was the country’s hottest and driest year ever, with the temperature 1.5C above the long-term average. The Australian government was advised in 2008 that the effects of climate change on the fire seasons “should be directly observable by 2020”.\nWe ask that ministers rely on expert advice rather than social media. Beyond the present situation in Australia, it is important to acknowledge the role of climate change in many other circumstances worldwide, including in the UK.\nAs host of this year’s UN climate talks, the UK government is responsible for keeping the Paris agreement on track.

But this would amount to a massive handout to the country’s dirtiest form of transport. Encouraging the expansion of aviation is a dangerous and irresponsible move at a time when there is more and more evidence of the damage that the climate crisis is already causing.\nThis is also a terrible way to determine policy. The government is making decisions about the whole industry on the basis of one failing airline. It looks suspiciously like ministers are considering using the failure of Flybe as an excuse to deliver on a dubious manifesto commitment to “improve regional connectivity”.\nConveniently enough, the government is claiming its options are limited by EU state aid rules, which mean all domestic flights must be considered together. But that is simply false: routes that are considered socially necessary can be exempt from the rules. Flybe already receives tax relief on its Newquay to Heathrow route, which is classified as a public service obligation (PSO) link. Likewise, for similar reasons, ferries to the Scottish islands also fall outside the state aid rules.\nThe UK is the last place on Earth that should be encouraging people to fly. More Britons travelled abroad in 2018 than any other nationality. Roughly one in 12 of all international travellers in 2018 were British, a staggering 126.2 million UK passengers.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\n‘Roughly one in 12 of all international travellers in 2018 were British, a staggering 126.2 million UK passengers.’ Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters\nThen there are all the flights we take within the country: 38% of Flybe’s flights are domestic. These are short journeys that could easily be substituted with rail trips. Exeter to London now takes just over two hours by train compared to one hour 10 minutes by plane. However, a true comparison must take into account the extra time required to travel to and from the airport and to check in.\nShort-haul flights have a disproportionately large carbon footprint, with an average 65kg per person by plane compared to just over 11kg by train. Yet the aviation industry still receives an annual subsidy through an exemption from tax on aviation fuel and VAT on tickets. So rather than using subsidies to artificially prop up a business that is financially and environmentally unsustainable, the government should transfer those subsidies to rail travel. That would increase and improve regional and local rail networks, and reduce fares. A frequent flyer levy would generate additional revenue to fund rail and other sustainable transport solutions, while encouraging a shift away from flying.\nWe need to follow the lead taken by others in Europe. In Sweden, the number of passengers on domestic flights fell 9% last year, largely as a result of a home-grown “flight shame” movement. Meanwhile, the Greens in Germany have pledged to ban domestic flights in the next 15 years if they enter a coalition government, a not unlikely scenario in the near future.\nGuardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you\nRead more\nOf course the colossal size of the aviation industry in the UK means there are thousands of jobs dependent on it. This helps to explain why governments have consistently been reluctant to challenge it. Redundancy is always a painful process, but the reality is that many jobs in aviation and other fossil fuel-based industries simply aren’t sustainable. This is why we urgently need an industrial policy based around the Green New Deal to train and reskill workers so they can transition to the environmentally and socially beneficial jobs of the future.\nIt is also clear that such a transition will generate more and better jobs. In this case, increasing the cost of flights will also provide a boost to domestic jobs in tourism, as millions more people would spend their weekends and short breaks in the UK rather than in far-flung destinations.\nThe government shouldn’t be throwing a lifeline to Flybe or encouraging the domestic aviation industry through tax cuts. On the contrary: we need to use all the instruments at our disposal to radically slash the number of domestic flights and invest in a local and regional transport revolution. We must ensure that the cheapest and most convenient transport option is always the sustainable one.\n• Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England and Gibraltar.

We think they’re going to lose us money, not make us money.”\nBracks said: “All the companies we invest in understand they have to have a long-term sustainable future and they have to assess the risk of climate change within that.\n“They know that there will be some stranded assets – particularly in energy generation – if we don’t get the right economic settings for investment in generation in the future, and so they’re really taking the lead and doing the work that the government should be doing.”\nAs well as pushing corporate Australia to take environmental, social and governance issues more seriously, including by serving as a member of a string of investor groups, Atkin also piloted Cbus through two royal commissions.\nNot-for-profit superannuation funds surge into top spot after banking inquiry\nRead more\nThe trade union royal commission, set up by the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, after the 2013 election criticised Cbus and Atkin over the leak of personal information about fund members to the construction union – before itself giving confidential Cbus documents to other parties.\nBut Cbus skated through 2018’s banking royal commission after counsel assisting, Michael Hodge, QC, decided not to call any witnesses from the fund.\nAdvertisement\nInstead Hodge and the commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, held hearings that demolished the reputations of the for-profit sector – an outcome that embarrassed the government, which had included superannuation in the inquiry’s terms of reference in a bid to embarrass industry funds over their links to the unions.\n“We were to be called and they did not call us in the end and they were quite satisfied with the procedures we had in place, and that’s a good thing,” Bracks said.\n“So we take that as a seal of approval, but more than that the royal commission as it turns out was a great boon for industry funds, and certainly in our fund we had something like $1bn of net inflows extra compared to the previous year over the period of the royal commission.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The fire was the result of a fuel reduction burn, which escaped 10 days after it was lit when the weather became hot and windy. I remember it well as I was Victoria’s environment minister at the time, responsible for the park and the burn.\nThe then premier Steve Bracks was one of the campers evacuated.\nIn 2015 a fuel reduction burn at Lancefield in Victoria escaped, causing a fire that destroyed six homes and caused a great deal of anguish for the local community. There have been many such instances of fuel reduction burns escaping and causing damage in different parts of Australia. The risk of putting fire in the landscape for fuel reduction is real.\nExplainer: how effective is bushfire hazard reduction on Australia's fires?\nRead more\nFor years, elements of the media have promoted the idea that “greenies” and environmentalists have prevented fuel reduction burning. This particularly suits those with an agenda to deny climate change as it simultaneously advances the culture war against environmentalists and draws attention away from the need to take action on climate change. As environment minister, I don’t recall ever being influenced or lobbied by environmentalists or “greens” to stop fuel reduction burns.\nWhat does stand in the way of planned burns is climate change: higher temperatures, dryer fuel and strong winds in autumn and spring making it unsafe to burn. A shorter timeframe for safe burning – not “debate by environmentalists” – is the overwhelming factor.\nMuch attention has been given to the recommendation of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission to implement a program of planned burning based on an annual target of 5% of public land – 390,000 hectares for Victoria. The former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett and others have criticised the Victorian government for not achieving this target.\nHowever, these criticisms not only ignore the climate-related difficulties with planned burning, they also fail to take account of the expert advice received in the years since the royal commission reported.\nThe weather-related difficulties in achieving a hectare-based target were born out in 2014, the last year of the Napthine Coalition government, when only 82,022 hectares were burnt despite the government’s commitment to the 5% target. Kennett’s government itself could manage only 40,000 hectares of planned burning in 1997-98 and I had the same experience myself when I was minister in the very dry and hot 2006 year.\nThe royal commission itself acknowledged that planned burning is risky and only available in limited timeframes. The royal commission also recommended that the Victorian government appoint an independent person to monitor the implementation of its recommendations. The former police chief commissioner Neil Comrie was appointed to the role and in his reports in 2012 and 2013 recommended that the planned burning target of 5% be replaced. Comrie concluded that the 5% was not “achievable, affordable or sustainable” and recommended that it be replaced by a risk-based approach with a primary focus on human life and safety.\nDisinformation and lies are spreading faster than Australia's bushfires\nRead more\nFollowing Comrie’s reports, the Inspector General of Emergency Management recommended a change from a hectare-based target for planned burns to a risk reduction target. A group of fire experts from around the country reviewed this recommendation and backed the changed approach because it focuses on the areas of highest risk rather than on burning broad acres for the sake of meeting a target. The risk-based approach also creates incentives to pursue alternative forms of risk reduction such as mowing and slashing when planned burning is not possible.\nIn 2016, the Victorian government agreed to adopt this new approach, which means that fuel reduction is now done in a way to maximise the reduction in risk to people and their homes rather than simply burning as many hectares as possible. Fuel reduction burns are now carefully planned using computer-based fire models that indicate where the burning is likely to be most effective. The target is to reduce the risk that homes will be lost by 30%, which experts advised is the right level across the state.\nPlanned burns cannot guarantee that homes will be saved. They are most effective when the fire is at ground level, but they are of limited effect on the most dangerous fire weather days when a fire can race across tree crowns or across already burnt areas.\nAdvertisement\nFuel reduction burns should be part of the toolkit that our firefighting agencies have to tackle the ever-growing risk of bushfire. They should not be used as a weapon in the culture wars in order to divert attention from the need to act on climate change.\nJohn Thwaites is the chair of Monash Sustainable Development Institute and ClimateWorks Australia and a former deputy premier and environment minister in Victoria\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Second, we host debates reflecting the political division that exists in Australia about how to address climate change without destroying our economy.”\nIt said its coverage of the bushfires had been “wilfully and ineptly misrepresented by the New York Times and Guardian Australia as climate denial”.\nJames Murdoch criticises father's news outlets for climate crisis denial\nRead more\nThe Australian newspaper’s editorials, like its news stories, accept the basic premise that humans cause climate change and that action should be taken. The newspaper also covers diligently the news around the climate policy debate and the implications of climate change for business.\nBut its defence of its bushfire coverage ignores its prolonged willingness to expose readers to a regular diet of misrepresentations on climate change science on its opinion page, as well as outright denial of the breadth of science linking fossil fuel burning to dangerous climate change.\nIn November, as the bushfire crisis was unfolding, News Corp’s executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, told his annual general meeting: “There are no climate change deniers around, I can assure you.”\nThe next day the Australian ran a column from the mining industry figure and geologist Prof Ian Plimer, who wrote: “It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.”\nThe organisation Climate Feedback asks climate scientists to fact-check articles and opinion columns.\nLike three previous Plimer columns, the group gave the article its lowest rank for scientific credibility, saying it was “a mixture of misdirection, misleading claims and outright falsehoods”.\nLast month, two days after the Bureau of Meteorology declared that 17 December 2019 had been Australia’s hottest day on record, the Australian published a story quoting a long-time critic and climate science “sceptic” questioning the bureau’s methodology.\nThe story quoted “climate scientist” Dr Jennifer Marohasy but did not mention that Marohasy works at the Institute of Public Affairs, a Melbourne thinktank heavily financed by the mining billionaire Gina Rinehart and known for promoting climate science denial.\nThe story reported Marohasy’s criticisms of a widely used technique known as homogenisation that corrects for known errors in data, even though the data used to calculate the hottest day record is not homogenised.\nThe Australian has a long history in this space.\nIn 2009 it published a column that dismissed climate science as a “fraud” pushed by “warmaholics”.\nExplainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?\nRead more\nIn response, an exasperated Dr Michael Coughlan, then chief climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said: “The Australian clearly has an editorial policy.\n“No matter how many times the scientific community refutes these arguments, they persist in putting them out – to the point where we believe there’s little to be gained in the use of our time in responding.”\nIn 2013 a study of News Corp’s coverage of climate change found it was a dominant voice in the country’s media on the subject. The Australian wrote more on it than any other outlet, and almost half its comment pieces expressed doubt about the science, including 100% of seven editorials analysed. Only 18% of news stories expressed doubt, the study said.\nIn 2013 the newspaper ran a front page story with the headline “Sea rise ‘not linked to warming’ ”, based on a study which it later admitted it had “misinterpreted”.\nThe same year it ran a news story claiming that “experts” were worried about a coming ice age. The article relied on five-year-old quotes lifted from a blog by a group that has claimed carbon dioxide is a “coolant” and not a greenhouse gas.\nThe Australian has also published stories sympathetic to claims that wind turbines make people sick.\nIn 2012 the Australian Press Council upheld a complaint against the newspaper after it ran an article by a British climate science denier, James Delingpole, in which he quoted an anonymous sheep farmer who had compared the wind energy industry to a paedophile ring.\nAfter the press council’s judgment, Delingpole returned in the Australian to say he stood by “every word” of his story “especially the bit about paedophiles”.\nAustralia is built on lies, so why would we be surprised about lies about climate change?\nLuke Pearson for IndigenousX\nRead more\nOne of the Australian’s most flagrant and regular deniers has been Maurice Newman, the former ABC chairman and adviser to Tony Abbott who believes climate scientists are part of a global socialist plot.\n“The scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,” Newman has written.\nOn checking one column, a scientist Newman had quoted to back his argument that global cooling was on the way said the claims were “scientifically ludicrous”. As recently as last week Newman referred to “the media left, Hollywood and the rest of the global warming cult”, comparing them to “ancient druids”.\nEven while covering the topic of hazard reduction, the Australian has turned to climate science deniers.\nOn New Year’s Eve it ran an opinion column by Viv Forbes that advocated a revival of traditional fire management techniques, while blaming the intensity of the fires on a lack of hazard reduction and the creation of national parks.\nAdvertisement\nThe column did not mention climate change.\nForbes spent more than 40 years in the coal industry – a connection not disclosed in the column – and leads a project against the Paris climate agreement that says fossil fuel emissions are not changing the climate, and that increasing concentrations of CO2 are “improving the environment, not harming it”.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

In his 2019 annual letter, Fink said his overriding duty was to make customers money.\nBlackRock identifies several new measures in its investment approach, such as lowering its exposure to fossil fuel companies, which has been a major demand by environmental protesters.\nThese include: “Making sustainability integral to portfolio construction and risk management; exiting investments that present a high sustainability-related risk, such as thermal coal producers; launching new investment products that screen fossil fuels; and strengthening our commitment to sustainability and transparency in our investment stewardship activities.”\nThe company said it intended to play an active role in solving the climate crisis: “BlackRock does not see itself as a passive observer in the low-carbon transition. We believe we have a significant responsibility – as a provider of index funds, as a fiduciary, and as a member of society – to play a constructive role in the transition.”\nSome analysts have pointed out that the majority of BlackRock’s investments sit in index funds which broadly follow the stock market, and which it can only influence by putting pressure on firms to act more sustainably.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\nFink’s announcement was welcomed by groups critical of BlackRock’s environmental credentials. “Putting climate change at the absolute centre of its business is the way every company should respond to this planetary emergency,” said Diana Best, of the Sunrise Project, which supports groups campaigning against the climate crisis.\n“BlackRock beginning its shift of capital out of fossil fuels, including today’s divestment of coal in its actively managed funds, is a fantastic start and instantly raises the bar for competitors such as Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors. Even with today’s announcements, based on its size BlackRock will still remain one of, if not the largest, investors in fossil fuels. So we will be looking for additional leadership from the company.”\nFink’s letter comes just days after the firm joined Climate Action 100+, an influential pressure group of large asset managers, which is calling for the biggest polluters to reduce their emissions to respond to the climate crisis.

A train ticket for the same journey would cost £141.\nThis kind of price disparity between domestic flights and rail journeys has been the norm for years, the result of under-investment in railways and rail fares allowed to rise at rates much higher than inflation, while regional airports and airlines receive publicly funded incentives and tax breaks on fuel. It comes despite the government’s much-vaunted green policies, and its repeated goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\nGiven these price differences, and the woeful state of many of the UK’s railways, it is easy to see why the UK’s aviation sector is set to become the country’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, if left unchecked. That would blow apart the country’s carbon budgets and the net zero commitment.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe Committee on Climate Change, writing to the government last year, warned: “Plausible options for how aviation could become zero carbon, even by mid-century, are lacking. Given a population that is anticipated to grow and rising incomes, some growth in [aviation] demand is expected. However, this cannot be unfettered.”\nIf the government presses ahead with plans to cut air passenger duty from domestic flights, as it is proposing in attempts to ensure the survival of Flybe, that would also send the wrong signal to the markets, argues Sam Fankhauser, director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “Air passenger duty is applied as a green tax, based broadly on the principle that the polluter pays. Cutting or removing [it] would essentially reduce or eliminate the carbon price for flying.”\nAir travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector'\nLeo Murray\nAs price comparisons show, air passenger duty at its current rate is at nowhere near the price that would be needed to tip the economic balance away from air travel. Indeed, according to the veteran flying campaigner Leo Murray, director of innovation at the climate charity Possible, that was never the intention.\n“It was designed not to have an impact on demand for air travel,” he said. “They [governments] do not want it to reduce demand. Air travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector.”\nQ&A\nWhat is air passenger duty?\nShow\nAir passenger duty, or APD, is a British tax on aviation, introduced in 1994. It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.\nIt is intended to incentivise passengers to seek alternative arrangements from flying, which is the most carbon-intensive form of transport. By reducing demand for flights, it seeks to decrease carbon emissions from the air industry.\nDestinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates – effectively for economy class, premium economy and business/first-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from £13 in economy to £78 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of £528.\nAirlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007.\nFlybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays £13 in APD.\nLong-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland.\nPhotograph: Pete Byrne/PA\nWas this helpful?\nYet the entire sector contributes only about £20bn to £30bn to the national economy, according to estimates, and leisure trips taken abroad by UK residents far outnumber those by tourists coming to the UK. Murray points to a deficit of about £23bn when the amount overseas tourists spend in the UK is subtracted from the amount British holidaymakers spend abroad.\nThat means, he says, there is economic space for far higher air passenger duty in the leisure sector. Long-haul business flyers could also pay far more without being discouraged from flying, as air passenger duty barely makes a difference to them. “We are bleeding money out of the country, and you could repatriate some of that by encouraging people to stay in the UK,” he says.\nOne of the fairest ways to curb emissions from flying would be a frequent flyer levy. The majority of flights are taken by a small minority of people – in a given year, most people in the UK do not fly at all, and most of those who do are taking one or perhaps two return flights on holiday. One-fifth of overseas flights are taken by just 1% of the population. The airline industry is kept afloat by well-off people spending more on their leisure, taking advantage of low prices to jet off frequently on short trips.\nA frequent flyer levy would allow people a small number of flights a year without charge or at a small charge, while each subsequent flight would attract a much higher toll. Critics say it could penalise people in the outer edges of the UK, such as the north of Scotland or Northern Ireland. But there could be ways to manage those impacts while ensuring that the environmental cost of cheap flights is accounted for.\nEncouraging rail travel could also play a big role in reducing emissions from domestic aviation. Germany has just slashed the price of rail travel, to encourage people to use the lower-carbon form of transport. Even more radically, France is considering restrictions or even a ban on some domestic flights.\nBoth those countries have well developed high-speed rail networks, however, which have benefited from public investment over decades. The UK has only one short stretch of high-speed rail, in the south-east, and plans for HS2 are still mired in controversy.\nThis November, the UK will host the crunch UN climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow, and the government’s green policies will be scrutinised on the international stage. As ministers consider cutting air passenger duty on domestic flights while regions compete for what is likely to be limited investment in the national rail networks, a coherent green transport policy looks further away than ever.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The report also argues that more active culling could reduce accidents on rural roads.\nWith no existing natural predators, the red deer population reached a peak of 400,000 in 2010. Deer management groups, often on sporting estates, kill certain numbers, but SEL wants the Scottish government to set and enforce higher targets.\nHigher cull targets could involve other people in the deer management, they say. Noting that “for centuries, red deer stalking in Scotland has relied on paying clients and guests of private landowners, supplemented by professional stalkers”, the report suggests that in other parts of Europe communities are more involved in deer control.\nAdvertisement\n“In Norway, for example, over half a million people – almost 10% of the population – are registered hunters. Hunting on state land is considered a communal source of sustainable food, and local people have priority use. Game meat is an important part of Norwegian food culture, rather than a byproduct of trophy hunting, as is often the case here.”\nSEL argues that a similar culture could be encouraged in Scotland, moving away from the kind of management that focuses on “wealthy clients seeking a pair of antlers”, which necessitates a much higher deer population and resultant environmental damage.\nThe report was published before the release of findings by the independent deer working group, set up by the Scottish government in 2017 to consider changes for management of the species.\nMike Daniels, head of land management at the John Muir Trust, said: “We believe there is a growing appetite for change in how Scotland’s uplands are managed into the 2020s and beyond, and delivering sustainable deer management is a critical component.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

He is making media investments through his own Lupa Systems company but continues to sit on the board of the family’s newspaper business, News Corp, which also owns the Times and the Sun.\nThe bushfires have focused attention on the likes of Andrew Bolt, a political commentator for News Corp’s Australian newspapers who is known for promoting the views of climate science deniers, and for his own attacks on “alarmists” and his derision of climate change science.\nHe also has a programme on the Murdoch-owned Sky News Australia, where he has criticised the “constant stream of propaganda” on the public broadcaster ABC about the role of the climate crisis in the bushfires.\n“Politicians who should do better are out there feeding the fear and misinformation,” he said in a recent broadcast criticising politicians who said carbon emissions needed to be cut to avoid future fires. “As if that would stop a fire. You’d have to be a child like Greta Thunberg to believe that fairytale.”\nUS viewers have also heard commentary from Fox News presenters such as Laura Ingraham, who has said that “celebrities in the media have been pressing the narrative that the wildfires in Australia are caused by climate change”, before introducing guests who cast doubt on this interpretation.\nJames Murdoch’s criticism sheds light on the family’s internal rifts, amid speculation over his 88-year-old father’s succession plans. James’s older brother Lachlan is still actively involved in the family businesses as the US-based chairman and chief executive of the slimmed-down Fox Corporation, which owns Fox News.\nLast year, Rupert Murdoch told shareholders “there are no climate change deniers” around his company and said his business was early to commit to “science-based targets to limit climate change” and was working to reduce its climate emissions.\nJames Murdoch: 'There are views I really disagree with' on Fox News\nRead more\nHowever, he has been publicly critical about the “alarmist” approach to the issue. In 2015, he used his Twitter account to describe himself as a “climate change sceptic not a denier”.\nLachlan Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and News Corp have all separately donated millions of dollars to bushfire recovery efforts in recent days, although the Daily Beast claimed the donations were made after it requested comment about James Murdoch’s statement.\nJames Murdoch has a long history of advocacy on environmental issues, inviting the former US vice-president Al Gore to present a version of his An Inconvenient Truth slideshow to Fox executives in 2006. At the time he was the heir apparent to the media empire and had been trusted with running BSkyB in London, where he would push environmental issues to the fore, working on ways to reduce the power used by Sky’s set-top boxes and insisting on using hybrid taxis long before such things were standard corporate behaviour.\nSince stepping back from day-to-day roles with the family business at the end of 2018, the multibillionaire has made clear he feels uncomfortable about much of Fox News’ output and was unsuccessful in an attempt to cash-in his stock completely and make a clean break with the company – an effort that failed after Lachlan declined to buy him out.\nKathryn Murdoch has already set out the couple’s vision, telling the New York Times last year that she was increasingly focused on the issue of global heating: “There hasn’t been a Republican answer on climate change. There’s just been denial and walking away from the problem. There needs to be one.”\nShe said she was particularly moved to act after seeing Al Gore’s speech at the Fox event in 2006: “I decided to switch everything I was doing. I wanted to be able to look my children in the eye and say ‘I did everything I could.’”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It tells us what the future world might look like. This really brings home what climate change means.”\nAverage temperature rises in Australia were about 1.4C above pre-industrial levels before this season’s fires, showing a more rapid rate of heating than the global average of 1.1C.\nScientists warn that beyond a rise of 2C, the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible, yet current global commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris agreement are estimated to put the world on track for 3C of heating.\n“These are the impacts we are seeing at 1C [of heating] so these impacts will get more [severe] as long as we do not do what it takes to stabilise the world climate,” warned Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science and policy at the University of East Anglia (UEA). “This is not a new normal – this is a transition to more impacts.”\nGlobal heating has led to an increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather – the conditions in which wildfires are likely to start – around the world, a review of 57 recent scientific papers has shown.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nBut land management to try to minimise fires had helped to reduce the number that would have been expected in Australia, said Matthew Jones, a research associate at UEA. “Climate change increases the frequency and severity of fire weather across the globe but humans have moderated how this risk translates into fire. Land management has reduced the incidence of fire globally.”\nHe said efforts to regrow forests after the fires have subsided would also help, by taking up the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that has been emitted as a result of the fires, though this would take decades of new tree growth.\nThe area of land burned around the world has decreased in recent years, the study found, largely owing to the clearing of savannahs for agriculture and people suppressing fires. More fires are also erupting in closed canopy forests, which is of particular concern as they are likely to result from forest degradation and climate breakdown.\nIn Australia, while recent rains have offered limited hope in some areas, there is not likely to be much greater relief in the next two months, according to Betts. While the Indian Ocean dipole weather system – which has brought hotter and drier conditions to Australia – has now passed its peak, weather systems in the eastern Pacific, which have brought hotter temperatures to Australia, are likely to continue and could result in continued hot and dry weather through January and February.\nBetts said the extreme bushfires in Australia showed what climate change would mean in reality, which many people found hard to imagine. The influence of human-induced climate change was clear in the Australian fires, he said, though more studies were likely to confirm this in the coming months.\nThe UEA will produce a study on carbon cycle feedbacks before the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow in November, when countries are expected to give stronger commitments on greenhouse gas emissions to fulfil the aims of the 2015 Paris agreement.\nQ&A\nWhat is Cop – and how will it help?\nShow\nFor almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.\nThe UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.\nThe negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority.\nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent\nWas this helpful?\nBetts added: “We are not going to reverse climate change, so the conditions that are happening now will not go away. These weather patterns will keep happening. If climate change continues, they will get more severe.”\nHowever, there is still a chance of avoiding the worst effects by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Betts said: “It is getting worse all the time. The sooner we rein back emissions, the sooner we can slow the increase.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Tying it up, he lingers.\n“I’m worried,” he says. “The quality is getting worse. The dates are getting drier.”\nLike thousands of farmers across the region, the effects of the climate crisis and water scarcity are threatening his livelihood. “When the quality is poor, we receive lower prices. I’m earning less. This year, I’ll earn a third of last year, which was an average year.”\nOn the road out of Bchelli, a gust of wind makes the sand rise like steam. Beyond the palm trees lies desert, a flat, barren terrain of scrub, rock and sand. Communities have survived here for thousands of years, but the changing environment may soon make it uninhabitable.\nOverall, temperatures here have risen by about 1C (1.8F) since 1988, according to data collected by the meteorological office in Tozeur, the capital of the region’s western district.\n“Temperatures used to peak in August and then fall, but now the heat persists until October,” says Taieb Foudhaili of South Organic, a date exporting company based in Kebili. Given this pattern of warming, humidity levels are falling and the plants adapt by releasing water. The result, says Foudhaili, is a drier, poorer product. His company must now do more sorting to maintain quality standards.\nGlobal heating has also created shorter periods during which date palms can flower and pollinate, according to Nabila el-Kadri, an agronomist based in Kebili. As a consequence, Kadri has observed a decline in the productivity of dates per hectare.\nAdvertisement\nBut it is not just rising temperatures causing anxiety. Over recent decades, and particularly after Tunisia’s 2011 revolution, unlawful plantations have spread like blots across the white landscape. The state has failed to exert proper controls. There are now 38,000 declared hectares (93,860 acres) of palm tree across the Kebili region, though Kadri believes the real figure could be as high as 50,000 hectares. More than half of the country’s dates are produced here.\nAfter olive production, dates are Tunisia’s second most valuable agricultural export, generating more than $200m (£154m) a year.\nA consequence is growing water scarcity: date palms are thirsty. On each plantation, Kadri estimates there are between 100 and 140 palm trees per hectare, with each tree requiring roughly 20–25,000 cubic metres of water each year. Neither natural springs nor groundwater can meet this demand.\nFarmers are resorting to drilling and pumping water from aquifers. There are now about 30,000 wells across the country, some hundreds of metres deep. As many as half of these were drilled illegally, according to a 2017 report by Tunisia’s Ministry of Agriculture, and less than half of the water from wells is not renewable.\nWater levels are being increasingly overexploited across southern Tunisia.\n“If we keep creating these new oases, with thousands of hectares of new trees, then over 10 to 15 years we won’t have any water left,” says Kadri.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA man sells dates, a valuable Tunisian export, in Kebili market. Photograph: Layli Foroudi/Reuters\nAdvertisement\nSome are already suffering. Rajeb says he has farmer friends who have already sold their trees in the new, poorly irrigated oases, because their crop was “so feeble”. Kadri says it is only a matter of time before date production as a whole will have to migrate north to Gafsa.\nUltimately, the problems of global heating and water scarcity facing Tunisia’s date farmers arise from a similar myopia: a common failure to see things holistically.\n“We are only thinking about the product,” says Foudhaili, “when we should be thinking about the air, the tree and the soil. We need to change the way we think.”\nMany of Tunisia’s modern palm plantations are monocultures, producing the valuable Deglet Noor variety of date and little else. When this crop fails, farmers have little to fall back on.\nLying in the shade of a palm tree in Chebika, 71-year-old Younes Belgasim is a figure of hope. His oasis is thriving.\nCan this woman open a new chapter for human rights in Tunisia?\nRead more\nHe is one of an estimated 18,000 people benefiting from a $5.7m World Bank project that launched in 2014. The project provided him with seeds for vegetables and fruit trees, helped him improve his land’s soil and irrigation, and allowed him to erect better fencing to protect his plot from local wild boars.\nThe initiative supported Belgasim to restore a “three-level” system of inter-cropping. On his oasis, the date palms give shade to vines, banana, pomegranate and fig trees, while vegetables and wild grasses grow beneath.\nThis system demands more from farmers, and it may deliver less immediate commercial payoff than date production. Both factors may deter farmers looking to earn their revenue in one date harvest season.\nBut while some inter-cropping farmers in the oases say the system can demand more water, they also report that it maintains humidity levels, improves the soil quality and strengthens biodiversity. It also diversifies farmers’ assets.\nThese successes suggest ecosystem-based farming can be a win-win: protecting farmers from climate, economic or disease-related shocks, while also preserving the natural environment. For this reason, Belgasim is more relaxed about the future.\n“It is getting hotter,” he says, “but I’m not worried about climate change.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The document, issued to schools, included instructions to look out for those who use “strong or emotive terms” when discussing climate change or pollution. Since 2015, teachers have been under a statutory duty to refer students suspected of extremist sympathies to the anti-terror Prevent programme, with education now the main source of referrals (in 2017-18 these included 2009 children under 15).\nA suggestion that participation “in planned school walkouts” could be grounds for suspicion is particularly egregious, given that the school strike movement’s stated aim is for governments to act on climate scientists’ warnings. But what is particularly dispiriting about this ill-judged document is that the bracketing of green groups with terrorists is far from a one-off. Instead, and as numerous activists spied on by police in the past know (including an unknown number of women tricked into sexual relationships by officers), the treatment of environmentalists as dangerous subversives is consistent with longstanding attitudes to green issues at the highest levels of the British state.\nAdvertisement\nSuch views do not have a monopoly. Sir Peter Fahy, the former police chief who led Prevent from 2010 to 2015, has criticised the approach to Extinction Rebellion as counterproductive. But at a time when public concern about the climate emergency in many countries has never been higher, with bushfires ravaging Australia and new analysis showing record rises in ocean temperatures, the decision of the home secretary, Priti Patel, to highlight alleged “security risks” from green groups when asked about the issue is grounds for alarm. Climate policymaking is a global challenge and the stakes in 2020 could not be higher. If legally binding cuts on greenhouse gas emissions are not agreed at a crunch round of UN talks in December, then the world will be in a very dark place indeed (experts say emissions must be reduced by 7.6% per year for a decade if we are to avoid the most destructive scenarios).\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nWith that summit due to be held in Glasgow, the UK government has a vital role to play. But so does civil society, including activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion. The litany of failures of climate policy so far suggests that unless millions of people exert pressure on their leaders, governments will fail to take the necessary steps.\nIn this context, it is a grotesque distortion of reality to suggest that young people who join peaceful climate protests bear any resemblance to terrorists. Fossil fuel companies, and asset managers such as Vanguard that consistently oppose climate resolutions, show far greater recklessness with regard to human life. Extinction Rebellion’s founders may declare support for alternatives to capitalism, but their grasp of climate science belongs not beyond the pale, but in the mainstream.\nOf course, the police must prepare for the disruption caused by civil disobedience. Such actions do not command universal support and in some cases are planned to maximise pressure on police resources. But none of this has anything to do with counter-terrorism. The government’s delayed review of Prevent must now take place, with a thorough examination of this episode as part of its remit, and clear advice as to how those affected can seek redress.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Neubauer had hoped to persuade Kaeser to withdraw from the project, for which Siemens has won an €18m contract to provide the rail infrastructure.\nAt the meeting in Berlin, Neubauer was offered a position by Kaeser in either the supervisory board or leadership council of Siemens Energy, a spin-off business which hopes to head a new generation of energy-efficient technology. It is due to split from the main company in the spring and to go public in September on Germany’s Dax index.\nShe said on Monday she had turned down the offer. “If I were to take it up, I would be obliged to represent the company’s interests and could never be an independent critic of Siemens,” she explained. “That is not compatible with my role as [a] climate activist.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nNeubauer and Greta Thunberg in Berlin in March 2019. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images\nThe Carmichael mine was approved by the Austalian government in June and will be run by the Indian company Adani. It has become a cause for climate protesters who disapprove of a project which will contribute to global heating – especially at a time when large parts of Australia are already being wracked by bushfires blamed on the climate crisis.\nAdvertisement\nKaeser, who has made much of the company’s pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030, last month tweeted his recognition of the activists’ complaints about the mine, promising he would “diligently look into the matter” and “get back” to the protesters. He pointed out a decision would “not be easy” due to the various interest groups involved, including shareholders, customers and the public.\nBut on Sunday, following an extraordinary meeting of Siemens management, Kaeser announced the company was to go ahead with the project as it was legally obliged to remain committed to it, adding that at the same time it would become increasingly watchful of environmental concerns.\n“We have evaluated all the options and have concluded that we must fulfil our contractual obligations,” he tweeted. He promised the company would improve its future management of “protecting the environment” by establishing what he called “an effective Sustainability Board”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nActivists say the coalmine project will produce an annual 27.5m tonnes of coal and will contribute to global heating. They also point to the vast amounts of water it will require, as well as destruction of habitat and the need to transport the coal via the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef in the world.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation called the decision “disastrous”, and pledged to continue its protests against the mine. It added: “With this decision, the company is showing its true face ... its climate change strategies have been revealed to be meaningless and hollow.”\nNeubauer has referred to the Siemens’ project as an “inexcusable mistake”.\nShe told the news agency DPA: “We asked Kaeser to do everything possible to stop the Adani mine. Instead he will now profit from this disastrous project.\n“This is so last century, and Joe Kaeser is making an unforgivable mistake,” she added, emphasising that Siemens’ decision threatened climate goals to reduce the rise in global warming by two degrees.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

With emissions still rising every year, more heat is being trapped by greenhouse gases, and the ocean data is crystal clear: an unrelenting and accelerating rise for at least the past half century. Lijing Cheng, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: “There are no reasonable alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat-trapping gases to explain this.”\nAren’t surface air temperatures more important?\nWe live on the surface of the Earth, and so air temperature is the most common heat measurement. But two-thirds of the planet’s area is ocean and water can absorb far more heat than air. As a result, just 4% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases warms the air and land.\nSo to really see what is happening with global heating, you need to look at the oceans. Here, the signal is unmistakable, with every year in the past decade recording hotter oceans that the year before, bar one. In contrast, air temperature is more affected by the natural variation that overlies human-caused global heating. The hottest year for air temperature to date is 2016, thanks to an El Niño event, though 2019 may slot in at number two when the final data is available.\nWe live on land, so why worry about the oceans?\nAdvertisement\nThe oceans and atmosphere are inextricably linked. Changing ocean heat means changing rains, and that means more floods in some places and more droughts and wildfires in others. Furthermore, hotter oceans mean more sea level rise, threatening cities from Shanghai to Miami and Rio de Janeiro to Alexandria.\nHotter oceans also supercharge storms, with Kevin Trenberth at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research noting that a hotspot in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017 spawned Hurricane Harvey. That led to 82 deaths and caused about $108bn in damage. In 2018, a hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean near the Carolinas led to Hurricane Florence.\nWhat about marine life?\nMany coral reefs are already suffering from bleaching. But the increasing number of ocean heatwaves are affecting all life. For example, the hot “blob” seen in the North Pacific from 2013 to 2015 caused a major loss of marine life, from plankton and fish – including 100 million cod – to marine mammals such as whales.\nIs the record ocean heat a tipping point?\nNo, but it might lead to some. Climate tipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests, or the release of the potent greenhouse gas methane from melting tundra. Some scientists think the world may already have crossed a series of tipping points. If so, the buildup of heat graphically demonstrated in the oceans shows why.\nCan anything be done?\nYes. The way to end global heating and tackle the climate emergency is to stop emitting greenhouse gases. Most importantly that means a rapid end to fossil fuel burning, plus the protection and regeneration of forests and cutting down emissions from farming, in particular from cattle. There is no time to lose.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Higher temperatures are also harming life in the seas, with the number of marine heatwaves increasing sharply.\nThe most common measure of global heating is the average surface air temperature, as this is where people live. But natural climate phenomena such as El Niño events mean this can be quite variable from year to year.\n“The oceans are really what tells you how fast the Earth is warming,” said Prof John Abraham at the University of St Thomas, in Minnesota, US, and one of the team behind the new analysis. “Using the oceans, we see a continued, uninterrupted and accelerating warming rate of planet Earth. This is dire news.”\n“We found that 2019 was not only the warmest year on record, it displayed the largest single-year increase of the entire decade, a sobering reminder that human-caused heating of our planet continues unabated,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, US, and another team member.\nAdvertisement\nThe analysis, published in the journal Advances In Atmospheric Sciences, uses ocean data from every available source. Most data is from the 3,800 free-drifting Argo floats dispersed across the oceans, but also from torpedo-like bathythermographs dropped from ships in the past.\nThe results show heat increasing at an accelerating rate as greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. The rate from 1987 to 2019 is four and a half times faster than that from 1955 to 1986. The vast majority of oceans regions are showing an increase in thermal energy.\nThis energy drives bigger storms and more extreme weather, said Abraham: “When the world and the oceans heat up, it changes the way rain falls and evaporates. There’s a general rule of thumb that drier areas are going to become drier and wetter areas are going to become wetter, and rainfall will happen in bigger downbursts.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.

The past 10 years also show the highest sea level measured in records dating back to 1900. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, enough to displace 150 million people worldwide.\nDan Smale, at the Marine Biological Association in the UK, and not part of the analysis team, said the methods used are state of the art and the data is the best available. “For me, the take-home message is that the heat content of the upper layers of the global ocean, particularly to 300 metre depth, is rapidly increasing, and will continue to increase as the oceans suck up more heat from the atmosphere,” he said.\nHeatwaves sweeping oceans ‘like wildfires’, scientists reveal\nRead more\nAdvertisement\n“The upper layers of the ocean are vital for marine biodiversity, as they support some of the most productive and rich ecosystems on Earth, and warming of this magnitude will dramatically impact on marine life,” Smale said.\nThe new analysis assesses the heat in the top 2,000m of the ocean, as that is where most of the data is collected. It is also where the vast majority of the heat accumulates and where most marine life lives.\nThe analysis method was developed by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and uses statistical methods to interpolate heat levels in the few places where there was no data, such as under the Arctic ice cap. An independent analysis of the same data by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration shows that same increasing heat trend.\nReliable ocean heat measurements stretch back to the middle of the 20th century. But Abraham said: “Even before that, we know the oceans were not hotter.”\n“The data we have is irrefutable, but we still have hope because humans can still take action,” he said. “We just haven’t taken meaningful action yet.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Solar activity! Volcanoes! Greenland!\nNow of course the feculent minds of columnists and government MPs will continue to spout these lies – when has reality ever been an impediment to their effluent-driven utterances? But the months of fires across southern Queensland, northern New South Wales, the horrors of Gippsland, the NSW south coast and Kangaroo Island over Christmas and new year, the smoke haze across Sydney and Canberra and now Melbourne, has shifted forwards their timetable of obfuscation.\nExplainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?\nRead more\nFive months ago they could still get away with wheeling out the “now is not the time” line, or to confidently state that you cannot link this bushfire to climate change.\nBut now such lines are greeted with universal scorn.\nLast year was the hottest and driest calendar year in Australia’s recorded history. That created the conditions for the fires, and they do not exist without climate change.\nAt this point any climate change denier with access to a social media account will tell you that rainfall has actually increased over the past century in Australia. That is true, and also utterly irrelevant and designed to mislead.\nClimate change impacts have only really taken off since the late 1960s and early 70s, and not surprisingly, given the size and differing climates of Australia, the impact on rainfall has varied.\nOver the past 50 years the trend rate of rainfall in northern Australia has barely changed – if anything, it has risen a bit (great if you like rain and you live in Broome) but in south-eastern Australia the trend is clearly falling:\nSo now that they are unable to say “now is not the time”, they have adapted.\nRather than suggest no connection with climate change, they have shifted to arguing there is no connection between any particular climate change policy and bushfires.\nScott Morrison argued last week on ABC’s 7.30: “You cannot link any individual single emissions reduction policy of a country – whether it’s Australia or anyone else – to any specific fire event. I mean, that’s just absurd.”\nNothing Scott Morrison has said suggests any change in policy that will actually involve emissions reductions\nYes, it is absurd, because no one is actually arguing that. But the prime minister is very good at defeating arguments no one is making.\nHe is also very good at giving false hope. Right now columnists and journalists are writing articles expressing belief that maybe Morrison is about to shift the government’s climate change policy.\nPerhaps he will, but I have seen Charlie Brown try to kick this football before and I remain unpersuaded because I have listened to what the prime minister himself has said just this past week.\nThree times David Speers asked him on Sunday if the government would increase its emissions targets. Morrison responded with: “Well, the cabinet and the government will continue to evolve our policies.” Then he added: “What I’m saying is I’m not going to put someone’s job at risk, a region’s, town’s future at risk.” And finally: “What I’m saying is we want to reduce emissions and do the best job we possibly can and get better and better and better at it.”\nWhat he is saying is “no”. Nothing he has said suggests any change in policy that will actually involve emissions reductions.\nScott Morrison to focus on 'resilience and adaptation' to address climate change\nRead more\nInstead he has quickly adopted the new go-to response of climate change deniers – that of the need to adapt and “improve resilience”.\nWhat does that mean? It means the next step in climate change denial – a step I joked grimly last month was not far away.\nAlas, it is no longer a joke.\nThe new argument is that, yes climate change is probably to blame, but we can’t do anything about it, and anyway it’s too late now, so let’s “adapt”. And what does that adaptation involve? According to Morrison: “Building dams is key to that. Native vegetation management is key to that. Land clearing is key to that.”\nIn other words doing the very things conservatives have been desirous of for the past century – building dams, reducing national parks and increasing land clearing.\nThey will hand out grants to organisations and areas most electorally beneficial and all the while trumpet that they are dealing with the issue in a practical way, unlike the opposition which, they argue, will be trying to kill jobs.\nConservatives hate dealing with the actual source of problems – they much prefer handing out the graft; which is appropriate when you realise climate change denialism is the biggest con in political and media history.\nAnd of course emissions will rise while they suggest they are actually being reduced.\nThe line from Morrison is that we will “meet and beat” our Paris emissions reductions targets. The current figures from his own government show that rather than reduce emissions in 2030 by 26% below 2005 levels, we are on track to cut them by just 16%.\nBut the real problem – one that needs much more attention than interviewers now give it – is the 26% target itself has no basis in science as being anywhere near enough to keep temperatures below 1.5C.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nScott Morrison at the defence staging ground on Kangaroo Island. Photograph: David Mariuz/AAP\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2018 that to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5C, C02 emissions needed to “decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050”.\nEven as an air pollution expert, these months of bushfire smoke have been a shock\nNancy Cushing for the Conversation\nRead more\nForty-five per cent, not 26%. And that is a 45% reduction of actual emissions, not including farcical “land use” figures. When we exclude land use, our 26% target really becomes closer to 15%.\nMorrison boasting that Australia will meet and beat its target is like someone boasting that they are beating their target of 10 minutes of exercise a day, and hoping everyone ignores that doctors recommended 30 minutes.\nA 45% cut of real emissions is well below what the government is targeting and miles below our current projections:\nThe reality is, even while including land use, we are still well short of where we need to be:\nAnd so we enter the next stage of climate change politics – a subtle and sinister shift – the talk will be about practical measures of adaptation rather than of reducing emissions: gone will be direct action, in its place will be “direct adaptation”.\nIt is a stage that, if successful, will signal the end for our planet.\nGreg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The department is relying on exemptions in the FOI act that block the release of “deliberative matter” – material that has been used in the making of decisions.\n“I consider that there is no identifiable benefit or public interest to release this type of draft information,” the department’s decision-maker said.\n“Release of the deliberations that form part of the drafting process would undermine the value and authority of the final Climate Change Action Strategy. I therefore consider that it would not be in the public interest to release the draft Climate Change Action Strategy.”\nPayne was previously questioned about delays to the release of the final report during Senate estimates, following reports her office had sat on it for months. She said the release of the final report was delayed because changes were required to “better reflect our international climate change engagement prior to the Paris Agreement coming into effect in 2020, particularly noting – for those who are oblivious – that we have just had a federal election”.\nAdvertisement\n“The government wants to take the opportunity to make sure that strategies such as this and other relevant documentation are contemporary and are relevant to the changes in our commitments, which will be seen under the Paris Agreement,” Payne said in July.\nBut Faruqi said the refusal to release the draft version “absolutely smacks of a cover-up”. She said the argument that there was no public interest in its release “makes no sense” and raised suspicion about efforts to keep it secret.\n“This strategy appears to have sat on the foreign minister’s desk for almost nine months and we simply don’t know how it was altered in that time,” she said. “The public has a right to know whether the government politically interfered to water down the strategy.”\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nA department spokeswoman said the draft strategy was updated during the nine months to better reflect new government initiatives, including the announcement of $500m for climate and disaster resilience in the Pacific and $140m for a fund to mobilise the private sector on climate change.\n“An early draft of the Strategy was sent to the Foreign Minister’s Office in February 2019,” she said. “After the Government went into caretaker mode and the election was held, the Morrison Government made a number of decisions to build climate resilience and mitigation through the Pacific Step-up. The Strategy therefore needed to take these new initiatives into account.”\nOther changes between the draft and the final version included a stronger focus on social inclusion, updates to climate finance data, updated source references, and the addition of “more current case studies”, the spokeswoman said.\nPacific nations have previously expressed frustration at Australia’s intransigence on climate change. During last year’s Pacific Islands Forum, Australia attempted to distance itself from language calling for urgent action on climate change, putting it at odds with other nations.\nIt was successful in removing almost all references to coal and had worked hard to soften the language on climate change.\nThe foreign affairs department has been approached for a response.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The scientists calculated that this increase would result in about 2,100 more fatal injuries every year in the US alone.\nPeople tend to go outside more and drink more alcohol on hotter days, while higher temperatures are known to increase rates of violence and suicide. The analysis did show a small reduction in the number of deaths related to falls among elderly people, probably because there is less ice in winter.\nPrevious research on the impact of the climate emergency on health has focused on chronic diseases such as heart failure and infectious diseases including malaria. But deaths from injuries currently make up about 10% of all fatalities around the world and the impact of global heating on this had been little studied until now.\nThe scientists say young people play vital roles in supporting societies and economies and that measures to tackle deaths from injury must be a public health priority.\n“Our results show how much climate change can affect young people,” said Prof Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London. “We need to respond to this threat with better preparedness in terms of emergency services, social support and health warnings.”\nInjury deaths were expected to increase in all nations as temperatures rose, he said, although local factors would influence the extent of the increase – for example, the standard of road safety or level of gun control. The world is currently on track for a 3-4C temperature rise, suggesting the increase in injury deaths could be even higher.\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, is based on data on recorded deaths from injuries in every county in the mainland US between 1980 to 2017. It also used temperature data to find the months when the average temperature was 2C higher than usual. This enabled the researchers to account for the fact that people adapt to normal local conditions but are affected by unusual temperatures.\n'Like a sunburn on your lungs': how does the climate crisis impact health?\nRead more\nComparing the data allowed the scientists to estimate the annual increase in deaths that would result from a 2C rise. Men are already much more likely than women to die from injuries and the researchers found that 84% of the additional deaths were among men.\nThe most affected age group was 15-34. Road crashes accounted for 42% of the extra deaths and suicide 30%. Deaths from violence and from drowning both made up about 14% of the total. Drownings increase in hot weather as more people swim.\n“There is a long history of work that shows injuries are fundamentally seasonal,” said Ezzati. “Some of this is obvious – people drown more in summer. We also know that warmth influences both our physiology and our behaviour.”\nThe reasons deaths from suicide and violent assault increase in hot weather are not fully understood. But the researchers said it was possible that people spending more time outdoors had a higher risk of confrontations.\nPeople also tend to be more agitated in hot weather, and may drink more alcohol, which could lead to more assaults. Previous research indicates that high temperatures are associated with higher levels of mental distress, especially in young people.\nInjuries already kill more that 5 million people a year, more than HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and such deaths are rising. Policies to tackle the climate emergency should include measures to combat deaths from injuries, said Shanthi Ameratunga and Alistair Woodward of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in an accompanying commentary on the research.\n“The need to address this major public health problem is particularly urgent in low- and middle-income countries that experience over 80% of the global injury burden and are generally more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather,” they said.\n“The public health community tend to forget that injury deaths are actually a pretty big factor [in overall mortality],” said Ezzati. “The emphasis on young people is an important aspect of the story, as they are educationally and economically active.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The 2019 figures are also well below the average set over the last decade of 208 new projects a year.\nRenewable UK warned that the UK risked falling short of its aim of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 as the pipeline of projects that clinched support before the schemes were closed begins to run dry.\nRebecca Williams, a director at Renewable UK, said the figures showed that the government’s current approach was falling short on the clean electricity needed to meet the UK’s legally binding climate targets.\n“This is a flashing red warning light on our net zero dashboard and we urgently need a new strategy from government,” she said.\nThe findings are likely to increase pressure on the government to reverse the block on government support for new onshore windfarms, put in place by the former Tory prime minister David Cameron in 2016.\nThe current energy policy blocks onshore wind developers from competing for support contracts, and has caused the rollout of new onshore wind capacity to fall to 629 megawatts (MW) last year, or a quarter of the onshore wind growth recorded two years ago.\nThe government’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has suggested that the UK’s onshore wind capacity should increase by almost threefold in the next 15 years to meet climate goals at low cost.\nThis would require the UK to grow its onshore wind capacity from 13,000 MW now to 35,000 MW by 2035, or an average of more that 1,400MW a year.\nOffshore windfarms 'can provide more electricity than the world needs'\nRead more\nThe sole addition to the UK’s fleet of onshore wind farms under the government’s current energy policy last year – the Withernwick II project, in the East Riding of Yorkshire – has a capacity of 8MW, with just four turbines.\n“Onshore wind is one of the cheapest low carbon technologies in the UK, quick to build, and it’s hugely popular as the government’s own opinion polls show 78% of people support it,” Williams said. “As ministers get down to work at the start of a new decade, we need to see new policies which support the full range of clean power sources to transform our energy system.”\nScottishPower, a major developer of renewable energy, has started planning for a major expansion of onshore windfarm projects across Scotland in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects.\nLindsay McQuade, the chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, told the Guardian late last year that “if the commitment of net zero is to be a reality, I expect to see support from government to match it”.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Now a decade of blackouts lies ahead","paragraph":"I\nn 2019, millions of Californians experienced a wildfire safety blackout, some for nearly a week at a time, as the troubled utility company Pacific Gas & Electric and other investor-owned utilities grappled with replacing one devastating disaster with another, comparatively manageable one.\n2019 was not an anomaly, but the beginning of a new way of life for many California residents. While “de-energization” for fire safety has been state policy for more than a decade, it had never before been used on such a mass scale. According to utility experts, politicians and PG&E, customers can expect many more years of blackouts to come, as fire risk in California’s hills only increases.\n“Wildfire blackouts could be California’s new normal for the next 10 to 30 years, or even longer,” the Senate energy committee chair, Lisa Murkowski, told a hearing on utility and fire safety in December.\nTen or more years of blackouts ahead\nIn stark contrast to recent years past, California’s 2019 wildfire season was relatively mild: just 732 structures destroyed, compared with the tens of thousands and dozens killed in 2017 and 2018.\nThe crisis of 2019’s fire season was less the fires themselves, and more the actions taken that were meant to prevent fires from igniting in the first place. Intended as a measure of last resort, California power utilities conducted nine public safety power shutoffs in the fall of 2019 in an effort to reduce wildfire risk in hot, windy weather conditions – and to reduce liability costs to utilities.\nPG&E: what’s next for the utility at the center of California’s wildfires\nRead more\nThose costs following deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 fires linked to equipment belonging to PG&E, drove the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019, and to reconsider how to manage the grid during future fire weather events.\nBill Johnson, PG&E’s CEO, has at different times claimed his utility – the largest in the state – would resort to blackouts for the next three, five or 10 years.\nThe southern California investor-owned utility San Diego Gas and Electric “is the poster child for safety”, said Michael Wara, the director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment. SDG&E has been de-energizing its lines during fire weather events for more than a decade.\nAdvertisement\n“Why is it that PG&E thinks it’s going to be able to replicate what San Diego’s done and do even better over a larger area in less time? It’s not impossible, but it’s an enormously challenging task,” said Wara.\nPG&E’s post-de-energization reports to the state utilities commission showed a number of hazards after each event, from damaged lines and conductors to fallen trees. After its largest shutoff at the end of October, the utility noted more than 100 individual hazards.\n“Would every piece of system damage that they noted have caused a fire? Probably not. But some of them probably would have,” said Wara. “[Public safety power shutoff policy] is so unpopular, and it impacts so many people, I worry we will be pushed to be overly optimistic about other potential avenues for creating safety.”\nDespite the widespread shutoffs, PG&E equipment was still tied to igniting several fires in the fall of 2019, including the Kincade fire in Sonoma county, which destroyed 352 structures and burned more than 77,000 acres.\n“It’s not clear to me that the system is that much safer than 2017,” Wara said. “The safety that we had this season and the absence of fires during these dangerous wind events was due to the fact that the wires weren’t hot.”\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nElijah Carter 11, left, and Robert Haralson, 12, shop in a darkened supermarket in Santa Rosa, California, during a blackout.

We are working hard now to narrow the scope and duration of future safety shutoffs and minimize their customer impact as much as possible,” Johnson told the Senate hearing.\nBut he also took credit for the less destructive 2019 fire season: “PG&E’s [public safety power shutoff] program achieved its singular goal: there was no loss of life during wildfires in 2019.”\nNot everyone in California is convinced that success is PG&E’s to claim.\nWill Abrams and his family lost their home in the 2017 Tubbs fire that destroyed more than 5,600 structures and killed 22 people. They were forced to evacuate again from the 2019 Kincade fire.\n“The fact that our firefighters went in and did an amazing job, learned from prior fires and got these more under control shouldn’t be a PG&E victory lap,” said Abrams. “I would argue that the shutoffs provide a disincentive for other mitigation. Because if you can just pull the power, you don’t have to do the vegetation management and the microgrids and all the other stuff you need to do.”\nAll of that “other stuff” is enormously expensive and labor-intensive and will take years to complete.\nAnd the costs of installing stronger poles and trimming trees will not just be borne by the company’s profits. CEO Johnson has said ratepayers will not be on the hook for the costs associated with the company’s bankruptcy, but they will have to foot some of the bill for grid upgrades and maintenance. Customers saw their rates increase again on 1 January, though not as much as the utility would have liked. PG&E customers already pay some of the highest prices in the country for power, and those prices will only increase.\nPG&E expects to reinforce 7,100 miles of line in fire risky areas in the next 12 to 14 years. To date, the utility has completed just 129 miles.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nPacific Gas & Electric crews work on power lines in Paradise, California.

In 2019, at Newsom’s urging, the legislature passed new legislation that created a wildfire liabilities fund, and placed a June deadline for PG&E to leave bankruptcy.\nCritics argued that both bills were essentially bailouts for investor-owned utilities. “I voted no on both of them – I thought that they shifted financial responsibility on to Californians and neglected to raise public safety to the paramount priority,” said assembly member Marc Levine. “De-energization was a massive failure.”\nWhile California’s fires have been orders of magnitude more destructive than the blackouts, they touch just a fraction of the millions who had their lights turned off in 2019 – making de-energization a hotter problem for politicians and PG&E to solve.They have just a few months before the next fire season begins.\nThree new pieces of legislation introduced in the state legislature’s first week back in 2020 aimed at addressing a troubled PG&E, regardless of the bankruptcy’s resolution.\nA new proposal from Levine would install a public administrator from the state regulatory commission for a period of six months to oversee all the functions of a floundering investor-owned utility.\n“We need to stop treating PG&E like a business to keep solvent and more like a convicted felon that needs to be held accountable,” said Levine.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA road sign calls for PG&E to turn the power back on in Calistoga, California.

It was described as the largest coordinated action of its kind and for a few hours the oil stopped flowing.\nThe five climate activists, members of Climate Direct Action, cut their way through fencing and turned the valves. The activists notified the energy companies whose pipelines were being disrupted and posted videos of their protest online and waited patiently to be arrested.\nAdvertisement\nThey have since been dubbed the “Valve Turners”, profiled in the New York Times magazine and featured in a recent documentary titled The Reluctant Radical. Their trials have also tested the willingness of courts to allow climate activists to make use of the necessity defense – the idea that a criminal action is justified if it helps to prevent greater future harm – as part of a legal strategy.\nBut the group’s actions attracted the attention of the DHS.\nIn a recent intelligence bulletin evaluating domestic terrorism threats between 2018 and 2020, the department included the Valve Turners and described the group as “suspected environmental rights extremists”.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe document also listed two of the group’s members alongside violent white supremacists and other extremists who have engaged in mass killings, including the man behind the racist 2015 slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.\nThe document obtained by the not-for-profit Property of the People through a Foia request defines domestic terrorism as “any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources” and that is intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government body. The assessment is directed at departmental leadership and is based on a review of roughly 80 violent incidents between 2014 and 2017, according to the document.\nThe document points to an uptick in “sabotage attacks” conducted by anarchist extremists, environmental rights and animal rights extremists against the Dakota Access pipeline in 2016 at the height of the pipeline protest. Nearly 800 activists have been tried on a variety of North Dakota state charges, in relation to the pipeline protests, according to Water Protector Legal Collective, a legal support organization.\nThis activity was met with heavy law enforcement presence, FBI and DHS surveillance, and aggressive military style tactics deployed by pipeline security contractors.\nIn addition to providing an overview of domestic terrorism threats the document includes an appendix summarizing select incidents over the past few years. Two of the Valve Turners are listed alongside violent white supremacists such as Dylann Roof and James Fields, who have both been convicted of murdering innocent civilians. Roof killed nine black churchgoers in a rampage in South Carolina. Fields drove his car into a group of activists protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring at least 19 others.\nThe document also states that “racial and environmentally themed ideologies” were among the primary drivers of terrorist attacks in the United States during this time.\nMike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in an email that\nthe DHS framing was “highly misleading because white supremacists are responsible for the bulk of this violence and almost all of the fatalities that result”. “There is little evidence,” he added, “that environmentalists have engaged in the types of deadly violence that would meet the statutory definition of domestic terrorism, as codified by Congress”.\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nSam Jessup, one of the activists named in the document, said the bulletin shed light on the role law enforcement and intelligence agencies have played in suppressing dissent.\n“Equating mass murder by white supremacists with what Michael and I did is totally obscene,” Jessup said in an email. “This whole infrastructure of so-called security has done little more than secure the future of the fossil fuel industry by terrorizing people into silence.”\nJessup, 34, served as a driver and videographer, live-streaming the action in North Dakota. Michael Foster, a former family therapist who lives in Seattle, turned the valve.\nFoster said even though the action involved a high level of legal risk, it was a small price to pay in light of the cascading impacts of climate change.\n“The only way to force society to change fast enough is to refuse to participate and fill the jails,” Foster said.\nBoth he and Jessup were convicted on felony conspiracy charges and Foster spent six months in jail. During closing arguments the prosecutor compared Foster to the Unabomber and the 9/11 hijackers. He is now on probation and barred from engaging in direct action protest for another two years.\nIn the more than three years since the action , several states have passed legislation making it a crime to trespass on property containing critical infrastructure.The Trump administration has advocated for stiffer penalties against activists who engage in non-violent direct action targeting fossil fuel infrastructure.\nCarl Williams, executive director of the Water Protector Legal Collective, which has defended a number of DAPL protesters, says the push to criminalize dissent is part of a larger rightwing strategy that has also targeted the BDS movement and Black Lives Matter.\n“I think there is a strategy that rightwing forces are using to criminalize dissent,” Williams said. “This bulletin shows that dirty hand.”\nBut Williams also says it shows that these same movements are making inroads. “Liberation movements know that this is happening and we’re fighting against it,” he said. “They’re doing this because they’re afraid of the power of these movements.”\nAdam Federman is a reporting fellow with Type Investigations.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The situation was urgent, yes, and catastrophe was more or less imminent, but when people talked about it they mostly stuck to the future tense. It’s hard to identify the precise moment when the crisis moved from the horizon of popular imagination to the immediate foreground, but the spectacle in recent weeks of a continent in flames feels like a clear indication that the time of looming has ended and the catastrophe proper has commenced.\nThe other day I messaged an Australian friend, a volunteer firefighter in Melbourne who had spent the week between Christmas and new year in East Gippsland, where thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes. After informing me she was home and safe, and requesting that I arrange for some Irish rain to be redirected down there, she sent me a photo she had taken on the job: an image of a narrow dusty road leading toward low hills dotted with trees, behind which the sky itself was a vast inferno of dark smoke and glowing flame. I stared at her photo for a long time, and kept returning to it all that day.\nThe images of the bushfires look like a film. Like a video game. Like we always imagined the end of the world would look like\nThere was something both bizarre and instructive about the image, the way in which the gentle bucolic scene in the foreground was juxtaposed surreally against the literally hellish sky behind it. It made me think of René Magritte’s Empire of Light series of paintings, in which scenes of a residential street at night are presided over by a bright, daylit sky.\nIt also made me think of what life is basically like now: a calm foreground with an inferno on the horizon. And it struck me that this would be a thing that would happen at the end of the world. People would point their phones at the fire in the sky, and they would send photos to their friends in other places. “This is what the apocalypse looks like here,” they would say. “How is it where you are?” There would be a great storm of content and engagement, and then there would be nothing at all.\nAdvertisement\nOne thing that is often remarked about climate crisis is that the subject is characterised by a strange form of cognitive dissonance. You read about the melting ice caps, the rising temperatures, the mass extinctions, and you understand intellectually that something truly terrible is happening. It doesn’t feel like that on the nerve endings, though. On the nerve endings, it feels like an unseasonably warm day in January. But what is happening in Australia, and the images that are emerging from the fires, feels like a closing of the gap between the scientific evidence and the field of immediate perception.\nA little boy in a facemask in a small boat at sea, his hand on the outboard tiller, the sky behind him an incandescent haze. Two horses in silhouette against a burning forest. Crowds of masked people taking refuge on a beach. That same beach littered with the corpses of tropical birds. A kangaroo burned alive, trapped by a barbed wire fence. All these scenes suffused with a malignant red glow, as though put through an Instagram filter named “Inferno”. It looks like a film. It looks like a video game. It looks like what we have always imagined the end of the world would look like.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nCrews monitor the fires between the towns of Orbost and Lakes Entrance in East Gipplsland, Victoria Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images\nIn East Gippsland, where my friend had been dispatched to fight the fires after Christmas, the situation was so severe that the government issued an emergency warning telling the remaining residents that it was too late to evacuate. “You are in danger,” read the warning, “and need to act immediately to survive.”\nHere on the other side of the world, thousands of miles from the immediate peril of the fires, it’s impossible not to read this as a warning about the broader climate emergency. It’s the message we’ve been hearing from scientists and activists for decades.\nAnd it is undoubtedly the message of those apocalyptic images from Australia, bathed in the crimson radiance of catastrophe. If God himself were to materialise and deliver this message, it could not be any clearer, any more urgent. You may recall, in fact, that it was by means of a burning bush that God announced it was time to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.\nYet the most disturbing thing about the images of the fires is not that they might signal the end of the world, but that they might signal how the world will continue. That we might just get used to large parts of the planet being on fire, and even larger parts of it being underwater. And more disturbing still, that we might harden our hearts against the people who live and die in the floods and the fires.\nDisinformation and lies are spreading faster than Australia's bushfires\nRead more\nBecause when I look at the images of those Australians crowded on the beaches, fleeing the smoke and the flames, there is a kind of double exposure effect, whereby I see the ghostly image of those other refugees who have come by boat to Australia from places where they were no longer safe, only to be held indefinitely and in appalling conditions on offshore detention facilities in the South Pacific. In the rest of the world, their suffering has been mostly ignored. These people know better than anyone what an apocalypse looks like.\nIt’s not the melting of the ice-caps or the burning of the forests that seem to me to be the real apocalyptic scenario, but rather the slow atrophying of our moral imaginations; not the inferno itself, but the indifference of those of us who are not yet on fire. In this sense above all we are in danger, and we need to act immediately to survive.\n• Mark O’Connell is a writer based in Dublin.

Since 2012, students have campaigned to marginalise companies like Shell and BP which profit from climate breakdown.\nThe campaign, supported by the National Union of Students,People & Planet and Students Organising for Sustainability UK, has shown the power of students taking collective action. The University of Glasgow was the first UK university to divest in October 2014, and was soon followed by major divestments after sustained campaigns at institutions including Warwick, Sheffield, King’s College London, Edinburgh and Durham. The 50% mark was reached when the University of York became the 77th UK university to divest.\nRevise, reuse, recycle: how to be a sustainable student\nRead more\nAs we celebrate this moment, we should also reflect on how it has taken us so long to get here. We should ask why globally important universities including Oxford and Cambridge still refuse to move their money out of all fossil fuels.\nDespite growing declarations of climate emergency, 50% of UK universities remain invested in the principle profiteers of the climate crisis. At a time when Australia burns in the bushfire crisis and climate deniers remain in positions of power across the globe, this lack of action is unforgivable.\nThe social licence of the fossil fuel industry has already been significantly damaged. We’ll now use this moment as a springboard to continue campaigning until the whole university sector has divested and the fossil fuel industry can no longer operate.\nThe need to keep up the pressure on these companies couldn’t be clearer. Indigenous and frontline communities are still fighting for their rights in response to the way these transnational corporations operate in their communities. The First Nations continue their decades-long resistance against tar sands expansion in Canada, while the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People in the Niger Delta are still fighting Shell’s business model which, we believe, causes dispossession and destruction across the region. Our solidarity with impacted communities is crucial.\n'The youth generation is united': the uni students striking for the climate\nRead more\nThe support for fossil fuel imperialism by the UK government underlines our imperative to act here too. In Argentina, bilateral trade agreements with the UK support the business ventures of companies like BP. Here, BP operates through its part-ownership of Pan American Energy (PAE) and is involved with the exploitation of Vaca Muerta, one of the world’s largest shale oil and gas reserves. Multinational oil companies are acting in violation of the rights of the Mapuche indigenous people, who have not given consent for the extraction that destroys their ancestral home to take place.\nThe government remains an active participant in the exploitative business models of oil companies overseas. This is particularly concerning at a time when new fossil fuel infrastructure needed to stop being built by 2017 to remain within the 1.5 degree parameter the Paris Agreement identified as a limit. As students and universities we can keep the pressure on by ensuring civil society is fully divested from the fossil fuel industry.\nUniversities are meant for the public good and so must lead the way in displaying how the UK takes responsibility for our actions in the world. They should be at the forefront of making the links between the struggles for climate justice and other social justice issues. The universities that have divested should use that commitment as a platform to intervene in the fight against land dispossession by fossil fuel companies and struggles against racist, forced deportations. At their roots are a system built on exploitation, dispossession, empire, imperialism and colonialism.\nThe fossil fuel industry and its partners in corporate crime will continue to increase their resistance to all those fighting it.

We need to have higher ambitions to lead the world in renewables – not just to drive down our own emissions but help other countries with theirs,” Allen said.\n“We have a diplomatic strength that should be used to help strengthen the global agenda on climate action.”\nThe self-styled modern Liberal MP Tim Wilson also endorsed Morrison’s comments, saying the commitment at the last election to “cut emissions, but not jobs” was a baseline for action.\n“The prime minister has rightly identified there’ll be more evolution of policy to cut emissions, but not jobs, and I look forward to contributing to that important evolution,” Wilson told Guardian Australia.\nDave Sharma, the MP for Malcolm Turnbull’s former seat of Wentworth, said he was “pleased to hear” Morrison’s comments on the importance of responding to climate change and promoted the government’s plan to “continue to evolve our policies with a view to reducing our emissions further”.\nQuick guide\nClimate change and bushfires\nShow\nDoes climate change cause bushfires?\nThe link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.\nWhat is the evidence on rising temperatures?\nThe Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.\nWhat other effects do carbon emissions have?\nDry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.\nSo is climate change making everything dryer?\nDryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.\nWhat do recent weather patterns show?\nThe year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.\nIs arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?\nNot a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.\nNSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.\nPhotograph: Regi Varghese/AAP\nWas this helpful?\nAustralian politics: subscribe by email\nRead more\nAnother moderate Liberal, Jason Falinski, said the party would continue to “drive responsible policy on climate change”.\n“We need practical and sensible policy here and seek ambitious action globally,” he said.\nBut as moderates welcomed the shift, conservative MPs were warning against a change in policy.\nThe Queensland Nationals MP Llew O’Brien told the Courier Mail that if Australia went beyond its current commitments, it would be “pure symbolism at the expense of the economy”.\nThe former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also issued a thinly veiled warning that the government risked a backlash in the bush if it moved to ramp up emission reduction targets.\n“To the person in the weatherboard and iron, the solution is not: you’ll lose your job and we’ll put up your power prices, because that is not a solution, that is another problem,” Joyce told Guardian Australia.\nJoyce said the royal commission into the bushfires needed to be “absolutely pragmatic” in its focus, looking at how to prevent a repeat of the crisis without straying to “global” issues.\n“If it goes off on a path of a macro global view, it will not ultimately bring people together, it will tear people apart,” he said.\nScott Morrison flags bushfires royal commission and says Coalition could bolster emissions reduction\nRead more\n“Global outcomes must be managed globally.”\nThe divide comes as Morrison insists the role of climate change is “not in dispute” within his ranks, despite several MPs denying the role of a warmer planet as an underlying cause of the severe bushfire season.\nThe Nationals MP George Christensen was the latest to promote his view that climate change was not a factor, telling his supporters on Facebook that climate change is not “a bogey man who can go around lighting bushfires”.\n“I post this because those who are politicising this tragedy by pushing their extreme green political agenda while the fires still burn absolutely disgust me,” he said.\nThe Liberal MP Craig Kelly last week caused a storm of controversy after appearing on UK television to argue that there was “no link” between climate change and Australia’s drought.\nFollowing the appearance, Morrison told his MPs that backbenchers should not do any international media interviews.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

But after Brexit, when the UK plans to copy EU rules, this will no longer be the case, making a UK-only limit harder to hit.\nMike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the car industry lobby group, said: “[Carmakers] will have to look at their model mix … you’ve got to see whether that’s economic. The fines are going to be severe and all of them will do everything they can to avoid that.\n“It could be that you see a reduction in consumer choice through the removal of higher-emitting vehicles from not just the top end, but particular segments.”\nWhile having to pull models from sale would be a blow to the car industry, the rules could prove to be environmentally effective if they reduce sales of the most polluting models. Cars account for just over 18% of UK emissions, according to government figures, and action in the transport sector is considered crucial to cutting emissions to 51% of 1990 levels by 2025 and to reach net zero by 2050.\nMel Evans, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Carmakers are not obliged to aggressively market heavy, polluting cars. They know that we are in a climate emergency and yet keep accelerating towards the cliff edge, because bigger, dirtier cars have higher profit margins. And because they use more petrol and diesel, the oil companies cash in as well.\n“To address the climate crisis, manufacturers need to U-turn on petrol and diesel, stop spending millions drumming up demand for their dirtiest cars, and focus on electric vehicles for a post-oil world.”\nThe carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold to British consumers rose for the third year in a row in 2019, underlining the scale of the challenge for the industry as it tries to meet the new EU limits.\nHowever, the prospect of an imminent Brexit at the end of January will force carmakers to make choices before the end of 2020, when the implementation period is scheduled to end and the UK-only limits kick in. That could include choosing to sell electric cars in the EU rather than the UK if they judge Europe to be a more important market.\nVolkswagen to hit 1m electric cars milestone two years early\nRead more\nCarmakers are rushing to bring to market new electric cars with zero exhaust emissions – including Volkswagen’s ID.3, Vauxhall’s Corsa-e and an electric Fiat 500 – this year, but production will initially be limited as factories gear up. At the same time, they are keen to hang on to their profitable but polluting sales of internal combustion engines.\nAdvertisement\nCarmakers breaching their individual CO2 targets will pay fines of €95 (£83) for every gram they are over their limit, multiplied by the number of cars sold that year. Average UK emissions were 127.9g a kilometre in 2019, the SMMT said, 35% above the 95g target for 2020 and 2021. The UK is planning to adopt the EU fine structure after Brexit.\nAl Bedwell, an analyst at the car consultancy LMC Automotive, said he expected some higher-polluting models to be withdrawn from sale across both the EU and the UK in the next two years. However, he said major efforts to increase sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) might not work in the absence of consumer demand.\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n“You can’t suddenly create a perfect environment to sell enough BEVs to make the problem go away,” he said.\nThe Department for Transport said: “Our priority is to protect everyone from unsafe vehicles, including those that are damaging our environment, which is why we continue to work with industry to improve the emissions standards of all vehicles.\n“We have set out bold plans for driving down CO2 emissions and committed in our ‘Road to Zero’ strategy to pursue vehicle emissions regulation that is at least as ambitious as the current arrangements as we leave the EU.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

It has obscured iconic views tourists flock to see. Far more than an aesthetic problem, it has forced business shutdowns, triggered health problems and kept children indoors for weeks.\nCity dwellers in south-east Australia have been forced to take a crash course in the finer points of air pollution. We’ve learned about the dangers of inhaling tiny PM2.5 particles (those 2.5 microns or fewer in diameter). We’ve learned that only a close-fitting P2 mask will do much to protect us.\nFashionable face masks: 'Trying to make something horrific seem appealing'\nRead more\nStill, we wear disposable paper masks and hold handkerchiefs to our faces, hoping any amount of filtering is helpful.\nEven for an historian of air pollution like me, this situation is a shock. It is not the first time Australia’s major cities have been shrouded in bushfire smoke. But the terrible air quality is unmatched in terms of severity, duration and extent.\nHistorically, air pollution from smoke was considered outside human control and not subject to regulation. But these bushfires are clearly linked to global warming, for which government, corporations and individuals are responsible. It’s time to rethink the way we protect air quality.\nThe history of smoke\nIn recent weeks, apps such as AirVisual have confirmed what we city dwellers can already see and smell: since the fires on the north coast of New South Wales began in late October, our air quality has plummeted.\nThe NSW government’s Air Quality Index data has shown that since late October, days when the index was higher than 100 – signalling exposure is unhealthy – have outnumbered clear days in Sydney, Newcastle and the Illawarra.\nIndex readings above 2,550 have been recorded in Sydney, while the Monash monitoring site in Canberra reached a choking 5,185 at 8pm on New Year’s Day.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nParliament House in Canberra surrounded by smoke haze in the early morning on 5 January 2020. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP\nBushfire smoke has affected the cities of NSW and the Australian Capital Territory in the past. In late January 1926, when Canberra was just emerging as a city, a thick haze of smoke sat over the site. Fires came within metres of Yarralumla, the residence which, the following year, would become home to the governor general.\nIn several years in the mid-1930s, bushfires burning to the north of Sydney left the city air thick with smoke. In October 1936, bushfire smoke forced a motor liner arriving from Hong Kong to warily enter the harbour sounding its siren, because it was invisible to signallers on South Head.\nA New Zealand pilot, flying into Sydney from Longreach the following month, had to fly blind in “great clouds of dense smoke” covering much of NSW. In 1939, Canberra was covered by what the visiting writer HG Wells described as a “streaming smoke curtain”.\nIn the summer of 1944, Sydney was again enveloped in a smoke haze, this time from fires in the Blue Mountains and (later Royal) national park in November. Photographs published at the time show the Sydney Harbour Bridge barely visible through dust and smoke at midday. The ongoing fires were blamed for an increase in diseases of the ears, nose and throat, and for cases of influenza and pneumonia, leading to a shortage of hospital beds.\nIn November 1951, all of NSW was said to be blacked out by bushfire smoke. In Sydney on the worst days, records show all four of the city’s airfields were closed because of “smoke-fog”.\nA hazy legal framework\nIn each of these episodes, bushfire smoke disrupted transport, commerce, health and the enjoyment of the urban environment. But even as other forms of air pollution began to be regulated, smoke from bushfires escaped legislative attention.\nWhat was understood as air pollution were the unwanted byproducts of industrial processes, whereas bushfire smoke was viewed as natural.\nIn NSW in 1866, an act based on British legislation restricted smoke from mills, distilleries and gas works. Further limitations on smoke production in built-up areas were included in later acts governing public health (1902), motor traffic (1909) and local government (1919).\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nBeachgoers stand on a cliff as smoke haze from bushfires blankets the Sydney CBD on 21 December 2019. Photograph: Steven Saphore/AAP\nAfter the second world war Newcastle, the site of the country’s largest concentration of coal-burning heavy industry, began to pay closer attention to managing air quality. This pioneering work was given added urgency after 4,000 people died in heavy London smog in 1952.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nIn 1958, a NSW parliamentary committee delivered a report into smoke abatement. It did not mention recent issues with bushfire smoke, and also dismissed the impact of domestically produced smoke. The subsequent 1961 Clean Air Act focused on air pollution from industry, transport and power generation.\nAir pollution legislation continued to evolve in following decades, targeting motor vehicle emissions in the 1970s, backyard burning of waste in the 1980s, and wood fires used to heat homes in the 1990s.\nThese measures have been successful. A 2006 study found that between 1998 and 2003, on the limited occasions when standards for PM10 in six Australian cities were exceeded, the main sources were not industry or transport, but dust storms and bushfires (with the exception of Launceston, where heating fires were the main contributor).\nLooking ahead\nToday, bushfire smoke is excluded from air quality regulations, despite its obvious role in pollution. It is still considered natural and beyond human control.\nHowever, the link between the current fires and human-caused climate change, long predicted by climate scientists, suggests this exemption is no longer valid.\nExplainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?\nRead more\nAs the Australian National University’s Tom Griffiths has written, the current fires in some ways repeat patterns of the past. But “the smoke is worse, more widespread and more enduring”.\nWhen Australia begins the recovery from these fires, our business-as-usual approach requires a rethink. Measures to protect air quality should be a major part of this.\nIt is time that corporations, governments and societies which contribute to global heating be held to account for more frequent, intense and widespread bushfires, and the smoke which billows from them.\nNancy Cushing is an associate professor at the University of Newcastle\nThis piece was originally published in the Conversation\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Siemens says it is one of the first companies to have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe decision on the contract, reportedly worth $30m, comes as Australia is in the grip of an unprecedented bushfire crisis that has claimed at least 27 lives, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and likely pushed several species towards extinction, scorching millions of hectares of unique habitat and killing more than a billion animals.\nExplaining his decision, Kaeser said he was assured by a December 2019 letter from Resources Minister Matt Canavan that the mine, in Queensland’s Galilee Basin, had passed all legal obstacles.\nCanavan wrote to Kaeser in December with a plea “not to be intimidated by the noisy anti-coal minority targeting the Adani Carmichael mine project and companies providing services to it.”\nHe wrote: “If the protestors achieve their goals of ending coalmining by bullying companies into submission, the result would be millions more people without a home, without access to electricity and without as much hope as they otherwise could have.”\nIn the statement, he said the project was also “approved” by the indigenous Wangan and Jagalingou people which was “very important to us”.\nThat approval is strongly disputed by a group of Wangan and Jagalingou people. Adani took court action to prevent that group, led by Adrian Burragubba, from setting up camp on the land.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nThe Queensland Government in 2019 extinguished native title over Wangan and Jagalingou to enable the mining project to proceed.\nKaeser said he was personally “moved” by messages from Australians who had “described that their homes and their country is burning and suffering from these terrible fires”.\nThe Adani coalmine will extract an initial 10m tonnes of thermal coal per year from a site 300km inland and transport it along a railway line to Adani’s Abbot Point Port for export.\nKaeser said there were competitors to the railway signalling contract the company signed on 10 December 2019, which meant “whether or not Siemens provides the signaling, the project will still go ahead”.\nLast week Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said Siemens had “the power to stop, delay or at least interrupt the building of the huge Adani coalmine in Australia” and people should push the company “to make the only right decision”.\nGovernment to commit $50m for wildlife affected by bushfires as green groups call for action\nRead more\nGreens leader Richard Di Natale had also written to Siemens, and warned the company risked “reputational damage” over the deal.\nGalilee Blockade spokesperson Ben Pennings said: “Siemens has just trashed their billion dollar reputation for a $30m contract. Their reckless indifference to the suffering of Australians will be judged harshly, now and in the history books.”\n“Siemens’ expertise is vital to the Adani coal railway and there is too much at stake to give up. Citizens will escalate their protests until Siemens listens to the science and choose the right side of history.\n“Adani will never have social licence to build a new thermal coalmine in Australia. Our challenge is to turn this discontent into civil disobedience powerful enough to overcome any government repression.”\nAustralian Conservation Foundation senior campaigner Christian Slattery said the Siemens announcement, “while bushfires rage in Australia, is nothing short of shameful”.\nHe said: “The company has shown its true colours with this decision. It has a climate change policy, but it is hollow and empty. Sadly, Siemens has shown it is no better than the fossil fuel companies it works with.”\nThe Galilee Basin has been identified as one of the largest untapped sources of coal in the world, and campaigners and scientists have warned the Adani mine will open the way to several other coal mining projects in the region.\nSlattery added: “If constructed, the infrastructure for Adani’s mine will open the Galilee Basin to one of the largest expansions of thermal coal mining on the planet.\n“Siemens claims to support the Paris Agreement, but now it is committed to work on one of the world’s biggest carbon bombs.”\n“The unfolding bushfire crisis in Australia, which has killed at least 28 people and more than one billion native animals is a terrifying foretaste of the climate change future if more coal mines are dug.”\nAn Adani spokesperson said: “We are pleased to be working with Siemens as the company is known for its exceptional experience in building rail signalling infrastructure around the world.\n“With construction of the Carmichael Project well and truly under way we have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to regional Queenslanders, Australians and people in developing nations who desperately need affordable energy to help lift them out of poverty.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The New Zealand scheme, which will be offered to all schools that teach 11 to 15 year-old students, will not be compulsory, the government said.\n“One of the pieces of feedback we’ve got from teachers around the country is that they’re really crying out for something like this, because kids are already in the conversation about climate change,” said James Shaw, New Zealand’s climate change minister and co-leader of the left-leaning Green Party.\nNew Zealand has its fourth-warmest year on record\nRead more\n“They’re seeing stuff on social media on a daily basis and none of it’s good news, and the sense of powerlessness that comes from that is extremely distressing.”\nHundreds of thousands of school and university students around the world, including in New Zealand, walked out of their classes for a series of climate strikes during 2019, a year when scientists warned that climate change was an “existential threat to civilisation”.\nYoung people feel betrayed and abandoned by older generations over their lack of action on the climate issue, and worry about it has increasingly sparked anxiety and depression, a group of British psychologists warned in September.\nPlay Video\n15:08\nInside the mission to create an army of Greta Thunbergs – video\nAdvertisement\nA pilot of the New Zealand scheme, which ran in one school in the city of Christchurch in 2018, had led to the introduction of materials for the national roll-out that helped students process their emotions about the climate issue, Shaw told The Guardian.\n“Being in the conversation itself causes stress,” he said. By necessity, he added, students would “delve into the bad news” of the science explaining the climate crisis.

Since then at least 27 people have lost their lives, millions of animals have died and the navy has been called in to evacuate beaches. The devastating impacts of climate change are tragically becoming real for many. And many, from bushfire survivors to business leaders to firefighters, are calling for action.\nAs a result, we are in a moment where the opportunity to implement effective and long-lasting policy to lower Australia’s climate pollution could finally be within reach. Indeed, the independent MP Zali Steggall has announced her intention to introduce a climate bill into federal parliament in March. Meanwhile the New South Wales energy minister, Matt Kean, has asked the state’s chief scientist to identify opportunities for NSW to lead on climate action. Even the NSW Young Liberals have put forward a plan to act on climate.\nTo grasp this opportunity we must learn critical lessons from the past.\nScott Morrison suffers blow to personal approval rating in first poll of 2020\nRead more\nThis is not the first time that public support for climate action has been sky high, nor the first time that political opportunity for far-reaching policy has presented itself. In 2007 Kevin Rudd was elected with a huge mandate to act on climate. In 2011 the Gillard government, with support of the crossbench, implemented the extremely effective clean energy future package. And last year people across the country worked tirelessly to make the federal election a climate election.\nIn all three of these cases, we lost in the how – how should Australia go about acting on climate?\nIn the first instance, we lost momentum for action because we could not agree on the effectiveness of a policy – would the carbon pollution reduction scheme with its 5% emissions reduction target be a springboard for further action, or lock in rights to pollute for our biggest emitters?\nIn the second case, climate deniers such as Tony Abbott weaponised the carbon price policy for political ends, running the extremely effective “Axe the tax” scare campaign. Furthermore, the carbon price was for many Australians an abstract policy idea disconnected from their lives but perceived to be hurting their hip pockets.\nIn the third, a poll by the Australia Institute found that there was simply not enough awareness of the differences between the two main parties’ energy and climate policies. With renewable energy booming, the federal Coalition was able to paint itself has having a reasonable and sensible climate policy, even though it has anything but.\nI raise these painful moments in history not to rehash the past but rather to see what we can learn for the future. Because we need to recognise that from public policy and political perspective, climate change is hard – the causes (burning fossil fuels and reducing carbon sinks) are distant from the impacts geographically and temporarily. Its solutions practically are many and the policies needed often complex.\nNot to mention the fact that Australia has a powerful fossil fuel lobby and, in each of these moments, it took advantage of the disagreement, disconnection and lack of understanding to good effect.\nLooking forward, we are now presented with both a policy challenge and communications challenges.\nFirst, can those who care about climate unite behind practical solutions and policy options that will be:\neffective at lowering emissions;\nconnect with real people’s lives; and\nare easy and compelling for the average person to understand?\nSecond, can we communicate a set of success measures against which everyday Australians can judge the effectiveness of a policy or a government on climate?\nI propose five tests or questions that could help us meet these policy and communications challenges:\nIs carbon pollution going down in real terms?\nCan the government point to real-world action and policies that are being implemented now, this year, to lower emissions that are commensurate with the scale of the problem?\nDoes the government have a plan to fully decarbonise every sector of the economy – electricity, transport, industry, buildings, agriculture and land use? And ones that address the biggest opportunities and threats, for example a renewable export plan and a bushfire plan?\nDo these plans deliver co-benefits in each sector that make people’s lives better? For example, creating new jobs, new industries, healthier and more liveable? homes, less traffic congestion, lower electricity bills and less air pollution.\nIs the government or policy reducing and removing support for fossil fuels and/or other causes of climate change?\nAdvertisement\nIf the answer is no to these questions, the policy isn’t working, the government isn’t acting on climate, it’s unlikely to be popular and thus long-lasting and it isn’t fulfilling our obligations under the Paris agreement.\nThe basic idea that underpins these tests is that actually to address climate change we need a plan, or in reality multiple plans.\nExplainer: what are the underlying causes of Australia's shocking bushfire season?\nRead more\nFor too long, climate policy insiders and commentators have been obsessed with carbon pricing. Carbon prices, like other policies can be well designed and effective, or badly designed and ineffective. But whether a carbon price is well designed or not, it’s only one tool in the policy toolkit for decarbonising Australia. Other tools include regulatory changes, investment in research and development, new standards, support for new markets and so forth. A plan is needed for each sector of the Australian economy that brings together these different policy levers or tools and different actors to do the hard work of decarbonisation. Work, that the climate science says is urgently required but, if done right, could lead to a better, more prosperous Australia.\nThe good news is we are starting to see different organisations calling for a plan. For example, WWF-Australia is calling for a climate plan and have done the research needed to communicate it to mainstream Australia. Farmers for Climate Action are calling for the development of a climate and agriculture strategy. The Climate and Health Alliance is advocating for a climate and health plan. While, Renew, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Energy Efficiency Council and many others are working on a plan for existing buildings that is starting to gain traction. The good news is all of these organisations are building diverse coalitions, talking about the non-environmental benefits that can be delivered by acting on climate in their respective sectors.\nAustralian’s trust in its political leadership is at an all-time low, perhaps this is a moment that leaders across all states and territories to redeem our faith in politics and end the climate wars, with the humble task of drawing up a plan.\nNicky Ison is the energy transition manager at WWF-Australia and a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The review was set to report back in August this year, but is currently without a leader and the clock is ticking.\nThe criticism that prompted the review focused around three key themes: first, that the way the strategy is applied fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background; second, its effectiveness (the last set of official figures revealed that still only one in 10 of referrals goes on to receive specialist support); and finally, that it inhibits legitimate expression.\nThe last point is particularly pertinent given the fact that Extinction Rebellion and the environmental issues for which it campaigns were included on a list of “extremist ideologies”, which was then sent out to public sector partners, including teachers, who are under a legal obligation to refer the slightest suspicion that a person is vulnerable to said ideologies.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAmong evidence that a person may be vulnerable to Extinction Rebellion’s alleged extremist beliefs was speaking in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution”. Given the growing awareness of the climate emergency across the world – arguably due in part to the actions of Extinction Rebellion – this would make hundreds of thousands of people extremists.\nSchool strikers were singled out in the guidance – last year thousands of UK pupils, and millions worldwide, walked out of school in protest at government inaction on the climate crisis. The activist Greta Thunberg is a leading proponent of school strikes.\nThis would have placed teachers – obliged to refer under the statutory duty, perhaps the most controversial element of the Prevent programme – under further pressure. The education sector is already the greatest single source of referrals to Prevent.\nCounter-terror police have been at pains to emphasise that Extinction Rebellion are not considered to be extremists and that the document was drawn up in error. Action has been taken to recall the document, but only after police were approached by the Guardian. It is also likely that the document, dated November last year, has been in circulation for around two months, and police chiefs are unable to say how many individuals and organisations received it.\nBut there has already been at least one publicised case of an individual being referred to Prevent over their associations with Extinction Rebellion – Lyn Jenkins, a 69-year-old retired doctor, was referred by his NHS trust after telling them he wanted to be arrested during Extinction Rebellion protests.\nPrevent practitioners within police forces log every Prevent referral on a giant case management database – a database that the police insist was not a secret before the Guardian covered it last year, despite revealing that they do not inform individuals they are being listed on the database, pointing critics to a handful of buried references in highly obscure civil service documents online.\nFor those concerned that they may have been referred to Prevent for their fears – and actions taken to address them – over the climate emergency, individuals are able to contact their relevant police force, ask if their details are held on the Prevent case management database, and then request that they be removed.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Our second hottest year was 2013, followed by 2005, 2018 and 2017.\nNew South Wales – one state hard hit by the bushfires – broke its record by a greater margin, with temperatures 1.95C above average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C.\nAt a very basic level, rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere change the Earth’s radiation balance, allowing less heat to escape.\nAustralia also had its driest ever year in 2019, with rainfall 40% lower than average, based on records going back to 1900. NSW also had its driest year.\nAdvertisement\nA visualisation from Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, examines hot and dry years in Australia since 1910 and how they correlate with major bushfires.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAn animated history of average maximum temperatures and rainfall in Australia since 1910.\nFire authorities and the Bureau of Meteorology look at the risk of bushfires using the forest fire danger index, a combined measure of temperature, humidity, wind speed and the dryness, but not the amount, of fuel on the ground.\nAustralia’s 2019 spring months of September, October and November were the worst on a record going back to 1950 for bushfire risk.\nWhat about ‘natural’ weather patterns?\nThere have been two other meteorological patterns that helped generate the extreme conditions Australia has been experiencing, and both these “modes of variability” were in “phases” that made conditions worse.\nAdvertisement\nThe Indian Ocean dipole was in a “positive phase”, meaning the Indian Ocean off Australia’s north-west was cooler than normal and the west of the ocean was warmer.\nPositive dipole events draw moisture away from Australia and tend to deliver less rainfall.\nBut there is evidence that the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are also impacting the dipole and another phenomenon, known as the southern annular mode (SAM).\nA 2009 study found that positive dipole events “precondition” the south of the country for dangerous bushfire seasons and that these events were becoming more common.\nA 2018 study in the journal Nature Communications found the number of extreme positive dipole events goes up as climate heating continues.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAt 1.5C of global warming, the frequency of extreme positive dipole events doubles compared with the pre-industrial period.\nThe southern annular mode was in a “negative phase” as the bushfires took hold in November and December. This phase was generated by a sudden warming event in the stratosphere above Antarctica.\nThis caused westerly winds to track further north, blowing hot air across the continent into fire-prone areas, further fanning flames.\nAbram’s own research has found that the SAM is being pushed towards more positive phases which, when they occur in Australia’s winter, tend to dry the continent.\nAdvertisement\nProf Matt England, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, said: “These modes of variability are not changing in a way that’s good for south-east Australia.\n“We know with certainty that we are stacking the dice for the chances of these extreme drought years because of the changes in the modes.”\nWhat has happened to Australia’s fire weather?\nScientists have already detected a trend towards more dangerous fire weather in Australia.\nA 2017 study of 67 years of FFDI data found a “clear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season”.\nThat trend continued in 2019, which was the riskiest year for bushfires on a record going back to 1950.\nWhat role is climate change playing in the risk of fire?\nA study of Queensland’s historic 2018 bushfire season found the extreme temperatures that coincided with the fires were four times more likely because of human-caused climate change.\nIn advice issued in November 2019, Australia’s National Environmental Science Program was unambiguous.\n“Human-caused climate change has resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia.\n“Observations show a trend towards more dangerous conditions during summer and an earlier start to the fire season, particularly in parts of southern and eastern Australia.\n“These trends are very likely to increase into the future, with climate models showing more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires throughout Australia due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.”\nDespite such unequivocal statements, Scott Morrison has been irritated that interviewers have asked about his government’s record on climate change, saying it was “just ridiculous” to link “any one emissions reduction policy to any of these fires”.\nMorrison’s argument that no emissions reduction policy can be tied to individual events is spurious, as the same argument could be put for any and all efforts to reduce emissions anywhere in the world, at any time.\nScientists also believe that 2019 was a “standout” year in Australia for the formation of extreme bushfires that became “coupled” with the atmosphere, generating their own lightning and gusty, violent and unpredictable winds. Rainfall is replaced with blackened hail and embers that can be shot out over distances of 30km.\nScott Morrison looks for wriggle room on climate as he detects the whiff of backlash\nSarah Martin\nRead more\nAdvertisement\nAnother study has found that global heating will create more favourable conditions for these “pyroCB” storms to form in Australia.\nWhat about the future?\nClimate studies show that conditions in Australia for extreme bushfires will only get worse as more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere.\nOn Friday afternoon the president of the Australian Academy of Science, Prof John Shine, said Australia would need to further improve its climate modelling ability and understanding of fire behaviour to mitigate against the extreme events that would become more frequent and intense because of climate change.\n“Australia must take stronger action as part of the worldwide commitment to limit global warming to 1.5° C above the long-term average to reduce the worst impacts of climate change,” he said.\nEngland said: “We are loading the dice for more and more of these summers. But we have had knowledge of this for some time.\n“What we have seen in Australia this year will just be a normal summer if we warmed the planet by 3C. And an extreme summer would be even worse than we’ve seen now.”\nAbram said: “Even from my perspective, I am surprised by just how bad 1C of warming is looking.\n“It’s worrying that we are talking about this as a new normal, because we are actually on an upward trajectory. Currently the pledges in the Paris agreement are not enough to limit us to 1.5C – we are looking more like 3C.”\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

On net, emissions are slightly higher than in the beginning of 2017, when Trump’s administration began enacting dozens of environment rollbacks aimed at helping the oil and gas industry.\nTrump is still working to further weaken bedrock standards. This week he proposed to allow major projects like pipelines and highways to bypass reviews of how they will contribute to global warming. The draft rule is unlikely to become final before the November election, but it is yet another reason industries weighing climate choices might delay significant action.\nAdvertisement\n“What they have done is created confusion within the business community and the environmental world as to what are going to be the standards,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under the Republican president George W Bush. “Essentially every regulation the agency promulgates gets a lawsuit that goes with it, almost inevitably … that’s the only good thing you can say about it.”\nWhitman called the approach “mindless” and said “whoever is a bigger donor gets to tell them what the environmental policy should be, it seems”.\nIn the absence of any federal climate action, states, cities and businesses have pledged their own efforts, seeking to encourage other big emitters like China and India to continue to slow their growing climate pollution.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nAndrew Light, a climate negotiator for President Barack Obama’s state department, said the world is taking note of those efforts, but if Trump is re-elected “you are going to see a lot of people who are worried anew about what the US can do”.\nAmericans choosing Trump would send the signal that they don’t care about the climate, Light said.\nAmerica’s Pledge, a project to quantify ongoing US emissions reductions, estimates that non-federal actors – like states and cities – could cut climate pollution 37% below 2005 levels by 2030. A Democrat in the White House could increase that to 49% with what Light described as modest, politically achievable policy changes. Experts are increasingly calling for the US to halve its emissions by 2030 and neutralize them by 2050.\n“In the case of a second Trump term, we’ve got to totally double down on the efforts to communicate how serious the non-federal actors are in the United States,” Light said. “And what you really want to try to make sure is that those people in other countries who are not in favor of strengthening their countries’ own climate target are not able to point to the United States and say nothing’s going on there.”\nThe Trump administration has initiated essentially all of its planned climate rollbacks – from weakening standards for cars to go farther on less gasoline to erasing rules for power companies to shift away from coal. It would be able to defend those changes in court against environment advocates and Democratic states if the president wins election.\n“The biggest impact of a second term of a Trump administration would just be more lost time,” said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group. “It would be more time in which emissions weren’t really declining when they really needed to be.”\nThe concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases is at a record high, according to a report from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization. The planet is already 1C hotter than it was before industrialization.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nA train of loaded coal cars heads to the Oak Creek power plant in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, earlier this month. Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA\nThree-quarters of the commitments made by countries under the international Paris agreement are “totally inadequate”, according to a comprehensive expert analysis. Temperatures are still rising and the world is “gravely” unprepared for disasters, crop failures, coastal flooding and heatwaves, according to another review.\nUnder Trump, the oil and gas industry contributing heavily to the climate crisis is thriving. Oil and gas-related industries in the US are planning to build 157 new or expanded plants and expand drilling over the next five years – releasing as much greenhouse gas pollution as 50 new coal-fired power plants, according to a report from the Environmental Integrity Project.\nAs the technology for retrieving oil and gas has advanced, with hydraulic fracturing, the cost of production has plummeted. The US is now a net exporter of oil products.\nMuch of the expansion expected would be for feedstocks to make chemicals and plastics, explained Courtney Bernhardt, the group’s research director.\nBernhardt said the oil and gas expansion would erase about 75% of the progress in the power sector since 2012.\n“The US is already struggling to meet climate commitments and transition to a low-carbon future,” Bernhardt said. “This analysis shows that we’re heading in the wrong direction and really need to slow emissions growth from the oil, gas and petrochemical industries.”\nIt’s not just climate change that is getting worse. Trump has loosened rules for clean water and air and safer chemicals. Air quality is already eroding, linked with 10,000 additional US deaths over two years.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are offering a starkly different future for the environment. The House energy and commerce committee last week introduced a discussion draft of legislation for the US to achieve a “100% clean economy” by 2050.\nIn the race against Trump, all the major Democratic candidates have similarly pledged to seek at least net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe League of Conservation Voters’ called the House committee effort encouraging and said the announcement “is further proof that elections have consequences”.

Morrison’s message for you is he plans to “go further” on emissions reduction.\nQuick guide\nClimate change and bushfires\nShow\nDoes climate change cause bushfires?\nThe link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.\nWhat is the evidence on rising temperatures?\nThe Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.\nWhat other effects do carbon emissions have?\nDry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.\nSo is climate change making everything dryer?\nDryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.\nWhat do recent weather patterns show?\nThe year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.\nIs arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?\nNot a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.\nNSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.\nPhotograph: Regi Varghese/AAP\nWas this helpful?\nMorrison’s allegiance to the party’s centre-right faction has given him more rhetorical flexibility in his response to climate change than conservative MPs ever allowed his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull.\nAdvertisement\nBut conservatives will become suspicious – and unruly – if the man they believe to be one of their own actually wants to back up this latest change in rhetoric with action or substantial policy change.\nOn the other flank of the party, there is an emerging view – from a clutch of at least a dozen MPs – that climate anxiety can no longer be ignored. These MPs will be demanding more.\nModerates are hoping that Sunday’s rhetorical shift is the first sign of a pivot – that of a pragmatic prime minister attempting to turn around the Queen Mary.\nBut conservatives will be hoping that Morrison is all talk, no action.\nScott Morrison flags bushfires royal commission and says Coalition could bolster emissions reduction\nRead more\nMorrison has been attempting to paper over the cracks within his partyroom by insisting that there is “no dispute” within the coalition that climate change is linked to the bushfire crisis, despite abundant evidence to the contrary.\nIt was no accident that Morrison told his MPs last week in a phone hook-up to shut their collective trap on climate change policy until after the fires abated.\nClimate change policy has dogged the conservative side of politics for more than a decade, and there is no reason to expect that Morrison will be left off the hook.\nBut he is not Tony Abbott, and nor is he Malcolm Turnbull; he carries none of the ideological baggage of his predecessors. This could prove a great strength for Morrison as he seeks to navigate a new policy path through such politically dangerous territory.\nShifting course is, as the prime minister said on Sunday, “a challenging task”.\nBut it’s now clear that the status quo is untenable.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Roger, do you support them?” Lawyers for the activists, mostly students, said they were appealing the fine of £17,000 (21,600 Swiss francs / $AU32,000) on the basis they were acting as whistleblowers for the climate emergency.

Others baselessly claim Islamic State is instructing its followers to wage war on the country with fire, that Chinese billionaires are using lasers to clear the path for new cities, or that eco-terrorists are trying to spur action on climate change by manufacturing a catastrophe.\nAccompanying these laughable mistruths, though, are more dangerous distortions.\nThey are the ones being used to deflect from climate change’s role in creating longer, more severe fire seasons.\nTwo pieces of disinformation stand out from the rest: that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush.\nAustralia is built on lies, so why would we be surprised about lies about climate change?\nLuke Pearson for IndigenousX\nRead more\nDisinformation has spread across social media, finding its way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.\nEsteemed climate change expert professor Will Steffen, a member of Australia’s Climate Council and the inaugural director of Australian National University’s Climate Change Institute, is concerned at how disinformation has spread with such ease.\nAdvertisement\n“In my mind, I think it’s a serious issue and it is potentially very dangerous,” Steffen told the Guardian. “That’s because the bushfire situation is very dangerous … the evidence is overwhelming that climate change is playing a prominent role in worsening bushfire conditions across Australia.\n“People who are for whatever reason trying to put out false or extremely misleading information are actually doing a huge disservice to the risk to human life in the future, the risk to property, the risk to the natural world, and indeed the risk to economy.”\nDigital rights experts say the disinformation is yet more evidence that social media platforms are failing in their duty to act responsibly.\n“We need to see social media platforms playing a greater role in responding to the disinformation being shared on their platforms about the bushfires,” Digital Rights Watch chair Tim Singleton Norton said.\n“This needs to happen in tandem with effective government oversight, transparency, and accountability measures, as well as public education campaigns that give people the tools to identify misinformation.”\nHazard reduction is absolutely an important factor when it comes to fire management ... but it is not the panacea\nShane Fitzsimmons\nThere are nuggets of truth in some of the disinformation.\nArson has always been a serious problem in Australia, particularly at times of heightened fire danger. Arsonists have been responsible for some of Australia’s worst bushfires, including a blaze during the horrific 2009 Black Saturday fires that killed 10 people, and arson is a common cause of ignition. New South Wales police say they have charged 24 people for lighting bushfires since November.\nThis time around, though, the role of arson has been grossly exaggerated. Suggestions of an arson epidemic began to ferment on social media at the height of the crisis around New Year’s Day. On Twitter, much of the disinformation centred around the #arsonemergency hashtag.\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\nRead more\nQueensland University of Technology senior lecturer Timothy Graham, an expert in social media analysis, took a sample of tweets from the hashtag and analysed them for characteristics typically associated with bots and trolls. His findings suggested a clear “disinformation campaign”.\n“Australia suddenly appears to be getting swamped by mis/disinformation as a result of this environmental catastrophe, and we are suffering the consequences in terms of hyped up polarisation and an increased difficulty and inability for citizens to discern truth,” Graham told the Guardian.\nClaims of an arson emergency were spurred along by some mainstream outlets. Channel 7, a major commercial television network, tweeted that police were “now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season”.\nThe tweet neither reflected what police had said or what Channel 7 had itself reported in its news story.\nA story in the Murdoch-owned national broadsheet, The Australian, also falsely claimed that 183 arsonists had been arrested in the “current bushfire season”. That piece also went global. It was tweeted by Donald Trump Jr and followed up by InfoWars, a right-wing US website, which stated: “Authorities in Australia have arrested close to 200 people for deliberately starting the bushfires that have devastated the country, yet the media and celebrities continue to blame ‘climate change’ for the disaster.”\nThe number was a gross exaggeration. It was arrived at by counting a range of bushfire-related offences other than arson – including contraventions of fire bans, for example – and used annual figures, not those for the current fire season, which began in September. The Australian subsequently updated its story.\nNSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer.\nSomething else is out of control in Australia: climate disaster denialism\nKetan Joshi\nRead more\nThe RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. That claim was running hot on social media, and was given credibility by figures like federal Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce, a prominent Australian politician, who said “green caveats” were stopping firefighters from reducing fuel loads.\nThis is at complete odds with statements by the RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, who said the single biggest barrier to hazard reduction is the increasingly hot and dry weather and the “shrinking window of opportunity” within which managed burns could safely take place.\nAdvertisement\nFitzsimmons said hazard reduction is also of little utility in fires as intense as those experienced in NSW this season.\n“Hazard reduction is absolutely an important factor when it comes to fire management and managing fire in the landscape but it is not the panacea,” Fitzsimmons said on Wednesday.\nComments like Fitzsimmons’ have done little to stop the idea taking hold. Prime minister Scott Morrison has nominated the lack of hazard reduction work as a key issue he wants to investigate after the current crisis.\nAt the same time, Morrison has demonstrated little appetite for strengthening climate action.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

Fire is, and always has been, part of the interwoven matrix of the relationships between people and the physical and spiritual world. The smell of smoke is expected to be in the air for half the year.\nBehind this is a worldview where the land and sea and everything within it are to be respected and cared for, which is where our popular slogan of “caring for country” came from.\nWe don’t see fire as a bad phenomenon, but it surely can be if it isn’t respected and used properly.\nIf you were to observe global emissions from fires over the past 10 years, many occur each year in northern, western and central Australia, where Indigenous people have regained their authority to “reignite” their country. It’s where western scientists have come to understand that fire is ecologically inevitable and necessary. Having Indigenous landowners burn it will lessen the large conflagrations that consume all in their path, the sort of fires we have sadly seen in recent weeks in south-east Australia (fires that I estimate to have burned considerably less territory than burns in northern Australia annually).\nOrthodox views about Australia’s environment and its management no longer work and rapid adaptation is required – using lessons learnt by First Australians. No longer do the seasons of summer, autumn, winter and spring align with the calendar as they did a decade ago, nor do the wet and dry seasons of northern Australia.\nFor First Nations people the bushfires bring a particular grief, burning what makes us who we are\nLorena Allam\nRead more\nThe seasons in Australia should be defined by changes that occur in our environment, the prevailing winds and astronomy, as Indigenous people did.\nCurrently, responses to managing fire are largely built around events in the calendar. By contrast, Indigenous knowledge and management is responsive to the changes in the country, regardless of the month; changes that in many places signal actions needing to be taken.\nFor example, on Wardaman country west of Katherine in the Northern Territory, it’s now coming into Yijilg, when the heavy rainfall arrives after a long build-up, with lighter rains during the season Ngarruwun (heat and build-up storms). The descriptions of the seasons are triggered by events occurring in the landscape and weather, not by the date.\nAs fire is such a big part of our lives, that too is informed by the biota and weather. In western Arnhem Land, dryer cool air, combined with morning fog and flowering of the Woolybutt (Eucalyptus miniata) signal Yekke season. This is the time to light small “cool” fires to create a mosaic throughout the landscape that breaks up the country, reducing large hot fires later in the year.\nThis allows people to walk through country, and provides refuge for animals. The way Indigenous seasons are defined and the way our actions respond to changes in country allow for management that is locally relevant and involves a spiritual element, as well as physical and mental. Being able to walk through country is a significant indicator.\nIndicator species for fire would be apparent for southern Australia, even within these modified landscapes. These indicators need to be reinvigorated and brought back into knowledge through the active participation and guidance of Indigenous people.\nAnimals adapt to fire and some get involved. Karrakayn, the brown falcon, gets actively involved in fire by picking up embers and moving them around to spread the fire so that it can hunt, just like Indigenous people. I wonder how many of the millions of animals killed in the current bushfires have ever seen or interacted with fire, making it almost impossible for them to respond to bushfires.\nPeople need to see and understand that an unburnt country is not “wilderness” and how country should be – but country desperately calling for fire to rejuvenate it and restore the balance of risks. Not uncontrolled damaging fires, but fires that are understood, planned, patchy and regular – the fires of 1788 are informative.\nIndigenous Australians have been the guardians of their territories for a very, very long time – there is clear evidence suggesting a period of occupation of at least 65,000 years. It’s time the nation adopted an approach that embraced the knowledge, wisdoms and traditions of the people who had lived here sustainably for millennia.\nMost conservatives know prevention is better than cure – except when it comes to climate change\nRichard Denniss\nRead more\nThere is a need to shift the way we collectively act and think in Australia, as well as in other parts of the world.\nWe require economies to have responsive mechanisms to deal with the way the world is changing – less rainfall in parts, longer fire seasons, rising sea levels and less freshwater runoff – but we have to live with our environment, not against it.\nSavanna burning, local capacity, authority and control – hard-earned lessons from the north can provide immense opportunity in the south, aligning policy with employment and enterprise to bring benefit to Indigenous, local and regional communities, and shift the way lands are used and the economy works. There are profound opportunities right now.\nAdvertisement\nIs yearly burning so incomprehensible? Cool, patchy burns that reduce fuel and prevent the likelihood of large-scale burning. The cost would be offset by the benefits to country, people and the global community. We cannot afford to lose more lives, jeopardise our health, lose our wildlife and spend billions repairing the avoidable loss of productivity and life.\nIndigenous people comprise 3% of the population but have unmatched and untapped capital to bring to any future discussions and actions relating to the future of living in Australia.\nThe time for action is now.

If we do, Australia will become a leader in the fight against global warming. And we can do it.\nThe cheapest new generation is from wind and solar. And every year they are getting cheaper. That is a fact. But they depend on the wind blowing or the sun shining. That’s why it is called variable renewable energy.\nSo we have to plan to store the energy when it is abundant so that supply is maintained when it is not.\nHave we now reached the point where at last our response to global warming will be driven by engineering and economics rather than ideology and idiocy?\nThis is why I prioritised pumped hydro when I was prime minister and started the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and the Hydro Tasmania “battery of the nation”. Apart from pumped hydro, there are other storage opportunities including batteries and using renewable energy to make “green” hydrogen, itself a fuel, which brings with it huge export opportunities as well.\nBut the bottom line is that today in Australia we have the means to decarbonise our entire electricity sector. At the same time we electrify the economy such as by moving to electric vehicles and trucks and using electricity, rather than gas, for heating.\nWe need to plan this carefully – we have to keep energy affordable and reliable as we make the transition. My government’s policy for a national energy guarantee (Neg) integrated emissions reduction and reliability, and would have enabled us to continue to make the switch to renewables without compromising the reliability of the electricity network.\nAustralia bushfires: second Victorian firefighter dies bringing state's death toll to four\nRead more\nToday we need common purpose, leadership and planning. We can demonstrate that abundant zero emission energy will create thousands of new jobs that will vastly exceed those lost as coal burning comes to an end.\nTake the Hunter Valley. It has enormous transmission capacity which need not be wasted as its coal-fired generators close. The degraded landscape of old mines could be covered with solar panels. Pumped hydro can be created, including around Glenbawn Dam. And that is only one form of storage. The Hunter could become a green energy hub.\nThe children in Muswellbrook and Singleton will not have to breathe in coal dust and sulphur dioxide from the mines and power stations, and their parents will have jobs in industries that thrive with cheap, green power.\nPlanning is essential. A practical reality is that it takes much less time to construct new solar or windfarms than it does large-scale pumped hydro for storage. And so we have to plan the storage now.\nAs we replace big centralised coal-burning generators with many more distributed renewable generators, we will need more and differently designed transmission. A more distributed generation system creates resilience in the face of natural disaster with fewer single points of failure.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison while visiting damaged property on Stokes Bay on Kangaroo Island. Photograph: David Mariuz/AAP\nAnd those concerned about fuel security would recognise that the most reliable strategy is to use less imported fuels. Far from threatening the Australian weekend, electric vehicles make Australia more energy independent and thus secure.\nBut above all we have to face this fact; coal is on the way out. It is, as we are seeing today, a matter of life and death. Whether we like it or not, demand for our export coal is going to decline and expire.\nThe world must, and I believe will, stop burning coal if we are to avoid the worst consequences of global warming. And the sooner the better. The good news is that thanks to technology we can have abundant energy which is both green and cheap.\nThe cost of solar per watt is declining every year – by 13% last year alone and over 90% over the last eight years. And thanks in large part to research at the University of New South Wales we will soon see a standard solar panel increase its energy efficiency by another 50%. Batteries are seeing similar increases in efficiency and thus affordability. Aemo’s latest estimates show by 2030 new solar backed with six hours of pumped hydro as being more than $40 a megawatt hour cheaper than new black coal even without a carbon price.\nAnd most importantly of all solar and wind are zero marginal cost generators. So they complement storage, like pumped hydro, perfectly.\nThe election is won, and the fires have surely demonstrated that an integrated climate and energy policy is vital.\nThere are simply no more excuses. We cannot allow political prejudice and vested interests to hold us up any longer.\nIf ever there was a crisis not to waste, it is this one. Morrison has the chance now to reinstate the Neg with higher targets. Both he and Josh Frydenberg were among its strongest supporters when I was PM. They abandoned it in the lead-up to an election, to pacify the right wing of the Coalition that sabotaged it in the first place.\nThe election is won, and the fires have surely demonstrated that an integrated climate and energy policy is vital if we are to be serious about cutting emissions.\nDisinformation and lies are spreading faster than Australia's bushfires\nRead more\nAt the same time as we move rapidly to deliver clean and affordable energy we need to make sure that we can respond to the consequences of global warming that cannot be avoided. That too will require careful consideration and planning. The time for spin and bluster is over.\nWe will need to substantially enhance our firefighting resources, which will have to be done in close consultation with the state firefighting agencies not by dictation from Canberra. Respect, consultation and collaboration are the keys here.\nAdvertisement\nThere are many other implications from a hotter, drier climate. Water will be scarcer, droughts more frequent and longer.\nBut there will be rain again, and good seasons too, so we must not become complacent when the immediate crisis abates. The global warming trend is clear, and it is not our friend.\nWe can adapt to a hotter drier climate. But the lies of the deniers have to be rejected. This is a time for truth telling, not obfuscation and gaslighting. Climate change is real. As real as the fires that only a month into summer have consumed nearly 10 million hectares. And our response must be real too – a resilient, competitive, net zero emission economy – as we work to make our nation, and our planet, safe for our children and grandchildren.\n• This essay was originally commissioned as part of Guardian Australia’s forthcoming 2020s Vision series, in which we are asking prominent Australians for ideas that will make Australia better in the next decade.

From 23 March, the wider environmental debate will dominate proceedings inside a West End theatre for eight weeks.\nPerformers including Alistair McGowan, Rob Brydon, Gaby Roslin and Jason Manford are to join experts in the field at the Charing Cross theatre, alongside the double Olivier award-winner and West End leading lady, Janie Dee, for the inaugural London Climate Change festival.\nDee, the force behind the festival, is soon to star on stage in the hit American comedy Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, which has its London premiere at the Charing Cross theatre on 21 March. The play won a succession of top awards during its run in New York, where it starred Sigourney Weaver. The London Climate Change festival, formally unveiled on Monday, will run from March to May and will feature standup, dance, music and cabaret, in addition to talks from a changing line-up of visiting speakers, including the popular environmentalist and author Natalie Fee. It is to be staged with the support of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is loaning exhibits from its recent show, FOOD: Bigger than the Plate. There will also be a series of original displays of key information about how private individuals can slow down the growing impact of climate change.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWest End star Janie Dee, organiser of the Climate Change festival. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images\n“Inspired by Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, we have set up the London Climate Change festival to inform, motivate and bring both hope and guidance on how to live a plastic- and carbon-free life,” said Dee, explaining that she felt uncomfortable about ignoring the problem while appearing in the play. “We want to bring both a necessary focus and ease to the immediate challenges of how we live on this planet.”\nDee, who starred with Imelda Staunton in the highly praised National Theatre production of Stephen Sondheim’s Follies, is now appearing as Madame Dubonnet in an acclaimed Menier Chocolate Factory revival of the Sandy Wilson musical The Boy Friend. But she has put the festival together during breaks in rehearsals.\nWe set up the festival to inform, motivate and bring hope and guidance on how to live a plastic- and carbon-free life.\nJanie Dee, actress and festival organiser\n“In this country, we are all using three times the resources we should be, so this festival needs to be a place for safe conversation from all sides of the debate. We need to be able to talk, to find a positive way to tell the story, at the same time as we all individually withdraw from as many harmful practices as we can,” she said.\nThe festival will bring together contributors from the arts, science and business and the proceeds from its events will be split between the campaigning groups City to Sea, founded by Fee, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, and will also help fund further future activities of the London Climate Change festival.\nAdvertisement\nDuring the day, the Wild Geese theatre company will run workshops for school groups, encouraging them through games and scenes to write a one-act play on the subject of the planet. The workshops will be designed to get visiting children to share their thoughts and ideas for lowering carbon emissions and eradicating the use of plastic.\nArtists from the world of entertainment will be attending as well as performing, along with leading activists, scientists, broadcasters and journalists, including Observer food writer Jay Rayner. There will also be ecologically ethical food and drink available, with the collaboration of the acclaimed chef Skye Gyngell.\nOn Wednesdays and Thursdays, audience Q&A sessions with leading scientists will take place in the auditorium. Among the environmentalists and theorists involved are the teenage conservationist and influencer Bella Lack, and the psychotherapist Caroline Hickman.\nEvening ‘warm up’ sessions will take place at 7pm, with 20 minutes of standup comedy from performers including Brydon, Manford, and Steve Furst, best known as Little Britain’s Lenny Beige, followed by the full performance of the Tony Award-winning Christopher Durang play, Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike. Set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the British production, directed by Tony Award-winner Walter Bobbie, was first performed to critical acclaim at the Theatre Royal Bath last summer. It is a parodic tribute to the poignant plays of Anton Chekov and it tells the story of a brother and sister who are visited by their successful sister, an actress, and her younger boyfriend.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

A hundred Papua New Guinean defence personnel, mostly engineers, will fly to Australia to help with firefighting efforts, and Fijian defence personnel will also be coming to assist. Vanuatu’s government has pledged $250,000. A PNG politician urged people to donate to relief efforts, pledging 50,000 kina (A$20,000) himself.\nFormer Tuvalu PM says he was 'stunned' by Scott Morrison's behaviour at Pacific Islands Forum\nRead more\nAnd then there are the small gestures: a coffee shop in Fiji donated all of its sales on Monday – F$3,000 (A$2,000) – to bushfire relief; a group of Red Cross volunteers in Vanuatu walked down the street collecting donations, carrying a sign reading: “Give hope to Australian bush fire survivors”.\nGiro Imbu, 35, organised a similar donation drive in Lae, Papua New Guinea’s second-largest city, after seeing images of the bushfires on television. Imbu led a group of young people who walked through the city’s settlements on Thursday and Friday collecting donations. On their first day they received 1,000 kina.\n“We see the environment was really devastated, we see the plants being destroyed, we see a lot of the countrymen losing their lives in the fire,” Imbu said. “We’re not very educated, but it has given us a drive … we want to help.”\nTo put all of this in context, in 2017 Vanuatu’s GDP per capita was just under US$3,000, Papua New Guinea’s was about US$2,500, Australia’s was close to US$55,000. The minimum wage in PNG is 3.50 kina (A$1.50) an hour.\nAs Morrison noted at his press conference – speaking about Vanuatu’s pledge of $250,000 – “it might not sound like a lot in terms of the tremendous assistance provided by many other countries, but from them, that was a gift from the heart”.\nThe heartfelt response of Pacific nations to Australia during this time is in part a reciprocation of the assistance Pacific countries receive from Australia when crises befall them. As James Marape, the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, noted in his statement about the fires: “Australia is the closest friend of PNG and is always the first in PNG in our times of adversities.”\nAustralia waters down Pacific Islands plea on climate crisis\nRead more\nAfter Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu in 2015, Australia committed $50m in support for early and long-term recovery. After Cyclone Winston caused damage in Fiji amounting to about 30% of its GDP in 2016, Australia stepped in with $35m for recovery efforts.\nMorrison also reminded the world of Australia’s generosity as he was thanking Pacific countries for theirs, saying: “[Pacific leaders] know how Australia has been faithful to them in their hours of need, and they just in their own way are trying to extend that in the best way they possibly can.”\nBut Australia’s generosity also puts Pacific countries in a tight spot. Pacific leaders have to walk a difficult line: keeping Australia and its financial support on side, particularly as they face the prospect of increased climate-related natural disasters in their countries, while wanting to challenge Australia on its climate policies.\nAdvertisement\nPacific leaders are among the most outspoken and effective climate leaders the world has. We know they are angry at Australia’s refusal to transition away from coal, as well as Australia’s use of carryover credits to meet Paris targets. We know, in the words of the former prime minister of Tuvalu, , Enele Sopoaga, that they see Australia as trying to save its economy, while they are working to save their people.\nWe know that they knowAustralia is not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis – the same climate crisis that is seeing their islands suffer rising sea levels, increasingly frequent devastating cyclones, salinity of the water table, erosion of their islands; that same climate crisis that threatens to make Australia’s current devastating fire season the norm for our future.\nAnd yet, still, they are there to offer us help.\nWhen asked whether he thought it was odd for people in a much poorer country like Papua New Guinea to be raising money for people in a wealthier one, Imbu, who organised the Lae fundraiser, said: “We live in an environment where the richest are getting richer and the poorest getting poorer, but as human beings we have this hardware, we try to help.”\nPacific nations deserve all the thanks Morrison has given them, but to survive, they need much more from him.\nWe've got an announcement …\n… on our progress as an organisation.

The answer is always fudged, along the lines of “individual events cannot be put down to climate change, this is just an extreme of weather, only further research can tell if there is a connection.” This proper and natural scientific caution has been reinforced by decades of attacks by the fossil fuel lobby, plus threats to remove grants and university tenure. The same cautious approach has also infected science journalists who repeat the same formula.\nClimate crisis linked to at least 15 $1bn-plus disasters in 2019\nRead more\nBut this mantra “It’s weather not climate” can now be discarded because Swiss scientists have shown that windstorms, floods, droughts and heat waves – events as short as a single day – can be placed firmly at the door of global heating.\nThe weather will go on varying wildly from day to day but the Swiss have been able to prove that these swings are made worse by extra temperature and moisture in the atmosphere. In other words every extreme has been made greater by man-made climate change.
