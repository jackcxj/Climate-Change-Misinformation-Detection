As well-known non-academic historian, a writer, Nobel Prize winner, and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States – it is no surprise that he is held in high esteem by the Western World.\nWith iconic proverbs attributed to him such as: The price of greatness is great responsibility – Churchill’s influence on contemporary democracy is one that will be remembered for many world wars to come.\nHowever, in the current post-ISIS world of lone wolf gun attacks, extreme class divide, climate change and Donald Trump, it seems there aren’t enough Winston Churchill quotes to go around.\nBetoota-based linguistics professor, Ava Yarne, says that almost every political extreme that planet earth is currently experiencing has been somehow justified by made-up Winston Churchill quotes.\n“Just last month we saw and entire nation’s knee-jerk reaction to highly politicised issues and agendas” she said, referencing the United Kingdom’s recent vote to leave the EU.\n“BREXIT will be remembered as England’s greatest ill-thought out decision. An irreversible one at that. It’s in this kind of circumstance where Churchill really comes in handy”\n“The Brits are usually the first to misquote Churchill, especially when democracy doesn’t work in their favour. In this instance, everyone was seen relaying the misattributed quote of: If you’re not a liberal when you’re 25, you have no heart. If you’re not a conservative by the time you’re 35, you have no brain”\n“This misquote helps them explain as to why only 35% of their under 35s actually voted in the referendum,”\nThe BREXIT result was completely out of both the Queen and Prime Minister’s hands. Something only Winston Churchill could relate to.\nAs for Donald Trump, Professor Yarne says the Americans have realised that their nationwide levels of inequality and racial tension has resulted in a political juggernaut who looks near unstoppable heading into their Presidential election.\n“Very few people in any country have any real insight into any real political issue. But everyone is entitled to a vote,”\nOnly a British aristocrat who was born in the late 1800’s would be able to justify Donald Trump’s rise\n“So as it looks more and more like a three-times bankrupt reality television star could become President of the world’s largest economy, the American population can do nothing but misquote Winston Churchill, those who know who he is,”\n“In this circumstance, the USA are able to explain the hijacked Republican campaign with the following misattributed Winston Churchill quote: The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.”\n“The context of this quote is also mistaken, but it still does the job. This misquote was initially pointing out the average voters feelings of distrust in the system. The modern, Americanized context is more about pointing out the average voters lack of intelligence,”\nHowever, when it comes to Australia’s almost completely balanced Federal election result that has resulted from the nation’s two major parties campaigning for two whole months, only to spend an entire week counting votes down to the final hundreds, Professor Yarne says she has already heard Churchill misquotes being thrown around on talkback interviews.\nAustralian Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten misquotes Churchill during a visit to Woolworths in Queanbean, , Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016. (AAP Image/Andrew Taylor)\n“Australians, for the most part, should absolutely loathe Winston Churchill after the way he bungled Gallipoli and his general lack of respect for the Australian people”\n“However, when times are tough… It’s going to be a Winston Churchill quote that makes everyone feel better – whether it’s true or not,”\n“When it comes to Australia’s stagnate Federal Government, the most appropriate quote to never come out of Winston Churchill’s mouth is: ‘However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.’"},{"title":"Turnbull Challenges Climate Scientists To Guess Which Briefcase Has Funding In It","paragraph":"15 March, 2016. 15:15\nCLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\nFears that some of Australia’s most important climate research institutions will be gutted under a Turnbull government have been realised with deep job cuts for the scientists that have been working to save life on Earth.\nIt is estimated as many as 110 positions in the CSIRO’s Oceans and Atmosphere division will go, with a similarly sharp reduction in the Land and Water division.\nHowever, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has stated that these job cuts and slashes to funding can all be avoided, providing the scientists are able to pick the right briefcase.\n“As you are all aware, I crave innovative and exciting new ways of doing things,”\n“And as opposed to upsetting everyone about the potential redirection of funding, I have invited our governments agencies to go with their ‘gut feelings’ – you never know what you might end up with!”\n“I have twenty-six election promises that I can move around in the next few months. I’ve already signed off on the ones that matter, but the remainders now sit in twenty-six unmarked briefcases,”\nThe Prime Minister has decided to make the upcoming election a little more exciting by inviting representatives from an array of government-dependent agencies to guess which breifcase is the one they will be taking home – starting with the climate sector.\n“The climate challenge is tough…If they can’t work out where the top dollar is using science – how can they expect to solve climate change” said Turnbull.\n“I’ll leave it up to them,”\nLeading Australian climate change scientist, Professor Bartholomew Starkey says that, if given the opportunity, he’ll settle for the Mazda 3. Ironically it’s one of highest polluting cars on the market.\n“The biggest amount he has in those briefcases is only 200k! What are we gonna do with that? That’s fuck all, and now he has the hide to make us compete for it!?”\n“But it’s gonna look like its my fault when I end up with $1200 – isn’t it? He’s a cunning bloke, Old Turnbull.”\nIt is believed Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt has strongly urged the Prime Minister to include a special ‘coal briefcase’ – but it is believed Turnbull is out of favours when it comes to the Minister Of The Year.\nThe next contestant after the climate sector is Women’s Refuge owner and operator, Jenny Mcgraw. She says Turnbull’s “pick-your-own election promise” is a typical “Lord Of The Flies” tactic.\n“He’s pitting us against eachother. He wants us to start slamming climate change, to get more people in our corner for women’s rights,”\n“The libs did it very successfully with the renewables. It was the solar panel crowd that started the rumour that wind power was bad for you,”\n“I’m very nervous about this. I’m worried his role as a charismatic television personality has gotten to his head. He thinks he is Andrew O’Keefe”\nTurnbull dismissed this allegations as pre-election hysteria.\n“Two words. Exciting and innovative. That’s all it is… This has nothing to do with my ego,”\n“I have heaps more women in my cabinet than Tony did. The best way to show them off is with a gold mini skirt and matching wigs,”\n“This is the best deal they are going to get. So I pose the question to them.

We toyed around with “Shitstorm”, but we couldn’t use that because in some cultures Catastrophic is worse than a Shitstorm.”\n“For a while, we were going to use “That time at Engadine McDonald’s in 1997, which is why the background colour is gross, but it was too big to fit on the sign.”\n““NBN” did fit on the sign but when we took it to a focus group we found that people didn’t associate NBN with speed so it clearly wasn’t urgent enough.”\n“Eventually, we settled on “Clusterfuck” after being inspired by the installation of Sydney’s light rail network.”\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office said the new signage was “a great solution to a changing climate, which is not related in any way to climate change”."},{"title":"PM Says Anyone Concerned About His MPs Forging Documents Need To Get Out Of...","paragraph":"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has today taken to his Instagram page today to emphasise that his party are focused on the real issues that matter to Australians, not the political games and noise in Canberra.\nThis is in relation to the current investigation surrounding cabinet minister Angus Taylor and the allegedly doctored document he used to try to discredit Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore and her council over climate change.\nMr Taylor insisted in Parliament that he relied on a document downloaded from the City of Sydney website when he claimed the council spent $15.9 million on travel for its councillors when the real costs were less than $6,000.\nHe also leaked that document to the Coalition’s propaganda arm at NewsCorp, who published it on a front page.\nThe fact that Taylor was $15,894000 off the mark has come as a concern to both his fellow Parliamentarians and the greater public. Many are now questioning whether or not he has been stitched up by his own party handing him misinformation – ‘utegate’ style – or if he is actually just an idiot.\nHowever, Prime Minister Morrison has come out swinging against his government’s critics today, insisting that this particular example of what looks like full-blown forgery, is actually just an echo-chamber issue.\n“Anyone who has an issue with a trusted cabinet minister in my government doctoring official documents to spread lies in an effort to not have to confront his own inaction towards the very real climate crisis is stuck in the Canberra Bubble”\n“Get out of the Canberra Bubble. The Quiet Australians aren’t interested in holding career politicians accountable for telling lies”\n“In fact the Quiet Australians think Angus Taylor is a good bloke and respect him for having such a go. He’s keeping the Promise Of Australia. And he’s burning for us. Like those bushfires”\nMorrison then took it one step further by suggesting his controversial phone call to NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller is also a Canberra Bubble issue.\n“Anyone who thinks I was out of line by calling the sycophantic head of New South Wales Police and attempting to influence his investigation into Taylor needs to go and get their head screwed on,” he said.\n“It’s honestly beyond me how obsessed people get with potential forgery, fraud and abuse of process and power.”\n“Just chill out and watch the cricket or something on.

Which is kind of a weird thing to say when you’ve got a group of 24 fire chiefs telling that you are wrong and that climate change is the issue, and you’ve got 99% of the world’s scientists tell you that Australia is not only contributing 1.5% of emissions at point of emission, but also roughly 30-40% with the dirty coal we keep exporting to India with fuck all royalties and fuck all tax being paid by the multinational Hutt-like coal barons.\nAustralia’s response to climate change has been ranked one of the worst in the G20, with rising greenhouse gas emissions since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014."},{"title":"ScoMo Announces Exciting New Plan To Prevent Future Bushfires","paragraph":"WENDELL HUSSEY | Cadet | CONTACT\nThe under-fire Prime Minister of the country who has spent the last two weeks urging everyone to just calm down a little bit about these fires ripping through the nation has today announced an exciting new policy initiative.\nAfter spending the day watching the cricket and sporadically yelling ‘Niceeeee Garrrrrry’ to his staffers, the Prime Minister exclusively informed The Advocate that he’s finally figured out how to make this unmarketable problem go away.\n“Land clearing,” said the excited Eastern Suburbs of Sydney boy.\n“Myself, Gladys (Berejiklian) and Annastacia (Palaszczuk) put our heads together and we figured out a cutting edge solution to the problem of bush fires, that aren’t exacerbated by Climate Change, which the jury is still out on how much of a thing that actually is,” explained Morrison.\n“But anyway, what we are going to do, is getting rid of all the native vegetation laws and go through there with trucks, chainsaws, dozers and chains.”\n“You can’t have devastating bushfires if you don’t have any bush can ya (sic)”\nMorrison explained that the best part of the whole scheme is that the government wouldn’t even have to do any of the clearing.\n“It’s a win-win.

the Greens have increased the bushfire threat, as he claims a lack of hazard reduction burning has helped fuel fires in regional NSW and Queensland.\nJust like his management of the Murray-Darling basin, and his own drought-ravaged electorate, Mr Joyce says he would have been able to stop these bushfires if the Greenies didn’t get in the way of his 80,000-year-old back-burning models.\nThe former deputy prime minister says that the environmentalist party who have no elected officials in the lower house in NSW and are at best considered a minor party federally, are responsible for the current deadly bushfires ravaging New South Wales and Queensland, because ‘there were too many regulations around controlled burning ahead of bushfire season’.\nHe said climate change action in Australia would do nothing to reduce the bushfire risk unless there was also action taken by China, India and the United States – or any other countries that purchases fairly unclean Australian coal from tax-evading multinational mining corporations whose interests are championed in Parliament House by Sydney University Old Boys who have literally been laughing about water lapping at the door of our Pacific neighbours for the better part of a decade.\nMr Joyce said it was “infuriating” the Greens were attempting to score political points by saying the government’s “inaction” on climate change

from listening to the blackfellas”\nThese comments mark an intelligent new level of climate change debate in Australia, with the National Party now willing to acknowledge ancient Aboriginal land

Mayors from fire-ravaged areas of New South Wales have say there is no doubt in their minds that the devastating blazes tearing through their communities are a result of climate change – a proven scientific phenonemon that causes great inconvenience to the fossil fuel lobbyists and is therefore very rarely discussed or acted on by Australian politicians.\nQueensland’s Labor government have

happen.\nMorrison has also spent the last three days swerving any questions about the bushfire report he was handed seven months ago but shelved the moment he realised how much it mentioned climate change.\nThree people died in fires across the state at the weekend, with the State Government declaring a state of emergency amid predicted catastrophic conditions and predictions that it will only get worse.\nDeputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has taken the opportunity to stick the boot into anyone who brings up the c words in backdrop of the most disastrous fires Australia has ever

what brings him more joy.\nIs it the glee of watching a climate-change-denying Prime Minister attempt to counter the effects of climate change without mentioning climate change – or is the fact that it’s not him up there.\nEither way, the pain of losing the unloseable election has been soothed by the fact that he has narrowly avoided inheriting Australia’s imminent environmental collapse caused by the redefinition of ‘left” and ‘right’ that has seen anyone who cares about the environment labelled ‘snowflakes’ -and anyone whose political views override the findings of 99% of all scientists worldwide by insisting that it is fine to burn fossil fuels into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate for 200 years labelled as ‘common sense’ voters.\n“I’m just glad I didn’t catch this hospital pass in the end” says Shorten.\n“I guess this is what was always coming, whether I won or lost. I’m just glad I don’t have to be that one to lead this country into the apocalypse”\n“Hospital pass” is a term originally used in football codes to describe a pass that subjects the recipient to heavy contact, usually unavoidable, from an opposing player — the expression implying that the recipient of the pass could end up in the hospital – or in this paralell, wearing a RFS jacket and making sure you get photographed hugging someone whose crying.\nAs the former next Prime Minister of Australia has pointed out, after three different Liberal Prime Ministers ousting one another every time someone went anywhere near energy policy, it was almost assured that the next person in charge was going to be left with the catastrophic effects of climate change caused by our own 1.5% of all global carbon emissions – but also the 20-40% caused by the fossil fuels we sell overseas for almost no royalties from the Liberal-donor multinational companies that dig them up while also paying less tax than a suburban refrigeration mechanic.\n“Pheww haha” said Shorten.\n“I just don’t have the power of the Pentecostal rock music Jesus on my side. It’s better that Scotty take control here”"},{"title":"Review Of ALP Election Result Finds Labor Lost Because Not Enough People Voted For...","paragraph":"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\nLabor’s federal election review has identified one major cause for the party’s shock loss in May this year.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in that it does not couch its conclusions in the language of uncertainties, and it does prescribe policies.\nThe study, called the “World scientists’ warning of a climate emergency,” marks the first time a large group of scientists has formally come out in favour of labelling climate change an “emergency”.\nUnfortunately, their refusal to reference the Almighty Lord Jesus Christ in the report has put the Australian Prime Minister off-side.\nMorrison says that these so-called 11 thousands experts from 152 different countries aren’t listening to the Quiet Australians, who are mostly concerned about their retirement nest eggs. He believes this gives him mandate to continue flogging the vulnerable Great Barrier Reef like a 1997 Commodore full of junior rugby league players.\nBut, despite the rapidly shrinking funding, and general disdain that the Australian government holds towards them for presenting such inconvenient research – our nation’s scientists are not giving up yet.\nUsing the widely successful messaging platform of Hillsong Music, a bold group of climatologists are attempting to deliver the urgent warnings of environmental collapse to the Prime Minister, through subtle lyricism and appalling deodorised post-grunge rock.\n“We needed to try new avenues” said one scientist, who refuses to name himself or his band, for fear that Brian Houston will have him schvitzed with radioactive nerve agent for infiltrating their highly-secretive cult of pedophile-apologist Pentecostalism.\n“At least now we’ve got the churchgoers listening to us. We just need to get a gig down in Cronulla. From there, we’ll have to find a way somehow convince Prime Minister Morrison that maybe God isn’t going to be able to save us from the horrors of accelerating our use of fossil fuels despite countless warnings that we are facing mass extinctions”\n“I mean, if this entire congregation can convince themselves that the tax-avoiding church that they give 10% of their annual income to wasn’t

Remake","paragraph":"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\nFollowing on from the let down of the all-female Ghost Busters and Ocean’s 11 remakes, fans of the 1980s Queensland say they are skeptical about the current state Labor government’s reboot of the iconic Sir Joh-era.\nIn this new production, the Queensland Labor are reprising all of the nostalgic conservative policy and anti-free-speech sentiment harboured by the majority National Party government of yesteryear.\nThe new blockbuster state government is hoping to relive the success of the iconic character that was Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen – who was the longest-serving Premier of Queensland, holding office from 1968 to 1987, during which time the state underwent considerable economic development and uncompromising conservatism.\nIt is not yet known if the remake will include state-wide bans on condoms and Special Branch police officers being sent to gay beats to violently bash homosexual men – but it has been confirmed that they will be arresting protesting and fast-tracking laws to have them charged and incarcerated for criticising the government.\nInala MP Annastacia Palaszczuk has been cast as ‘Premier Johanna’, while her deputy Jackie Trad plays ‘Ms Hinze’ and current Environment Minister Kate Jones has taken on the role of ‘The bagwoman’ – who specialises in collecting bribes.\nHowever, die-hard fans of the original say that the Palaszczuk isn’t up to the task, and the new production is barely even a nod to the era of Queensland politics thats brought us Expo 88 and phone-tapping of Aboriginal activists.\nOne notable omission from the remake is Sir Joh’s prioritising of regional Australian issues, as Johanna is seen to be crucifying farmers for clearing invasive flora on their own properties and in turn blaming them for what her pedophiliac coal lobbyists are doing to the Great Barrier Reef.\nThe calls for a remake came from deep within Labor’s internal polling, after realising they hard completely lost touch with Australia’s suburban and rural working classes after Anna Bligh took a job as a lead spokesperson for the Australian Banking Association.\nHowever, Palaszczuk hopes the rusted on fans of 1980s Queensland may be swayed to get behind Johanna – after passing new laws to hand out convictions to the protestors currently holding road blocks in the top-end of Brisbane.\nIn recent months, climate change activists have ramped up efforts to disrupt the coal-mining sector, including by blocking machinery and freight routes. There is a dedicated campaign to disrupt the activities of businesses bidding for contracts with the Adani Carmichael project, which has been identified as the nail in the coffin for the Great Barrier Reef, which represents 90% of sea-life species in the world.\nShe has also sent Special Branch cops down to Musgrave Park to keep an eye on those militant blaks."},{"title":"McCormack Excitedly Shows PM Where The National Party Are Planning On Putting All His...","paragraph":"FRANKIE DeGROOT | News | CONTACT\nIn a meeting of the minds, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has today excitedly taken the Prime Minister for a bit of a tour.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and prominent God-botherer Michael McCormack has walked the PM around a rapidly emptying dam, to show him where all of his prayers can be stored.\nMcCormack has also called on the NSW State Government to immediately convert the Desalination Plant at Kurnell to an industrial Prayer Factory to solve Australia’s drought.\nThis comes after ScoMo yesterday told the nation that the power of prayer can help those suffering from drought and bushfires.\nMcCormack earlier this year suggested that existing proof of climate change couldn’t be trusted because, unlike the contents of the bible, early climate data could be inaccurate.\nHe then added that if farmers wanted rain they should pray for it.\nUnder the $17b plan, the current desalination equipment would be removed and replaced with two 45m-tall aluminium hands, which in times of need would be brought together by huge hydraulic rams in the internationally-recognised symbol of Christian prayer. At the same time, a 60,000W sound system would blast pre-recorded prayers up to heaven so that God will hear them and dispense rain accordingly.\n“It’s very simple actually”, McCormack explained “The prayer power from these simulated hands is much greater because of the huge surface area. Plus when God looks down he will be able to see them much easier and the sound system is so much louder than all of the farmers praying at the same time. Not to mention that some people might be praying to… you know; another, ummmm, you know.”\nThe Deputy PM added that the new facility could also help disperse the rain when it arrived, as the giant hands could potentially be used to give rainclouds a helpful push to regional areas.\n“It’s time to stop listening to scientists; the only thing they’ve given us is climate change, which is wreaking havoc, even though it doesn’t exist. The only sure-fire way to guarantee rain is to pray for it because that always works; eventually.”"},{"title":"Gen-Z Develops Interest In Playing Outside And Drinking From Hose After Fortnite Goes Down","paragraph":"WENDELL HUSSEY | Cadet |CONTACT\nIn some great news for shared Facebook profiles, the nation’s Gen-Z’s have finally been forced to have a childhood.\nThis comes after the popular online game Fortnite crashed yesterday, following an asteroid hitting the game, rendering the platform a black hole at this point in time.\nNews that the game extremely popular among the nations ‘young people’ was down, was initially received rather poorly by the nation’s Gen-Z’s.\nBefore going down, Fortnite had long been criticised by older people who believed that the game was ruining ‘childhood.’\nHowever, in somewhat of a silver lining, the nation’s pre-teens and teens have now all developed a keen interest in playing outside until the street lights go on, drinking from the hose and getting cuts and bruises from tumbles and falls.\n“It’s been incredible,” said an excited childhood expert named Kay Stephens.\n“All of the societal issues around our nation’s children have been solved by that Fortnite game crashing,” she said.\n“Kids have learnt to respect their elders, get outside and get their hands dirty, and have a childhood!”\n“The whole starting fires thing might be a bit a problematic given the lack of action on climate change which has lead to increasingly dangerous bushfire seasons, but we can work on that!”\n“But hey, all in all, it’s a huge positive.

I want them to be worried about the very alarming and rapidly normalised conversations about women who used to be men wanting to use womens toilets”\n“Or, you know…” he chuckled.\n“Muslims.”\n“I know its a very 2013 hot button… But I still reckon it’s worth getting worked up about Muslims. I know a lot of people in my party still are”\nWhen asked what he thinks normal Aussie kids should be getting up to in their free time instead of attending climate rallies, Morrison pointed out that the kids in his electorate are able to have just as much fun attending rallies that don’t make the Liberal Party look bad.\n“In Cronulla, they have rallies on the beach in the holidays!” he said.\n“That’s what our kids should be focusing their energy on”"},{"title":"Greta Wins Over Australian Media By Yelling Racist Taunts While Wearing Collingwood Scarf","paragraph":"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\nUS President Donald has taken a subtle jab at Swedish student activist, Greta Thunberg, just hours after her deeply emotional address to world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.\nMs Thunberg gave a powerful speech on Monday at the summit in which she accused world leaders of ignoring climate change.\nTears streamed down the 16-year-old’s face as she chided them with the repeated phrase, “How dare you”, in an emotional appeal for action, which has since been ridiculed by conservative media as an example of a delusional little brat being triggered lol.\nMr Trump later shared a video of her speech on Twitter and appeared to join in on the pile on.\n“She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So Nice to see!” he wrote above a video of a visibly distressed Ms Thunberg.\nBut while Greta Thunberg is now viewed as the arch-nemesis to climate skeptic baby boomers around the world, she has had at least one win – winning over the conservative Murdoch newspapers in Australia.\nThe 16-year-old appears to have done her research into how to best garner the support of our nation’s media, and did her best to emulate the last teenage girl to make headlines in Australia for a controversial tirade that hurt a lot of peoples feelings.\nBy wearing a Collingwood scarf and yelling racist taunts at a Brownlow-winning AFL superstar, Greta Thunberg has immediately found herself completely shielded from criticism – as the Herald Sun and Australian talkback radio rushes to defend her.\n“How dare Donald Trump publicly shame a teenage girl just trying to enjoy the UN summit. She didn’t know what she was saying” wrote conservative collumnist Andrew Bolt, in his most recent 200 word thought-bubble for the Herald Sun today.\nRadio host Alan Jones has also come out in defence of Greta Thunberg, ever since he learnt about her very public act of bigotry.\n“That is no way to treat a teenage girl” said Jones.\n“Donald Trump needs to stop the aggressive handshakes. People don’t like it”\nCrowds of Victorian and Western Australian bogans have also responded to the Donald Trump’s behaviour by vilifying him online, and booing every time he appears on the screen.\n“DONALD TRUMP IS A FLOG!” wrote one irate social media user with a Fremantle Dockers filter on his Facebook display photo.\n“Donald Trump is a sook.

Or whether or not they were polite in the way they delivered the information that old people aren’t even willing to hear.\nThis is due to the fact that the post-war generation of western baby boomers find Greta Thunberg to be rather insolent for being assertive in the way she talks to men.\nThe immediate resistance to these facts has left the planet terrified that there actually is no way to deliver these concerning scientific facts to old white cunts, who have the luxury of dying with a smooth pillow, before these rainforest fires and rising sea levels start killing people outside of the third world.\n“Maybe we could integrate this alarming climate change data into Nigella Lawson cooking shows” suggests one youth striker from Betoota High School.\n“Or maybe we could get the climate scientists to dress up as Elvis… Maybe then they’ll listen” says another.\n“It’s really hard to know what gets these old cunts excited, outside of not paying tax and pretending to care about veterans of wars they never went to”\nStrangely, despite their current reputation for shitting the bed, the Brexit-weary UK is not included in this debate.

I know times have changed and we have to look like we believe in climate change” he said.\n“But I’m hoping you had a little read through of the budget I pulled together in my 20 months as Prime Minister”\nThe 2014 Australian federal budget was the federal budget to fund government services and operations for the 2014/15 financial year. The 2014 budget was the first delivered by the Abbott Government, since the Coalition’s victory in the 2013 Australian federal election and put a big focus on making the poor pay for medical appointments, while also allowing concessions for ballet, and attempting to cut costs on mental health by replacing trained public school counsellors with Christian clergymen.\nAbbott, who’s is starting to fear his time in the top job has become so irrelevant that he might not even get a state funeral, says if there’s one legacy he’s willing to stand behind, it’s that he made ballet cheaper for rich people in the North Shore.\n“Remember. The punters might like the idea of a free medical appointment, but don’t rob them of the chance for their daughters and lavender-scented sons to learn the elegance of performance dance”\n“Also, don’t underestimate how effective these Christian counsellors are at infiltrating public schools with their spiritual guidance”\nHowever, while confident that his pentecostal Turnbull Lite will make the right decision regarding rich people hobbies and Christian counselling, he also had one big criticism.\n“What’s all this shit about raising the Newstart?”\n“We are creating a welfare state of flakey Australian citizens living off extortionate lifelong pensions for doing fuck all in their lives!”"},{"title":"Nightwatchman Admits He Was On The Sauce For The 6 Months He Spent Plotting...","paragraph":"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\n“This is my leader and I’m ambitious for him [hiccup]” declared a seemingly sincere Scott Morrison, with his hand wrapped around Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of Australia\nThe date was August 22, 2018. Within 48 hours Malcolm Turnbull had resigned and Scott Morrison was sent on as the lower-order leader of the Coalition Government.\nSpeaking exclusively to an undercover Betoota Advocate intern who was posing as a Pentecostal youth pastor while wearing a hidden camera, the Nightwatchman admits to it all. It wasn’t just Tony and Dutton. He was the puppeteer behind last August’s leadership spill that saw Australia change Prime Ministers for the 8th time in eleven years.\nBut it wasn’t the Scott Morrison that we know and love from that inappropriate tourism ad with Lara Bingle. The jovial happy clapping marketing executive wasn’t behind this. This was a different person. A dangerous person. A person we now know as ‘The Nightwatchman’.\nAs the man who so desperately wants to be called ScoMo admits, everything he did in the 6 months leading up until that point happened while clouded by a haze of pure sauce.\n“I was drinking a lot” he said.\n“Six Goldies day at my worst. It was a really bad time”\n“My political ambitions weren’t being met. My burning desires were being held by a glass ceiling that came in the shape of a well-spoken small-L liberal who had endured great success in his life outside politics. It sent me on a spiral. Why did this man deserve to have it all. The skillset to find work outside of politics… and the badge of Prime Minister”\n“That’s why I was drinking”\nMorrison says that while he’s successfully managed to pull off the Boris Johnson-style everyman who accidentally ended up in the top job as a less terrifying alternative to Peter Dutton, it was actually all orchestrated. By him. While he was on the sauce.\n“I felt the way I imagine a gay man feels trapped in a heterosexual marriage, which for most of my life is where I thought they should stay. Well, I still do technically… But, when it comes to this particular comparison that I now regret attempting to make… I felt I deserved more than living my life as a caged bird”\n“Most caged birds sing… But this caged bird. She drank”\n“Sorry. He drank. I’m talking about me. I’m the caged bird in the most recent metaphor”\nMorrison then went on to explain how basically he spent 6 months undermining and white-anting Malcolm Turnbull in an effort to make sure the Liberal Party never won another election with him as leader.\nIt was a calculated plan that would completely remove the former Member for Wentworth’s weird multi-millionaire interests, like climate change and gay rights, from the entire political arena.\n“If he won, the coal companies would be in trouble. If he won, we’d keep seeing convicted child abusing Priests being condemned by our political leaders. That isn’t my Australia”\nThe Nightwatchmen then paused before realising he was getting awfully deep for a light-hearted conversation with a stranger from his Cronulla Church.\n“Anyway” he says, while straightening his jacket and wiping the villainous dilated pupils away.\n“You go for the Sharks?”\n“Haha go Sharkies!”"},{"title":"Shorten To Spend April Practicing Finishes To Ensure He Doesn’t Michael Daley A Steven...","paragraph":"CLANCY OVERELL | Editor | CONTACT\nFollowing NSW Labor’s catastrophic bed-shit over the weekend, the Federal Opposition have decided that it might be worth doing and saying some stuff before the upcoming election.\nHigh-ranking Labor powerbrokers have declared that while the incumbent Prime Bradbury Bill Shorten appears to be scandal-free for now, his lack of policy regarding fish kills, climate change, asylum seekers, decentralisation, infrastructure, and anything else that would warrant an emotive response from the Australian public – probably means he doesn’t have the momentum to carry him through even the slightest of gaffes.\nThese new late-night training sessions will include a special focus on not vilifying Asians to win cheap political points in the Blue Mountains, and talking about things other than stadiums\n“We are going to be going pretty hard on him over the next few weeks,” explained a high ranking union official.\n“Locking him in a room, and forcing him to answer questions and give his opinion on things without informing him what the Government’s position is on the issue.”\n“I’ll be honest with you, the first few sessions were tough.

He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a “draconian” international deal.\n“America has done very well to keep these kinds of articulated, science-based arguments out of the White House and out of our classrooms” he said\n“As for the rising sea levels that also feel the need to make life hard for the American workers, well they can get out of our country too!”\n“I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe.\n“We are building two new walls, and the environment is going to pay for it”\n“The sea levels will not be able to get inside, neither will any of these stupid scientists”\n“Coal is not dead.
