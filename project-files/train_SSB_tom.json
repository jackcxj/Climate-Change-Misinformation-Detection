   "paragraph": "EGU2020 - Sharing Geoscience Online - Live-streamed and Recorded Sessions\nPosted on 10 May 2020 by BaerbelW\nBy far the most sessions throughout Sharing Geoscience Online 2020 were held as live chats, like the one on Monday featuring many citizens science projects I already wrote about. But, the organizers also added some live-streamed and pre-recorded sessions to the schedule and this post features the ones I watched and liked.\nWelcome to Sharing Geoscience Online\nMonday\nThe Great Debate GDB3 titled Cutting carbon in the geosciences: conference participation versus online streaming and fieldwork versus remote observations had been planned well in advance of the Corona pandemic but now couldn't have been more topical!\nThe Short Course SC3.1 \"Open and FAIR Your Science\" featured a pre-recorded podcast-like discussion among Niels Drost, Tim van Emmerik, Rolf Hut, Liek Melsen (from The Netherlands) and Caitlyn Hall (from Tempe, Arizona) about practising open and FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable – research to allow scientists, decision-makers, and the broader public to better access science and engineering research and understand its broader impacts.\nTuesday\nThe Union Symposia US5 highlighted international space agency plans on current and future planetary exploration including Earth as seen by ESA, NASA, JAXA and other space agencies. Some flagship missions observing the Earth and other planetary bodies were highlighted and challenges of organising future missions in an international framework as well as a forward look at potential future candidate missions were discussed:\nTuesday's Short Course SC3.16 \"Science blogging for beginners\" contained helpful hints and suggestions for anybody interested in blogging. With 36 minutes in length - not including the time for the exercise! - it's well-worth watching or checking out the accompanying slides (and not just for scientists or newbie bloggers)!\nWednesday\nWednesday's Union Symposia US3 tackled The role and impact of fire in the Earth system across spatial and temporal scales. Recent record-breaking wildfires in the Arctic, boreal forests, the Mediterranean and, at the same time, human-driven decreases in burned area in savanna ecosystems show the need of an increased understanding of the drivers and impacts of fire regime changes under ongoing and future land management and climate changes.\nThe pre-recorded Short Course SC4.5 \"Mind your head\" had five panellists giving short presentations about various topics within the theme of managing your mental health from their own perspective and based on their own experience. They focused on coping mechanisms and provided some tips on how to deal with certain issues.\nThursday\nIn Thursday's Union Symposia US2 \"Geosciences and UN Sustainable Development Goals: pathways for the future\" were presented and discussed. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. SDGs build on the successes of the Millennium Development Goals, and among other priorities include several new areas such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, peace and justice. The goals are interconnected – often the key to success on one will involve tackling issues more commonly associated with another.\nThe Great Debate GDB5 discussed \"Values versus facts: should geoscience get personal?\" with Stephan Lewandowsky (Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol with research focusing on misinformation, post-truth deception and climate change) as one and Laura Smillie (Policy Analyst, Joint Research Centre, EU Commission and Project Leader of the Enlightenment 2.0 initiative) as the other panelist. The session focused on what makes people believe fake news and misinformation and the impact that this has. After two short presentations the panelists discussed how researchers can communicate their research with people who reject traditional science narratives or when scientists should tap into their audiences' emotions. Several questions from the audience were also discussed.\nFriday\nFriday's Union Symposia US4 asked the pointed question \"Communicating A Global Climate Crisis: If our house is on fire, why haven’t we called the fire brigade…?\" which the panelists tried to find answers for from three very different perspectives. Leo Hickman (Director and editor of CarbonBrief) kicked things off with his journalist's points of view. Jutta Thielen-del Pozo (Head of the Scientific Development Unit at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission) followed with advice about communicating with policy makers and society. Michael Mann (Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State and Director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center) came last and tackled the wide field of denial.\n[Video will be added once it becomes available]\nThe last short course of the week was SC3.6 titled \"What is science for policy and how can you get involved?\". The first half of the session focused on basic science for policy and communication techniques that can be used to engage policymakers. It explained how scientists can get involved with specific science for policy processes and initiatives. The second half of the session featured three speakers who are working at the science-policy interface. They outlined how their role bridges the gap between science and policy and some of the institutionalised routes that scientists can take to connect with policymakers.\nLooking for more?

Now we know that clear skies and silent streets can come about with shocking speed.\nThe pandemic is a cataclysmic event so big and disruptive that it can be measured in the planetary metrics of climate change. As many as 2.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, about 8% of the estimated total for the year, will never be emitted into the atmosphere, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency.

   "title": "PETM climate warming 56 million years ago strongly tied to igneous activity",
   "paragraph": "PETM climate warming 56 million years ago strongly tied to igneous activity\nPosted on 8 May 2020 by howardlee\nPart 1 – The Rabbit Hole\nThis 3-part post is expanded from an article I originally wrote for Quanta Magazine and features quotes from interviews that appeared in that piece.\nBack in 1991, James Kennett of UC Santa Barbara and Lowell Stott of UCLA reported a: “…rapid global warming and oceanographic changes that caused one of the largest deep-sea benthic extinctions of the past 90 million years.” This warming event 56 million years ago became known as the “Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum” or “PETM.” Over the intervening years a considerable body of research has shown that the planet warmed by about 5ºC (9ºF), oceans acidified, sea levels rose, and land suffered an increase in downpours, while hot seas and dead zones stressed ocean life. Land animals underwent a high rate of extinction and replacement by dwarf species, and tiny shell-making creatures on the sea bed (benthic foraminifera) went extinct.\nIt’s the closest natural analog to modern climate change in the last 66 million years, but what caused it?\nThere have been four main ideas: methane emissions after the planet crossed a climate tipping point; volcanic activity; a comet impact; or burning peat. Evidence for the volcanic trigger has been growing over recent years, and now a new study ties the underground part of volcanic activity to the PETM in a quantified way, from mantle motion to climate warming, calculated independently from - yet matching - the sedimentary record of the carbon cycle and temperature changes. The new study, by a team from the University of Birmingham, UK, has helped to convince more scientists that volcanic activity probably triggered the warming, and this knowledge helps constrain its lessons for our own climate change today.\nThis post is in 3 parts – in part 1, I review competing explanations for the cause of the PETM, in part 2 I report on the results of the new study, and in part 3 I report the reactions of other scientists, and what the new results tell us about our warming in the years to come.\nThe Arctic looked like this 56 million years ago – modern Baldcypress Swamp in Louisiana. Photo by Jan Kronsell CC BY-SA 3.0\nCauses and consequences\nThe trigger for the PETM has been debated since its discovery. The main ideas have been: methane emissions after crossing a climate tipping point; volcanic activity; a comet impact; or burning peat.\nMethane tipping point:\nThe leading idea for what caused the PETM has long been a rapid release of methane from a reservoir of methane ice known as “methane clathrates” or “methane hydrates.” Scientists worried that, if that was the case, a similar thing could happen today, where seabed methane clathrates could be destabilized by human-driven warming, greatly magnifying our own climate change.\nBut even Gerald Dickens, the original proponent of the clathrate hypothesis in 1995, published a paper in 2011 titled: “Down the Rabbit Hole…” where he stated that it “lacks proof.” The main leg that hypothesis had to stand on was the carbon isotope signature in sediments around the world. This showed a strong increase in the isotope carbon-12 relative to carbon-13, indicating a big release of organic, rather than volcanic, carbon. Methane from clathrates is organic and very rich in carbon-12, so less is needed to explain the shift in the isotopes than if the carbon was volcanic, which has much less carbon-12. Yet that’s also a problem for clathrates – they are so rich in carbon-12 that if the PETM was triggered by a purely clathrate source, the volume you need to reproduce the isotope shift in sediments is insufficient to generate the warming. There must be additional carbon from a non-clathrate source mixed in.\nMethane hydrates (clathrates) on fire - USGS\n\"there are no any two records which share the consistent pattern\"\nOne problem with the clathrate hypothesis is that it, in turn, needs an external trigger to destabilize the clathrates. The idea was that Earth’s climate warmed just before the PETM, enough to destabilize seabed methane clathrates and unleash the really strong warming as a positive feedback. A crucial observation in favor of this is that the signal for warming precedes the shift in carbon isotopes in some mid- and high-latitude sedimentary records, suggesting that the organic carbon signal was in response to, not the initial driver of, the warming. But this has been hard to pin down definitively because of the short timescales involved compared to the slow accumulation of sediments, and the fact that “there are no any two records which share the consistent pattern of the [isotope shift],” as Chen et al put it in their 2014 paper. More recently it has been shown that, particularly for lake deposits like the ones studied by Chen et al, the temperature signal in some biochemical indicators of ancient temperature can be confused by how waterlogged they are.\nChen et al proposed that volcanic eruptions may have provided the initial carbon to destabilize clathrates, whereas the leading idea has long been that Earth’s orbit around the Sun was in an unusually warm configuration that caused Earth to cross a climate tipping point that liberated seabed methane from clathrates into the atmosphere.\nThe reason scientists thought that orbits must be involved is because the PETM is the most prominent of a number of warm periods (dubbed “hyperthermals”) spread across 3 million years of the Eocene, several of which are in sync with wobbles in Earth’s orbit (Milankovitch Cycles).\nthe PETM is quite different from those other hyperthermals\nBut chaos swamps calculations of orbits older than about 50 million years, and many sedimentary records have gaps, so it’s possible to calculate either an orbital configuration that supports an orbital push to begin the PETM, or one that is out of phase. Others have argued that the PETM is quite different from those other hyperthermals and so requires a different explanation: it was twice as big, and much more abrupt, and they argue that those subsequent hyperthermals are just the normal orbital climate drumbeat found in sediments throughout geological time, without the need for clathrate release to explain them.\nAnother problem for the clathrate hypothesis is that it needs a large reservoir of clathrates to be there in the first place. We know they exist in today’s seabed but the Paleocene ocean was much warmer than today’s, so the reservoir was probably as good as empty. A third problem is that even if there was a release of seabed methane, about half would never make it to the atmosphere (so double the reservoir is needed to explain the warming) and it would also have been too slow.\nLast year it looked, briefly, like barium could be the smoking gun of seabed methane release. Joost Frieling of Utrecht University, with colleagues, observed that barium was deposited in sediments during the PETM at triple the normal rate. Since water in sediments around methane clathrates contains an abundance of dissolved barium, this uptick in barium could be a sign of seabed methane release. Unfortunately, as Luke Bridgestock of Oxford University and colleagues observed in a paper published around the same time, barium doesn’t last in the ocean long enough to explain the protracted barium burial, and there’s no evidence for an increase in barium sulfate saturation in ocean water over that time interval. The increased barium burial, Bridgestock et al argue, is instead due to increased biological activity after the initial phase of the PETM, and not seabed methane at its onset.\nPermafrost is another reservoir of carbon-12 that could have been released by warming from orbital wobbles, much like clathrates. But here again there probably wasn’t much permafrost in the Paleocene because fossils show that the Arctic supported alligators, giant tortoises, palms and swamp-cypresses, while Antarctica was mostly ice-free and forested. Antarctic glaciation seems to have begun some 20 million years after the PETM and even mountains close to the South Pole were tree-covered well into the Miocene.\nComet impact:\nan instant release of carbon such as from a comet impact doesn’t match the protracted sedimentary record\nIn 2013 Morgan Schaller of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York and James Wright of Rutgers University in New Jersey proposed that a comet impact may have driven the PETM but, as responses to their paper showed, an instant release of carbon such as from a comet impact doesn’t match the protracted sedimentary record of carbon release and warming. There are indeed traces of an asteroid or comet impact in some PETM sediments dated to about the right time, tentatively linked to the Marquez Crater in Texas, which reportedly overlies a petroleum reservoir. But the crater is only 12.7 km wide and would be too small to contain anything close to enough carbon. Geochemical tracers such as mercury are sustained or pulsed in a manner not consistent with a singular, instantaneous comet impact, but consistent with volcanic activity. Schaller recently proposed that an impact may have served as an initial trigger, with volcanic activity doing the main body of work. This echoes a recent theory linking the end-Cretaceous Chicxulub impact to eruptions in the Deccan Traps, but the comet idea doesn’t have much traction with most PETM scientists I’ve spoken to over recent years.\nComet Ison November 2013 - NASA\nPeat fires:\nIn 2003 Andrew Kurtz of Boston University and colleagues suggested that burning peat might be the source of the organic carbon, rather than methane clathrates or permafrost. But the absence of charred peat from that time argues against a widespread peat conflagration as a trigger for the PETM, and Arctic wildfires seem to have increased later in the PETM, rather than at its onset.\nA smoldering peat fire on Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, 2011 - Chris Lowie/USFWS\nVolcanic Activity:\nA volcanic trigger for the PETM was first proposed in 1993 and unlike the other theories there’s a substantial body of physical evidence to support it.\nThe vast assemblage of igneous rocks in Greenland, the British Isles, and under the North Atlantic seabed, are collectively known as the “North Atlantic Igneous Province” or “NAIP.” Its initial phase around 60 million years ago created the spectacular columned basalt landscapes of Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, and Scotland’s “Fingal’s Cave” that inspired Mendelssohn’s composition.\nPresent-day extent of the North Atlantic Igneous Province based on Hansen et al 2009 and Horni et al 2017. Red - igneous rocks including flood basalts, sills, dikes and central volcanic complexes.\nIn addition to the rocks, there are geochemical traces of volcanic mercury and osmium in sediments that formed at the time, and buried igneous rocks of that age are mapped in many seismic scans and encountered in many oil exploration boreholes in the North Atlantic region.\nThe NAIP is an example of a “Large Igneous Province” or “LIP.” LIPs are behind most of the large climate warming events since the dawn of animals, and behind most mass extinctions, so a link between the NAIP and the PETM would fit that oft-repeated pattern.\nBut coincidence isn’t causation, so the question remains: how exactly do you go from volcanic activity to climate warming? And how do you explain the apparently contradictory evidence pointing to a large release of organic – not volcanic – carbon?\nTo be continued in part 2\nCitations\nKennett, J. P., & Stott, L. D.

   "title": "How does the way we define methane emissions impact the perception of its effects on global warming?",
   "paragraph": "How does the way we define methane emissions impact the perception of its effects on global warming?\nPosted on 4 May 2020 by Justine_Wickman\n11-15% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are a result of raising livestock (Yusuf et al. 2012; Gerber 2013). The discussion surrounding the value of low-meat diets, such as vegan and vegetarian diets, in reducing global warming through reduced GHG emissions is ongoing. Livestock produce methane and CO2 emissions, which are currently defined by their 100-year or 20-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) where all gases are treated as equivalent to CO2 and the way it acts in the atmosphere.\nThis approach has limitations due to the variation between long-lived gases like CO2 and short-lived gases like methane, in the way that they are broken down in the atmosphere and their resulting effect on global warming (Shackley & Wynne 1997). New methods to define the global warming effect of greenhouse gases that take into account these differences are changing the way that we look at livestock emissions.\nOne way to visualise the differences in short-lived and long-lived GHGs is to imagine pouring water into a cup with a hole in the bottom at the same rate as the water was falling out the hole. In this scenario, the amount of liquid in the cup would remain constant. If the cup did not have the hole, the amount of water in the cup would increase. This is the same for GHGs.\nMethane released into the atmosphere is like pouring water into the cup with the hole: the ongoing process of methane conversion means that it does not inevitably accumulate over time in the same way as CO2. However, CO2 is long-lived in the atmosphere; therefore, as more CO2 is emitted it accumulates, like pouring water into an intact cup.\nThis allows stark differences to be seen with the effect of these gases. So, how can a single metric of measurement give a true picture of their effects on global warming? Conventionally, GWP100 (100-year Global Warming Potential) measurements are standardised to the equivalent of a single burst of CO2 emissions (Epa 2017). This does not take into account the difference in the heating effect of short-lived gases like methane compared to long-lived gases such as CO2. A new metric that can encompass the warming effect of both short-lived gases and long-lived gases has been developed, GWP* (Allen et al. 2018).\nThere are two parts to the understanding of the effect that this has on defining methane emissions, one more complex than the other. The simple observations that can be made relating to methane emissions is as follows. Methane has a more potent warming effect than CO2; however, due to its short-lived nature, with constant emissions there is no increase in temperature as the amount in the atmosphere reaches an equilibrium where it is broken down at the same rate that it is added. The effect is an elevated but constant temperature (Figure 1b). In contrast, CO2 concentration has a practically linear effect on warming meaning that temperature increases with constant CO2 emissions (Figure 1a).\nFigure 1: a) The effect of constant CO2 emissions on warming showing that warming increases. b) The effect of constant emissions of methane on warming showing that warming is elevated but stable.\nHowever, as previously mentioned this does not fully explain the extent to which methane is broken down in the atmosphere because methane degrades into a small amount of CO2, which is long-lived. Therefore, short-lived methane emissions have an influence on the CO2 levels so that even when the warming effect of the original methane emissions have gone, the effect of the resulting CO2 is still prevalent (Figure).\nWhy is this important?\nLivestock have been linked to emissions of both CO2 and methane. They directly produce methane as a by-product of their digestion and in their manures. A single molecule of methane has a stronger warming effect compared to a single molecule of CO2. Therefore, it has been widely claimed that reducing intake of meat would have a huge positive effect on the climate warming issue (Yusuf et al. 2012). If everyone became vegan overnight so that livestock associated methane emissions stopped, the temperature would decrease, and the warming caused by livestock methane would be undone in a relatively short time (Figure 2), discounting the warming caused by the resulting CO2.\nFigure 2: Effect of reducing livestock numbers so that they are producing no methane emissions and the associated change in warming when discounting the resulting CO2produced when methane is degraded.\nHowever, this new definition of methane emissions that takes into account that it is short-lived gives a different perspective of the potential effects of stopping meat intake and therefore its associated methane emissions. After this initial reduction, the temperature would level out again at a lower level. Also, while emissions are not increasing, no further addition in temperature as a result of methane would occur. In contrast, all CO2 emissions cause an increase in temperature, regardless if they are comparatively less than before because they will still cause an overall increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.\nTherefore, with the aim to reduce global warming, reducing methane emissions (e.g. through reduction of meat intake) is helpful to provide an immediate reduction in temperature, but long-lived gases such as CO2 still need to be reduced in order to have a long-term effect on global temperature (Allen et al. 2018).\nReferences\nAllen, M.

Credit: Bob Berwyn\nFrom the frozen crags of the Andes and Rockies to country-sized ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica, global warming is melting the world's ice at a dizzying rate. In the last five years, mountain glaciers have unexpectedly disintegrated and collapsed, including a pair of deadly ice avalanches in Tibet. In Alaska, a quarter-mile section of the Flat Creek glacier broke away and oozed down the valley, mowing down 400-year-old trees.\nThis ice loss is worrying for many reasons. Modern humans evolved on a planet where ice has been a crucial regulator, reflecting some of the sun's heat back to space, and storing huge amounts of moisture—about 69 percent of the world's freshwater is stored in glaciers and ice sheets. Slow melting and replenishment were in balance for 10,000 years or so, until human-caused global warming disrupted the cycl\nThe meltdown is having impacts across the planet. As ice melts off Greenland and Antarctica their gravitational mass decreases, sending the water surging toward the equator, where sea level rising two or three times as fast as the global average is already swamping islands. A study published April 30 in the journal Science helps show from where the water is coming, and exactly which processes are causing it.\nThe loss of mountain glaciers is disconcerting for cities and farming areas in the Western United States and other areas that rely on slow-melting mountain ice. Alpine towns that have faced giant avalanches of ice, mud, rocks and snow are also anxious and in South America, mountain towns are threatened by sudden floods from collapsing glaciers.\nOn a Melting Planet, More Precisely Tracking the Decline of Ice by Bob Berwyn, InsideClimate News, Apr 30, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article as originally published on the InsideClimate News website.\nToon of the Week...\nHat tip to the Stop Climate Denial Denial Facebook page.\nComing Soon on SkS...\nHow does the way we define methane emissions impact the perception of its effects on global warming?

   "paragraph": "Michael Moore's 'Planet of the Humans' documentary peddles dangerous climate denial\nPosted on 1 May 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nEnvironmentalists and renewable energy advocates have long been allies in the fight to keep unchecked industrial growth from irreversibly ruining Earth’s climate and threatening the future of human civilization. In their new YouTube documentary “Planet of the Humans,” director Jeff Gibbs and producer Michael Moore argue for splitting the two sides. Their misleading, outdated, and scientifically sophomoric dismissal of renewable energy is perhaps the most dangerous form of climate denial, eroding support for renewable energy as a critical climate solution.\n“Planet of the Humans” by the end of April had more than 4.7 million views and fairly high scores at the movie critic review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary has received glowing reviews from numerous climate “deniers” whose names are familiar to those in the climate community, including Steve Milloy, Marc Morano, and James Delingpole. Some environmentalists who have seen the movie are beginning to oppose wind and solar projects that are absolutely necessary to slow climate change.\nThe film by these two “progressive” filmmakers may succeed where Fox News and right-wing talk radio have failed: to undermine humanity’s last best hope for positive change. As energy journalist Ketan Joshi wrote, the film is “selling far-right, climate-denier myths from nearly a decade ago to left-wing environmentalists in the 2020s.”\nThe film follows Gibbs as he visits various green technology sites in the United States and ostensibly learns that each one is just as bad as the fossil fuel infrastructure that it would replace. Unfortunately, the movie is littered with misleading, skewed, and outdated scenes.\n“Planet of the Humans”‘ approach is fundamentally flawed – Gibbs focuses almost exclusively on the imperfections of technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, biomass, and electric cars without considering their ability to reduce carbon and other pollutants. The film suggests that because no source of energy is perfect, all are bad, thus implying that the very existence of human civilization is the problem while offering little in the way of alternative solutions.\nA badly outdated portrait of solar and wind\nIn an interview with Reuters, Michael Moore summarized the premise of the film: “I assumed solar panels would last forever. I didn’t know what went into the making of them.”\nIt’s true. Solar panels and wind turbines don’t last forever (though they do last several decades), and like every other industrial product, they require mining and manufacturing of raw materials. Sadly, that’s about as deep as the film delves into quantifying the environmental impacts of renewable energy versus fossil fuels. In fact, the misinformation in the film is at times much worse than ignorance.\nIn one scene, author and film co-producer Ozzie Zehner falsely asserts, “You use more fossil fuels [manufacturing renewables infrastructure] than you’re getting benefit from. You would have been better off burning the fossil fuels in the first place instead of playing pretend.”\nThat’s monumentally wrong. A 2017 study in Nature Energy found that when accounting for manufacturing and construction, the lifetime carbon footprints of solar, wind, and nuclear power are about 20 times smaller than those of coal and natural gas, even when the latter include expensive carbon capture and storage technology. The energy produced during the operation of a solar panel and wind turbine is 26 and 44 times greater than the energy needed to build and install them, respectively. There are many life-cycle assessment studies arriving at similar conclusions.\nThe film’s case is akin to arguing that because fruit contains sugar, eating strawberries is no healthier than eating a cheesecake.\nIt’s true that the carbon footprint of renewable energy is not zero. But the film somehow fails to mention that it’s far lower than the fossil fuel alternatives, instead falsely suggesting (with zero supporting evidence) that renewables are just as bad. The closest defense of that argument comes when Zehner claims that wind and solar energy cannot displace coal, and instead retired coal power plants are being replaced by even larger natural gas plants.\nIn reality, coal power generation in the U.S. has declined by about half (over 1 trillion kilowatt-hours) over the past decade, and it’s true that natural gas has picked up about two-thirds of that slack (670 kWh). But growth in renewables has accounted for the other one-third (370 kWh). As a result, power sector carbon emissions in the U.S. have fallen by one-third since 2008 and continue to decline steadily. In fact, electricity is the only major sector in the U.S. that’s achieving significant emissions reductions.\nIt’s true that natural gas is a fossil fuel. To reach zero emissions, it must be replaced by renewables with storage and smart grids. But thus far the path to grid decarbonization in the U.S. has been a success story that the film somehow portrays as a failure. Moreover, that decarbonization could be accelerated through policies like pricing carbon pollution, but the film does not once put a single second of thought into policy solutions.\nIn perhaps its most absurd scene, Gibbs and Zehner visit a former solar facility in Daggett, California, built in the mid-1980s and replaced 30 years later. Gazing upon the sand-covered landscape of the former facility, Gibbs declares in an ominous tone, “It suddenly dawned on me what we were looking at: a solar dead zone.”\nDaggett is located in the Mojave Desert. Sand is the natural landscape. Solar farms don’t create dead zones; in fact, some plants thrive under the shade provided by solar panels.\nIt suddenly dawned on me how hard the film was trying to portray clean energy in a negative light.\nA shallow dismissal of electric vehicles\nIn another scene, Gibbs travels to a General Motors facility in Lansing, Michigan, circa 2010, as GM showcased its then-new Chevy Volt plug-in electric hybrid vehicle. Gibbs interviews a representative from the local municipal electric utility provider, who notes that they generate 95% of their supply by burning coal, and that the power to charge the GM facility’s EVs will not come from renewables in the near future.\nThat is the full extent of the discussion of EVs in the film. Viewers are left to assume that because these cars are charged by burning coal, they’re just greenwashing. In reality, because of the high efficiency of electric motors, an electric car charged entirely by burning coal still produces less carbon pollution than an internal combustion engine car (though more than a hybrid). The U.S. Department of Energy has a useful tool for comparing carbon emissions between EVs, plug-in hybrids, conventional hybrids, and gasoline-powered cars for each state. In Michigan, on average, EVs are the cleanest option of all, as is the case for the national average power grid. In West Virginia, with over 90% electricity generated from coal, hybrids are the cleanest option, but EVs are still cleaner than gasoline cars.\nIn short, EVs are an improvement over gasoline-powered cars everywhere, and their carbon footprints will continue to shrink as renewables expand to supply more of the power grid.\nA valid critique of wood biomass\nThe film devotes a half hour to the practice of burning trees for energy. That’s one form of biomass, which also includes burning wood waste, garbage, and biofuels. Last year, 1% of U.S. electricity was generated by burning wood, but it accounted for 30% of the film run time.\nIn fairness, Europe is a different story, where wood biomass accounts for around 5% of electricity generation, and which imports a lot of wood chips from America. It’s incentivized because the European Union considers burning wood to be carbon neutral, and it can thus be used to meet climate targets. That’s because new trees can be planted to replace those removed, and the EU assumes the wood being burned would have decayed and released its stored carbon anyway.\nThere are numerous problems with those assumptions, one of which is unavoidable: time. Burning trees is close to carbon neutral once a replacement tree grows to sufficient maturity to recapture the lost carbon, but that takes many decades. In the meantime, the carbon released into the atmosphere accelerates the climate crisis at a time when slashing emissions is increasingly urgent. That’s why climate scientists are increasingly calling on policymakers to stop expanding this practice. So has 350.org founder Bill McKibben since 2016, despite his depiction in the film as a villainous proponent of clearcutting forests to burn for energy.\nIt’s complicated, but the carbon footprint of biomass depends on where the wood comes from. Burning waste (including waste wood) as biomass that would decay anyway is justifiable, but also generally only practical at a relatively small scale. A more detailed investigation of the wood biomass industry could make for a worthwhile documentary. It’s still a small-time player, but it does need to stay that way.\nThe bottom line\nGibbs asks, “Is it possible for machines made by industrial civilization to save us from industrial civilization?”\nWhy not? Industrial civilization has a non-zero climate and environmental footprint, but the impact of green technologies like EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels is much smaller than the alternatives. They represent humanity’s best chance to avoid a climate catastrophe.\nThe filmmakers call for an end to limitless economic growth and consumption. It’s difficult to envision that goal being achieved anytime soon, but even if it is, human civilization will continue to exist and require energy. To avert a climate crisis, that energy must be supplied by the clean renewable technologies pilloried in the film. To expand on the earlier analogy, the filmmakers seem to believe we should improve nutrition not by eating healthier foods like strawberries, but rather by eating a bit less cheesecake.\nLike Fox News and other propaganda vehicles, the film presents one biased perspective via carefully chosen voices, virtually all of whom are comfortable white men. It applies an environmental purity test that can seem convincing for viewers lacking expertise in the topic. Any imperfect technology – which is every technology – is deemed bad. It’s a clear example of the perfect being the enemy of the good. In reality, this movie is the enemy of humanity’s last best chance to save itself and countless other species from unchecked climate change through a transition to cleaner technologies."

   "title": "A leading scientist's transition from climate science to solutions",
   "paragraph": "A leading scientist's transition from climate science to solutions\nPosted on 30 April 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nGeorgia Tech scientist Kim Cobb emphasizes a point at a December 2019 TedX talk.\nDr. Kim Cobb is an award-winning climate scientist at Georgia Tech and a lead author of the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. However, over the past several years, the very climate changes she has researched have conspired to change the course of her career.\n2016 was the turning point. That year, global warming combined with a monster El Niño event to shatter the previous record for Earth’s hottest year and devastate the coral reefs she had studied for nearly two decades. In 2017 and 2018, flooding events along the Georgia coast brought the impacts of climate change even closer to home.\n“I decided to go ‘all in’ on climate solutions, personally and professionally,” Dr. Cobb said in a phone interview from her home office. She began changing her lifestyle to lower her personal carbon footprint, slashing her flights to scientific conferences despite that decision’s professional costs, and shifting her focus in the direction of climate solutions.\nDevastating coral bleaching\nCobb and her colleagues had been studying coral reefs in the Northern Line Islands – located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, about 1,200 miles south of Hawaii – since 1997. By examining the oxygen isotopes in the calcium carbonate of their coral samples, the team was able to create a valuable reconstruction of ocean temperatures in the region going back as far as 7,000 years.\nCoral reefs, among the most diverse ecosystems in the world, are highly vulnerable to the one-two punch of heatwaves and ocean acidification that result from rising carbon dioxide levels due to humans burning fossil fuels. El Niño events warm sea surface temperatures by disrupting the mixing of cooler waters from below, and the El Niño of 2015-2016 was the strongest such event since, coincidentally, that of 1997-1998, when Cobb first began her regular treks to the Line Islands.\nThe main difference between the two events? Global warming continued to raise baseline temperatures during the intermediate two decades. As a result, in the central Pacific, the marine heatwave of 1997-1998 was not as strong or long-lasting as that in 2015-2016. The corals at her research site were minimally impacted by the former, but the latter was a much different story.\n“Most of the reef was obliterated in 2016, with up to 90% mortality,” Cobb explained. “Nothing prepared me for those dives. The feeling of loss was worse because it was an avoidable loss. As scientists, we’ve been warning about this for decades. For me, it was a bellwether event.”\nWhile some of the Line Island corals have begun to rebound since 2016, a full recovery of coral size and diversity would take over 50 years under good conditions. Climate change, however, will continue to stress the coral reefs. In fact, they experienced mild bleaching stress again in 2019 despite the lack of an El Niño event last year.\nIn October 2019, Cobb and her colleagues published a paper that used their Line Islands coral record to show that climate change appears to have intensified El Niño events over the past 50 years as compared to the prior 7,000 years. Cobb’s corals were able to tell the story of their own demise.\nDr. Cobb, meet Dr. Clark\nIn 2017, Hurricane Irma caused widespread damage in Georgia, including flooding the home of Dr. Russell Clark, a research scientist in Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science. On Thanksgiving Day in 2018, Clark found his neighborhood unexpectedly inundated again – this time on a sunny day. Such “sunny day flooding events” can occur when strong winds in the right direction coincide with high tide, which will happen more frequently as sea levels continue to rise due to global warming. A few months later, his path intersected with Cobb’s.\n“I met Kim Cobb at an organizational meeting for the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge,” said Clark. “In retrospect, the timing was perfect for both of us to turn our passion for the importance of addressing climate change into a new research initiative.”\nCobb in early 2018 became inaugural director of the Georgia Tech Global Change Program. That effort trains a new generation of leaders to pursue climate solutions, and it was looking to build cross-campus collaborations. Her expertise in oceanography and climate change, combined with Clark’s expertise in sensors and information technology, presented an opportunity to address the data gap that had led to Clark’s lack of advance warning on that soggy Thanksgiving Day.\nAfter obtaining a starter grant and meeting with local government agencies, their new team was able to develop and deploy a Smart Sea Level Sensor Network along the coast near Savannah, Georgia. The sensors provide tidal data in an area that was previously covered by a lone tide gauge, to verify and improve predictions made by an area-specific coastal ocean model. The model will give local residents advanced warning of potential flooding events like the one that ruined that 2018 Thanksgiving day.\n“The Smart Sea Level Sensors project has been successful because of the personal commitments of so many people to engage students and community members in creating solutions for adapting to the realities of sea-level rise and the broader challenges of climate change,” Clark explains.\nWorking with social justice groups\nDuring workshops with local stakeholders, Cobb and her colleagues took note of the absence of local minority communities. Together with her city of Savannah partners, they arranged a meeting with leaders at the Harambe House who long have worked on environmental justice issues in the city. It became clear that concerns of underserved populations differ significantly from those of wealthy coastal property owners. Communities further inland are sandwiched between a major interstate highway and the industrial operations at the Port of Savannah. In those neighborhoods, the detrimental health effects of poor air quality and exposure to industrial toxins posed much more pressing concerns than coastal flooding.\nAs a result, Cobb’s team developed an air quality sensor network using the same infrastructure as the sea level sensors and began deploying the network of sensors in February 2020. The leaders at Harambe House suggested focusing deployment first on local schools, where the data can be integrated into the student curriculum while monitoring the quality of the air the students breathe.\nTestifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.\nIn February 2019, Cobb testified on a climate change at a hearing held by the House Natural Resources Committee. After she delivered her testimony, committee members engaged others testifying, but not Cobb, with follow-up questions. She acknowledges that the resulting discussion focusing on environmental justice was an important one.\nStill, Cobb says she had hoped to engage committee members in a conversation about what science-based climate policy could look like. In addition to pricing carbon pollution, she had hoped to discuss nature-based climate solutions, including measures to both mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts.\nFor example, coastal wetland maintenance can help protect communities from rising seas and promote diverse ecosystems. Forest management – especially in a world with growing wildfire risks – is critical to both slowing global warming through the carbon sequestered by the trees, and minimizing hazards to communities at the forest-urban interface. However, the Australian bushfires and new research indicating that climate-related factors like worsening droughts are limiting the carbon storage potential of tropical forests worry Cobb, who described herself as “sobered to my core by the shifting landscape for forest potential,” just as the new House Republican climate plan centers around planting trees.\nFor Cobb, the experience helps illustrate the need for climate policy to be based on sound up-to-date climate science research, which will require better coordination between policymakers and climate scientists.\nCreating more climate solutions\nIn the meantime, the Georgia Tech Global Change Program is churning out students well-informed about climate policy solutions. The program includes the Carbon Reduction Challenge, in which students design and conduct large-scale energy efficiency projects over a period of 10 weeks. The winning team in 2017 included students who had interned at Truist (formerly SunTrust) Banks. Their plan included changing the bank employee default rental car size during travel from intermediate to economy class and reducing travel by using more video conferencing. The plan was quickly implemented and saved the bank money while reducing its carbon footprint.\nCobb has also taken steps to minimize her own personal carbon footprint. She now bikes to work, composts, and dries clothes on a line, and she has installed solar panels on her home and has become vegetarian. “I just wish I’d started sooner,” she says. “But my hope is that more and more folks will pick up the cause and use their unique talents and passions to advance climate solutions at all scales.”\nWhen she realized that air travel was her biggest source of emissions, Cobb scaled back her flights to scientific conferences and instead offered to speak remotely. In February 2020, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) retracted her invitation to be a plenary speaker at a major ocean sciences meeting because she declined to fly to San Diego, and AGU did not provide a remote speaking option. Cobb says she was incredibly disappointed.\n“We’re living through an era of accelerating climate change, with thousands of AGU scientists playing a key role in documenting those indicators. I understand that it’s hard to imagine a remote keynote delivering the same value as an in-person keynote, but we’re going to have to get creative, and fast, in transitioning to alternative models. We have to start somewhere, embrace its imperfections, and improve it as we go. I’m excited that my pledge to stay on the ground for 2020 has sparked some larger conversations, and that more and more folks are joining that conversation through pledges of their own. We’ll get there, but the gears will have to grind a bit on the way.”\nCobb’s shift toward focusing more on climate change solutions, spurred by its direct impacts on her research site and coastal communities in her own state, is illustrative. She may be blazing a path for more climate scientists to follow, although she notes that academic funding and rewards structures will have to change to adjust accordingly.\n“I’m incredibly heartened by the broad array of scientists who want to pivot to climate solutions research. From social scientists to natural and physical scientists, the response to large-scale projects focused on climate solutions has been amazing. People want to do this work, to lend their talents, to learn new techniques and new applications. We know what’s required, and it’s not what we learned in graduate school,” she says.\n“Funding streams generally do not reflect this drive towards transdisciplinary research, and accordingly many scientists are stuck in funding ruts to keep their labs afloat, even while they devote time and energy to unfunded work on climate solutions,” Cobb says. “That situation could change as the rewards of this new research roll out in coming years. In the meantime, there is an emerging generation of students already benefiting from these early forays. They can chart careers in climate solutions that I can only dream of right now.”"

   "paragraph": "Planet of the humans: A reheated mess of lazy, old myths\nPosted on 28 April 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Ketan Joshi's Earth, science and technology blog\nThe film ‘Planet of the Humans’ opens with the director, Jeff Gibbs, operating a fossil-fuelled combustion engine vehicle, on a road full of combustion engine vehicles, followed up with some footage taken from the International Space Station (fossil fuelled rockets put that in space).\nThis is not a documentary about the environmental damage that had to occur for Gibbs to go on his drive – it is not mentioned. Nor is it about the harm from fossil fuels.\nIt is about why renewable energy is bad. I used to work in the renewable energy industry – first, with wind farms and later in research, government agencies and advocacy groups. So it was hard to resist both watching and reviewing this one, considering it launched on ‘Earth Day’, and it has been widely promoted.\nNot only is the documentary bad, it’s old bad. Please join me on this journey back in time. It won’t be fun, but I’m glad you’re here with me.\nAll of the stuff in this documentary is ancient\nIt is clear that Gibbs has been trying to make this documentary for a long, long time.\n“He is currently working on a film about the state of the planet and the fate of humanity”, read his bio, in 2012. It is clear, digging into these early posts, that he very passionately loathes the burning of trees to generate energy – a wildly controversial and genuinely problematic thing, for sure.\nBut as early as 2010, Gibbs was posting HuffPost blogs extending that into wind and solar, too.\nThis one, for instance, repeats a bog-standard list of anti-wind and anti-solar memes that, back in 2010, were fashionable among climate deniers. The ‘wind and solar are too intermittent’ meme, for instance, is a great hallmark of that era. “How much variable energy can a grid accept? Around ten percent, twenty percent tops it appears”, he wrote back then. I’d include examples of grids with higher percentages operating without a hitch today, but it feels almost cruel.\nThe extreme oldness of this documentary stands out. In one instance, he tours a solar farm in Lansing, Michigan, in which a bemused official states that a large farm can only power ten homes in a year.\nIt is the Cedar Street Solar Array, a 150 kilowatt 824 (that’s small) panel farm in downtown Lansing. Guess when that bad boy was built? 2008. Twelve years ago – an absolute eternity, in solar development years.\nAs PV Magazine writes, “The film reports on a solar installation in Michigan with PV panels rated at “just under 8 percent” conversion efficiency. It’s difficult to identify the brand of panel in the film (Abound?) — but that efficiency is from another solar era”. Efficiency gains in solar have been so rapid that by leaving the dates off his footage he is very actively deceiving the audience. The site generates 64-64 MWh a year, according to the owner – a more recent installation in the same area generates around 436. The footage really is from another era. It’s like doing a documentary on the uselessness of mobile phones but only examining the Motorola Ultrasleek.\nLater, they visit the Solar Energy Generating System (SEGS) solar farm, only to feign sadness and shock when they discover it’s been removed, leaving a dusty field of sand. In the desert. “Then Ozzie and I discovered that the giant solar arrays had been razed to the ground”, he moans. “It suddenly dawned on me what we were looking at. A solar dead zone”.\nWhich is a weird one, because the latest 2020 satellite imagery shows a site full of solar arrays, and a total absence of any “dead zones”. The damn thing is generating electricity.\nWelcome to…………………the DEAD ZONE\nWithout knowing when the footage was taken, the only likely explanation for this is the pair of dudes visited the site midway through the point at which one of the fields was being removed and replaced with newer models, something which has happened several times over the past few decades.\nIn a red flag for any veteran of the wind farm debate, Gibbs then uses footage of a collection of old wind turbines – rusted, gross and horrible – to illustrate the short life and lasting damage of these huge spiky bastards.\nIf you’re familiar with the network of anti-wind farm groups, you’ll recognise that they’re old machines from South Point on Big Island, Hawaii. They were removed in 2012, by the owner of the facility. All that is left now are small hexagonal pads on farmland used by the cattle that roam it:\n“Why for most of my life, have I fallen for the illusion that green energy would save us?” It sounds like he’s saying this in 2020, but he is saying it well in the past. Gibbs was posting anti-wind memes roughly 23 full epidemics ago.\nNothing in this is new. With regards to its wind and solar parts, it smacks of 2010s era climate change denial, in which renewables were seen by detractors as expensive, wasteful, low-capacity, heavily corporatised and destined to fail. Things are different in 2020, but the director isn’t. He doesn’t need to be.\nEven the ideas are old\nPutting aside the sites they visit and the footage they use, there are some ideas in this documentary that are well worn and highly recognisable memes from the 2009 – 2013 climate denial wonder years.\nYou can tell when someone’s knowledge of this has formed solely from doing a Google search for “solar panels bad don’t like”, and it really shows in this film.\nEarly on in the documentary, Gibbs has an exchange with an anti-wind farm protester about coal-fired power:\nProtester: You need to have a fossil fuel power plant backing it up and idling 100% of the time, because if you cycle up or cycle down as the demand on the wind comes through, you actually generate a bigger carbon footprint if you ran it straight”\nGibbs: Do you ever go to things where they just go “Oh, that’s not true, it doesn’t matter we’re going to have a smart grid”?\nProtester: Doesn’t make any difference, they still gotta– they’re using it. You gotta have it idling. Because, let’s just say the wind stopped right now. Just stopped for an hour. You’ve got to have that power\nThis extremely silly concept – that coal-fired power stations run at 100% capacity all the time regardless of how much power they output – is so old it hurts my brain. In fact, it was big in 2012, when I came across it in Australian media. It’s wrong. If the power plant generates less electricity, it uses less coal. Gibbs is putting this eight-year-old meme in the microwave and serving it up in for his audience.\nLater, he presents the work of a researcher named Richard York, who claims that the addition of renewable energy has no impact on fossil fuel output. I can’t access the paper, which is from – you guessed it – 2012, but the premise is mind-numbingly silly.\nElectric grids match supply and demand at all times. Energy generated from one new source has to replace energy generated from an existing source – the grid would collapse, if it didn’t. That is why South Australia’s grid looks like this:\nVia OpenNEM\nAnd Denmark looks like this:\nI made this chart for this\nThings start to get into proper, outright, anti-vax / climate denier grade misinformation when producer Ozzie Zehner comes in.\n“One of the most dangerous things right now is the illusion that alternative technologies like solar and wind are somehow different from fossil fuels”, he tells Gibbs. “You use more fossil fuels to do this than you’re getting benefit from it. You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels in the first place, instead of playing pretend” .\nIt is, in fact, possible to scientifically examine the emissions associated with making, transporting and erecting renewable energy, and compare it to the emissions saved by using it. There are just so many studies on this, but here’s the Breakthrough Institute’s Zeke Hausfather.\nIt’s important to be really clear about this: Zehner’s remarks in this film are toxic misinformation, on par with the worst climate change deniers. No matter which way you look at it, there is no chance that these projects lead to a net increase in emissions.\nGibbs attends a solar conference – again in some non-specific year – and is told by a bunch of obviously well-meaning and slightly baffled young renewable energy experts (literally the only young, diverse people in the film) that battery storage is a way of managing intermittency.\n“When I looked up how much battery storage there is, it was less than one-tenth of one percent of what’s needed”, he says, presenting a pie chart (augh) of IEA data with a minuscule slice from batteries. But grid scale of batteries doesn’t need massive capacities to be functionally useful for managing the integration of renewables – so it’s a deeply misleading chart.\nIn checking the information, I can’t find International Energy Agency data for “51 giga BTU” of battery capacity anywhere on their site. 546,000,000 “Giga BTUs” is 546,000,000,000,000 BTUs. which is 160,032,600,000,000 watt hours, or around 160,000 terawatt hours.\nThis is ‘primary energy supply’ – how much energy was generated, but includes the quantity of energy wasted through inefficiency. If you only look at global annual electricity – the field in which batteries play – it’s around 20,000 TWh (they use a similar deception for Germany’s biomass share). So it’s an extra dodgy comparison.\nGibbs has created a self-sustaining argument here. If someone builds a battery storage installation, he can visit the site and monotone sadly about its presence. If someone decides to not build that battery, he can look up the statistics and monotone sadly about the lack of battery capacity.\nIn an earlier scene, at the launch of the General Motors Chevy Volt (2010, of course), he complains that the cars are being charged by the coal-sodden electric grid of that state – another great example of the infinite loop Gibbs has created for himself, considering his reaction if more wind and solar were built to make that electricity cleaner.\nThere’s gas, too. They repeatedly claim that shutting down coal plants results in replacement with gas. And in the US, gas has indeed expanded to fill a decent proportion of the gap left by coal:\nThe UK has a similar thing too, where both renewables and gas are squeezing out coal. But scroll back up to Denmark, above, where a combination of interconnection with other countries, massive wind build-out and coal and gas shutdown has cleaned up the grid. Or Germany, where gas output remains unchanged as coal plants shut down.\nThere is nothing inherent to renewable energy that makes gas compulsory. All that matter is how the transition is managed. For a long time, gas was sold as a transition fuel, including by organisations like the Breakthrough Institute. But it is becoming increasingly clear that while it might ease change, it isn’t compulsory, and the urgency of decarbonisation has increased.\nThis film is a long, slow painful monument to laziness\nIt feels so weird writing about these things again. I feel like I’ve been transported back in time ten years, back to my early days in the renewable energy industry. We’d combat these viral memes every single day.\nThe industry looks different now. Many wind companies have learnt that insensitive, clumsy development leads to backlash that is harmful for everyone, so they’ve started to clean up their act. Solar developers are figuring out more sustainable pathways than the boom and bust of government subsidies. The human rights issues around mining and materials are becoming more prominent. Renewable companies are taking waste removal seriously.\nAnd then this documentary comes along – a dumb old bull in the china shop that is 2020’s hard-earned climate action environment. There’s a lot of fragile, hard-fought stuff to wreck in there, and Gibbs goes absolutely wild. He’s bulldozing a lot of hard work.\nGibbs obviously has a long-running gripe with biomass, which has a whole range of serious issues associated with it. Though I don’t know the industry well, I suspect many of his gripes there are valid.\nBut the outright lies about wind and solar are serious and extremely harmful. Wind and solar aren’t just technological tools with enormous potential for decarbonisation. They also have massive potential to be owned by communities, deployed at small scales with minimal environmental harm, and removed with far less impact on where they were than large power stations like coal and gas. They do incredible things to electricity bills, they decentralise power (literally and figuratively), and with more work they can be scaled up to properly replace fossil fuels.\nGibbs isn’t interested in this stuff. No one in 2012 was. He’s armed with a list of dot points from climate denier blog Watts Up With That, and he’s ready to go. The key harm of this documentary is that it does what so many communicators struggle, but fail to do – it presents ideas from one ideological cluster into the world of another. It is very actively and successfully escaping the ‘bubble’, and selling far-right, climate-denier myths from nearly a decade ago to left-wing environmentalists in the 2020s, and going by much of the comments, it seems to be doing well. Gibbs is transcending both time and ideological space, held aloft by a system that provides prominence to mediocrity.\nIt’s tough to look past how popular this has been. The film’s been boosted because many interviews feature the popular and well-known producer Michael Moore, including on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show. Ludicrously, it received four stars (four. fucking. stars.) in the Guardian, a media outlet normally careful to not boost climate-denier grade misinformation.\nAll this prominence despite the fact that the film failed to find a distributor, and was dumped onto Youtube instead. “We’ve talked to sales agents. We believe that there will be a tremendous amount of interest in this film… This is going to get distributed. It will be seen”, Moore insisted last year.\nIt is clear that Gibbs’ starting point was a loathing of biomass, which then turned into a loathing of every single decarbonisation technology (except nuclear power, which isn’t mentioned in the film).\nBut he ends up at population control – a cruel, evil and racist ideology that you can see coming right from the start of the film. I wish I had the emotional energy to go into it, but I have spent it all. Earther’s Brian Kahn writes:\n“There’s a reason that Breitbart and other conservative voices aligned with climate denial and fossil fuel companies have taken a shine to the film. It’s because it ignores the solution of holding power to account and sounds like a racist dog whistle”\nThe film features a parade of – solely – white Americans, mostly male, insisting the planet has to reduce its population. There is no information provided on which people in the world need to stop fucking, but we can take a guess, based on the demographics of the people doing the asking.\nThis documentary – particularly the parts on energy, renewables and industry- is extremely bad. It is Jeff Gibb’s 2010 Huffington Post blog drawn out in one hour and forty minutes, which feels like like a decade. I knew it would be lazy, but the magnitude of laziness here is incredible. It it mostly old. It is obviously re-hashing some specific gripes, like its attacks on the nicest guy in the whole of climate activism, Bill McKibben. I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface and I’m like 2,000 words in. I don’t have the energy to glue together every single fragile thing that this bulldozer has destroyed.\nIt is the ultimate expression of lazy privilege to make something so void of effort, but so widely viewed and promoted. Criticism will be rebuffed as Not Being Able To Handle The Truth, or the classic We Just Wanted To Start A Discussion. It is still a package of old, dead ideas reheated by someone who knew that he did not need to put any effort into updating his thinking. There was no chance he would be talking to climate activists, talking to young people, talking to experts, talking to community advocates, talking to people from other countries, or really talking to anyone who wasn’t already mostly in his vicinity.\nIt should have faded off into the pit of Youtube’s unwatched terabytes, but it didn’t, because mediocrity is celebrated, boosted and broadcast if it comes from someone who looks and sounds the right way. That is a serious vulnerability. The hard work of climate and energy advocates, as they grapple with challenges like corporate malfeasance, the impacts of mining and bad development can be shattered by the monotone arrogance of a single person inflicted with the Dunning Kruger effect.\nSomber music."

   "title": "Coronavirus conspiracy theories are dangerous – here’s how to stop them spreading",
   "paragraph": "Coronavirus conspiracy theories are dangerous – here’s how to stop them spreading\nPosted on 27 April 2020 by Stephan Lewandowsky, John Cook\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.\nThe number of coronavirus infections and deaths continues to rise at an alarming rate, reminding us that this crisis is far from over. In response, the global scientific community has thrown itself at the problem and research is unfolding at an unprecedented rate.\nThe new virus was identified, along with its natural origins, and tests for it were rapidly developed. Labs across the world are racing to develop a vaccine, which is estimated to be still around 12 to 18 months away.\nAt the same time, the pandemic has been accompanied by an infodemic of nonsense, disinformation, half-truths and conspiracy theories that have spread virally through social networks. This damages society in a variety of ways. For example, the myth that COVID-19 is less dangerous than the seasonal flu was deployed by US president Donald Trump as justification for delaying mitigation policies.\nThe recent downgrading of COVID-19 death projections, which reveal the success of social-distancing policies, has been falsely used to justify premature relaxing of social distancing measures. This is the logical equivalent of throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because it’s kept you dry until then.\nThis article is part of the Expert guide to conspiracy theories, a series by The Conversation’s The Anthill podcast. Listen here, on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or search for The Anthill wherever you get your podcasts.\nThe new conspiracy theory that blames COVID-19 on the 5G broadband system is one of the most bizarre pieces of misinformation. There are several strains of this theory, ranging from the claims that 5G alters people’s immune systems to the idea that 5G changes people’s DNA, making them more susceptible to infection. Then there’s the idea that secret messages about 5G and coronavirus were hidden in the design of the new £20 note in the UK. In reality, 5G relates to viruses and bank notes as much as the tooth fairy relates to zoology – not at all.\nThe 5G conspiracy theory originated in early March when an American physician, Thomas Cowan, proposed it in a YouTube video (which has since been taken down by YouTube according to their new policy). Some people have taken this conspiracy theory so seriously that it led to people setting 5G towers in the UK on fire and threatening broadband engineers.\nThe conspiracy theory has begun to penetrate mainstream society. Among other celebrities, UK TV personality Eamonn Holmes and US actor Woody Harrelson have given fuel to the idea.\nInoculating against conspiracy theories\nAs we document in our recent Conspiracy Theory Handbook, there is a great deal of scientific research into why people might be susceptible to conspiracy theories. When people suffer loss of control or feel threatened, it makes them more vulnerable to believing conspiracies. Unfortunately, this means that pandemics have always been breeding grounds for conspiracy theories, from antisemitic hysteria during the Black Death to today’s 5G craze.\nAn effective strategy for preventing conspiracy theories from spreading through social networks is, appropriately enough, inoculation. As we document in the Conspiracy Theory Handbook, if we inoculate the public by pre-emptively warning them of misleading misinformation, they develop resilience and are less likely to be negatively influenced. Inoculating messages can take several forms. As well as giving people the right facts, inoculation can also be logic-based and source-based.\nQuestioning the sources\nThe source-based approach focuses on analysing the people who push the conspiracy theory and the cultural infrastructure from which they emerged.\nFor example, the 5G theory began with Thomas Cowan, a physician whose medical licence is on a five-year probation. He is currently prohibited from providing cancer treatment to patients and supervising physician assistants and advanced practice nurses. So we can question his credentials.\nHis 5G video was from a talk he presented at a pseudo-scientific conference featuring a who’s who of science deniers. One of the headliners was Andrew Wakefield, a debarred former physician and seminal figure in the anti-vaccination movement who promotes highly damaging misinformation about vaccination based on data that he is known to have falsified.\nAnother attendee of this meeting was the president of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, an organisation famous for bestowing awards onto fossil-fuel funded climate deniers and for giving a platform to a speaker who denied the link between HIV and AIDS, claiming that the link was invented by government scientists who wanted to cover up other health risks of “the lifestyle of homosexual men.”\nFor the public to be protected against the 5G conspiracy theory, it is important to understand its emergence from the same infrastructure that also supports AIDS denial, anti-vaccination conspiracies and climate denial.\nIt is therefore unsurprising that the rhetorical techniques that are deployed against the seriousness of climate change are similar to those used to mismanage the COVID-19 crisis.\nYale Climate Connections, Author provided\nQuestioning the logic\nAnother way to neutralise conspiracy theories is through logic-based inoculation. This involves explaining the rhetorical techniques and tell-tale traits to be found in misinformation, so that people can flag it before it has a chance to mislead them. In the Conspiracy Theory Handbook, we document seven traits of conspiratorial thinking. Spotting these can help people identify a baseless theory.\nConspiracy Theory Handbook, Author provided\nOne trait that is particularly salient in the 5G conspiracy theory is re-interpreting randomness. With this thought pattern, random events are re-interpreted as being causally connected and woven into a broader, interconnected pattern.\nFor example, the introduction of 5G in 2019 coincided with the origin of COVID-19 and hence is interpreted to be causally related. But by that logic, other factors that were introduced in 2019 – say, the global phenomenon of Baby Yoda – could also be interpreted as a possible cause of COVID-19. Correlation does not equal causation. The 5G conspiracy theory is also immune to evidence, despite having been debunked extensively. To illustrate, some of the countries worst affected by the pandemic (such as Iran) do not have any 5G technology.\nOf course, 5G has nothing to do with a virus. In the US, T-Mobile’s low-band 5G data is transmitted using old UHF TV channels. UHF TV did not cause coronavirus and neither does 5G.\nJohn Cook, Author provided\nThe crucial role of social media platforms\nSocial media platforms contribute to the problem of misinformation by providing the means for it to quickly and freely disseminate to the general public. Given that 330,000 lives were lost in relation to AIDS in South Africa during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki, when denying the disease’s link to HIV was official state policy. Given that people in the UK are now vandalizing potentially life-saving communication infrastructure, social media companies should not aid and abet the life-threatening disinformation that is spewed by a nexus of science deniers and conspiracy theorists.\nTo their credit, these firms are making an effort to be part of the solution to the problem of misinformation. For example, YouTube has announced that it will take down any video that espouses the 5G conspiracy theory. This is a move in the right direction.\nThere is considerable room for improvement, however. A recent test by the non-profit Disinfo.eu laboratory found much conspiratorial content on various social media platforms, and we were able to find hundreds of YouTube videos promulgating the 5G nonsense with a few keystrokes.\nMuch remains to be done."

   "paragraph": "State of the climate: First quarter of 2020 is second warmest on record\nPosted on 24 April 2020 by Zeke Hausfather\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief\nThis year is shaping up to be one of the warmest years on record – if not the warmest. This is particularly noteworthy because 2020 is likely to see neutral El Niño/La Niña conditions that will play little-to-no role in boosting annual temperatures.\nThe first three months of 2020 were the second warmest on record, behind only the super-El Niño-fuelled 2016. The past 12 months were also nearly tied for the warmest 12-month period on record. Near-record sea surface temperatures have driven extensive coral bleaching during the southern hemisphere summer.\nGlobal temperatures are currently running at or above the level projected by the generation of climate models featured in the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5).\nGlobal sea level continues to rise in 2020. This is being driven by melting glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of water as it warms. Arctic sea ice currently is on the low end of its historical range after seeing the joint-second lowest minimum Arctic sea ice extent on record in 2019, while Antarctic sea ice is closer to normal levels for this time of year.\nSecond warmest start to a year\nGlobal surface temperatures are recorded and reported by a number of different international groups, including NASA, NOAA, Met Office Hadley Centre/UEA, Berkeley Earth and Cowtan and Way. Copernicus/ECMWF also produces a surface temperature estimate based on a combination of measurements and a weather model – an approach known as “reanalysis”.\nThe chart below compares the annual global surface temperatures from these different groups since 1970 – or 1979 in the case of Copernicus/ECMWF. The coloured lines show the temperature for each year, while the dots on the right-hand side show the year-to-date estimate for January to March 2020. Values are shown relative to a common baseline period – the 1981-2010 average temperature for each series. Surface temperature records have shown around 0.9C warming since the year 1970, a warming rate of about 0.18C per decade.\nYear-to-date values are only shown for NASA, NOAA, and Copernicus as data for March is not yet available from the other groups. The year-to-date values in this chart will be updated when that data becomes available.\nAnnual global mean surface temperatures from NASA GISTEMP, NOAA GlobalTemp, Hadley/UEA HadCRUT4, Berkeley Earth, Cowtan and Way and Copernicus/ECMWF (lines), along with 2020 temperatures to-date (January-March, coloured dots). Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1981-2010 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nThe temperatures in the first three months of 2020 were remarkably warm. If they end up being representative of the entire year, then 2020 will set a clear record as the warmest year. However, it is likely that global temperatures will not be quite as warm for the remainder of the year – in part because global temperatures are more variable during the October-March period than the April-September period due to El Niño events tending to peak in the winter.\nThe figure below shows how temperatures to-date compare to prior years in the NASA dataset. It shows the temperature of the year-to-date for each month of the year, from January through to the full annual average.\nYear-to-date temperatures for each month from 2012 to 2020 from NASA GISTEMP. Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1981-2010 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nDespite its unusually high temperatures during the first three months, 2020 is still running behind 2016 in terms of year-to-date (Q1) temperatures. The winter months were particularly warm in 2016 – 0.89C above the 1981-2010 average in the NASA GISTEMP dataset. (Summer temperature anomalies in 2016 were notably cooler, resulting in an annual average temperature anomaly of 0.60C.) By comparison, the first three months of 2020 had a temperature anomaly of 0.78C, putting it solidly in second place.\nHowever, the start of 2016 was boosted substantially by an extremely strong El Niño event, whereas in comparison, late 2019 and early 2020 have seen neutral sea surface temperature conditions in the Pacific Ocean.\nEl Niño and La Niña events – collectively referred to as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, or ENSO – are the main driver of year-to-year variation on top of the long-term surface warming trend. ENSO events are characterised by fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific, which help to make some years warmer and some cooler.\nThe majority of forecasts for El Niño/La Niña suggest neutral conditions will persist for the remainder of 2020, with sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific around between -0.5C and 0.5C from the recent average.\nThis can be seen in the figure below, which shows a range of ENSO forecast models produced by different scientific groups, with the average for each type of models shown by thick red, blue and green lines. Positive values above 0.5C reflect El Niño conditions, while negative values below -0.5 reflect La Niña conditions.\nEl Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecast models for three-month periods in the Niño3.4 region (February, March, April – FMA – and so on), taken from the IRI/CPC ENSO forecast.\nClimate models and observations\nClimate models provide physics-based estimates of future warming given different assumptions about future emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations and other climate-influencing factors.\nModel estimates of temperatures prior to 2005 are a “hindcast” using known past climate influences, while temperatures projected after 2005 are a “forecast” based on an estimate of how things might change.\nThe figure below shows the range of individual models forecasts featured in the IPCC’s AR5 – known collectively as the CMIP5 models – between 1970 and 2020 with grey shading and the average projection across all the models shown in black. Individual observational temperature records are represented by coloured lines.\n12-month average global average surface temperatures from CMIP5 models and observations between 1970 and 2020. Models use RCP4.5 forcings after 2005. They include sea surface temperatures over oceans and surface air temperatures over land to match what is measured by observations. Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1981-2010 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nWhile global temperatures were running a bit below the pace of warming projected by climate models between 2005 and 2014, the last few years have been pretty close to the model average. This is particularly true for globally-complete temperature records such as NASA, Berkeley Earth and the Copernicus reanalysis that include temperature estimates for the full Arctic region.\nTemperatures were warmer than the multimodel average during the 2015-16 super-El Niño event and were a bit cooler during the 2018 La Niña. In the past two years temperature have ticked back upwards, and are currently above the multimodel average in most of the datasets.\nNotably, temperatures over the prior 12-month period (April 2019-March 2020) are close behind the August 2015-September 2016 period in being the warmest 12-months on record, particularly in the Copernicus/ECMWF dataset.\nPredicting 2020 temperatures\nThe first three months of 2020 can give some sense of what to expect for the entire year. By looking at the relationship between the first three months and the annual temperatures for every year since 1950, Carbon Brief has created a projection of what the final global average temperature for 2020 may turn out to be. The analysis also estimates the large uncertainty in 2020 outcomes, given that temperatures from only three months of the year are available so far.\nThe figure below shows the results of Carbon Brief’s analysis using the NASA GISTemp dataset. The yellow dot shows the average 2020 temperature over the first three months, while the red square shows the most likely 2020 annual temperature estimate. The error bars surrounding it indicate the 95% confidence interval – namely, there’s a 95% likelihood that the 2020 global average temperature will fall in this range.\nAnnual global average surface temperature anomalies from NASA plotted with respect to a 1981-2010 baseline. To-date 2020 values include January-March. Estimated 2020 annual value based on relationship between the January-March temperatures and annual temperatures since 1950. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nThis analysis suggests that the full 2020 annual temperatures will likely be notably below the year-to-date temperatures. At this point it is extremely likely that 2020 will be one of the Top 4 warmest years on record, and there is a real chance that it might beat 2016 to set the record as the warmest year. Most projections made at the start of 2020 – such as those from NASA GISTEMP and the UK Met Office – suggest that the year will end up as the second warmest after 2016.\nSea levels continue to rise\nModern-day sea levels rose to a new high in late 2019 and early 2020, due to a combination of melting land ice – glaciers and ice sheets – and the thermal expansion of water as it warms.\nThe figure below shows the increase in global sea level since it was first measured by satellites in the early 1990s. The different coloured lines indicate different satellite missions over the years. Earlier sea level data from tide gauges is also available, with data going back to the late 1800s.\nGlobal average sea level based on satellite data from January 1993 to present from NOAA. A correction for global average isostatic rebound of 0.3mm/yr is added. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nSea level rise is sensitive to global surface temperatures; El Niño years where temperatures are a bit warmer tend to have more rapid sea level rise than La Niña years. For example, sea level increased rapidly from 2014 to 2016. However, these are relatively small fluctuations around the consistent long-term trend. Overall sea levels have risen around 90mm since the early 1990s, and around 200mm since 1900.\nSea level data is corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment – the rebound of the Earth from the several kilometre-thick ice sheets that covered much of North America and Europe around 20,000 years ago. This adjustment is relatively small, only adding around 0.3mm/yr to sea level rise rates, or around 10% of the current rate of sea level rise.\nArctic sea ice moderately low\nArctic sea ice spent much of early 2020 at the low end of the historical 1979-2010 range, but above record lows seen in early 2019. Antarctic sea ice was close to the long-term average over the first three months of 2020. Reliable sea ice coverage data is only available since polar-observing satellites were launched in the late 1970s.\nThe figure below shows both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent in 2020 (solid red and blue lines), the historical range in the record between 1979 and 2010 (shaded areas) and the record lows (dotted black line). Unlike global temperature records, sea ice data is collected and updated on a daily basis, allowing sea ice extent to be viewed through to the present.\nArctic and Antarctic daily sea ice extent from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. The bold lines show daily 2020 values, the shaded area indicates the two standard deviation range in historical values between 1979 and 2010. The dotted black lines show the record lows for each pole. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nSea ice extent only tells part of the story. In addition to declining ice extent, the sea ice that remains tends to be younger and thinner than ice that used to cover the region. The figure below, using data from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS), shows the Arctic sea ice thickness for every year between 1979 and 2020. While sea ice volume was quite low in 2019, it has recovered modestly in early 2020, but is still in-line with the long-term downward trend.\nArctic sea-ice volume anomalies from 1979 through March 2020 from PIOMAS."

   "paragraph": "Our extraordinary 50th Earth Day\nPosted on 23 April 2020 by Bud Ward\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections.\nHappy 50th anniversary of Earth Day.\nWell, sort of anyway, “happy” being a relative term in these extraordinarily turbulent times.\nThis no doubt will be the strangest Earth Day: Each day since the start of the global coronavirus pandemic took hold may qualify as the strangest … until tomorrow comes.\nThat said, past Earth Days have brought together large assemblies of persons across the globe to celebrate our planet and fight for its continued wellbeing. None of that this year, please, other than digitally and with all due respect for the critical need for physical and social distancing. (Think Andrea Bocelli singing “Amazing Grace” in an empty courtyard in front of Milan’s Duomo Cathedral this past Easter Day.)\nIn the personal confines sequestering many of us this April 22, it will be important to acknowledge some inarguable conclusions:\nWe wouldn’t want to be living today in the environment of a United States that has not benefited from the environmental, conservation, and pollution control efforts triggered at the start of the ’70s by then-President Richard M. Nixon and his January 1 declaration of “the environmental decade.”\nPicture our current 328+ million people and the air we would be breathing today were it not for the extraordinary progress made under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Remember days of “headlights at noon” ranging from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles? No thank you.\nOr picture the water quality of our endless rivers, lakes, and streams were it not for the gains made under the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act (AKA Clean Water Act). “Don’t come in, the water’s foul!” we’d be urging.\nOr recall the so-called potable water that was being swept down the Mississippi River to folks in New Orleans. Kentucky’s best bourbons couldn’t have sufficed to make it worth tasting.\nEndangered species? Wild and scenic rivers? Endless strip mining and “mountain top removal” (a euphemism for sure), “Right to know,” pervasive and random application of all sorts of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and more? Major federal laws on each were enacted in that first decade of Earth Days.\nAnd that short listing doesn’t even begin to acknowledge the victories gained – the pollution and environmental degradation avoided – as a result of the January 1970 enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act, with its provisions for environmental impact statements. A modern world without NEPA? I’d rather not, thanks.\nNone of which, by the way, is intended to suggest that any of those statutes, nor the vast and complex implementing regulations under them, are “perfect.” Far from it. Nor does it suggest that the battles are won, the gains so far achieved irreversible. Farther still. Created as they were by fallible beings, working always in a political and imperfect system, valid criticisms apply across the board. Overly litigious? Check. In some cases convoluted and imprecise? Got it. Idealistically ambitious in some cases (think “zero discharge” by 1977 under the Water Act)? True. Shortcomings abound.\nBut that’s OK, and in the end a tribute to and not a criticism of these five decades of accomplishment and aspiration since Earth Day One.\nAnd oh, the ironies. This year’s Earth Day will be observed throughout much of the U.S. and the world in a period of unusually clean air and clear skies, distant horizons now visible in the absence of the smog and air pollution long endured in many places as being normal. Think here of a New Delhi resident’s for the first time seeing the majesty of the Himalayas, the smog temporarily abated. Those air pollutants, as with those responsible for global warming, are diminished substantially, but certainly only temporarily: They’re gone as a result of the dearth now of what many have now come to abide, however reluctantly, as “normal,” the detritus from routine air and highway miles traveled daily by millions domestically and billions worldwide.\nThe cleaner air bonanza afforded us by the constraints imposed by the coronavirus realities – SPOILER ALERT: another irony here – comes during the tenure of what must clearly be regarded as the single most anti-environmental presidential administration of any in U.S. history. That characterization applies to, and beyond, the highly controversial targeted evisceration of regulations and policies aimed over the past three-plus years specifically at the preceding administration’s climate change efforts. But it applies nowhere more than in the climate change context. And that’s notwithstanding this President’s protestations to the contrary, including his saying he is “an environmentalist.” That clearly is – what does one call it? – “fake news.”\nIt will be ironic too, won’t it, if year-end official atmospheric data show calendar year 2020 to have measured the most progress in reducing carbon dioxide emissions? Or perhaps even if data at the end of this administration’s tenure show major declines in greenhouse gas emissions? The irony is gobsmacking but the likelihood highly possible. Prepare for it.\nIn the end, this 50th Earth Day will come. And go. That much is clear. What is far less clear at this point is the potential impact, physically and psychologically, that the eventual post-coronavirus era will have on public and political attitudes toward addressing the climate challenges still confronting the planet. Will the 60th, or 70th, or even centennial celebration of Earth Day find the coronavirus lessons fully learned and applied to climate change? Will the global climate by then have been healed, or still ailing and even far more so?\nPerhaps, just perhaps, the world’s people and their leaders at all levels will have come together well before then to confront and overcome the perils of global warming, just as they certainly must come together soon to defeat coronavirus.\nIf only doing so were as simple and as straightforward as developing and providing a vaccine."

Credit: Mark Von Holden/WireImage\nDenis Hayes was a 25-year-old graduate student at Harvard University when he read about a Wisconsin Senator, Gaylord Nelson, who was planning to organize an environmental teach-in on college campuses.\nHayes hightailed it to Washington, D.C., hoping to convince Nelson to let him organize a teach-in at Harvard, and maybe other colleges in and around Boston. Two days later, Hayes dropped out of the John F. Kennedy School of Government to coordinate a national event, \"Earth Day.\"\nThe day made history. The rest is environmental history, one that neither Hayes nor Nelson even expected.\nOn the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, climate change, deforestation and chemical-intensive agriculture had yet to become existential crises. The issue was pollution, the day a call to action to protect precious resources—-air, water, land and all living things—-from the encroaching toxins of industrial society. That proved enough to draw a crowd.\nTwenty million people—10 percent of the population of the United States at the time—-participated in rallies and events from coast to coast that day. Thousands of colleges and universities joined in with organized protests. School children planted trees, swept streets and picked up trash on beaches. What came after changed the world. By the end of 1970, Earth Day had led to the creation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species acts.\nQ&A: Denis Hayes, Planner of the First Earth Day, Discusses the ‘Virtual’ 50th by Evelyn Nieves, InsideClimate News, Apr 17, 2020\nEditorial of the Week...\nIn an Era of Pandemics and Fires, Global Action Is the Only Hope\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, where the coronavirus is now eclipsing the dangers of drought and fire, the new pandemic is the starkest reminder yet of how connected we all are.

Credit: Shelly Rivoli/Alamy\nThe fifth-most-read article published in the last decade by Orion, the literary environmental quarterly, is a 2012 essay called “State of the Species,⁠” by science writer Charles C. Mann. When I read it a few months ago, my worldview changed.\nIt’s an 8,000-word essay that should be read in its entirety, so I’ll just summarize its most salient, crushing point. Homo sapiens has been an unusually successful animal, but “the fate of every successful animal is to wipe itself out.” For example, the population of protozoans in a petri dish stocked with water and nutrients rises, slowly at first, then explosively, until they use up the dish’s resources or drown in their waste. Then their population crashes.\nThe problem for humans is that our population growth very much resembles the protozoans’. For the first 100,000 years of homo sapiens’ 200,000 years on Earth, humans struggled to survive. Then our population began to grow, slowly at first, far more rapidly after the invention of agriculture 10,000 years ago, exponentially in the last couple of centuries — we’ve become a prototypically “successful” species. (Here’s a startling visual representation⁠ of this fact.) But if humans follow the protozoan path, we’ll run out of necessities like food and water or we’ll be engulfed in the consequences of our carbon dioxide emissions, and our population will plummet.cv\nIn an Era of Pandemics and Fires, Global Action Is the Only Hope by Jacques Leslie, Letters from California, Yale Environment 360, Apr 2, 2020\nToon of the Week...\nHat tip to the Stop Climate Denial Denial Facebook page.\nComing Soon on SkS...\nExtra Warming?

   "title": "Coronavirus doubters follow climate denial playbook",
   "paragraph": "Coronavirus doubters follow climate denial playbook\nPosted on 14 April 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nFor the climate community, observing U.S. national political leaders’ responses to the coronavirus pandemic has been like watching the climate crisis unfold on fast-forward. Many – particularly on the political right – have progressed through the same five stages of science denial in the face of both threats.\nFor climate change, the denial process began decades ago. NASA climate scientist James Hansen testified to Congress in 1988 about the dangers posed by global warming; the fossil fuel industry formed the Global Climate Coalition the very next year to launch a campaign casting doubt on mainstream climate science. In November 1989, President George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff, climate denier John Sununu, sabotaged efforts to develop the first international climate change treaty. Exxon in particular spent the following decades and tens of millions of dollars funding a network of think tanks to propagate climate science denial. In a memo leaked in 2003, Republican strategist Frank Luntz advised G.O.P. politicians, “You need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.”\nAnalysis\nThe same denial process has unfolded with coronavirus, but over a far more compressed time frame. In both crises, early warnings from scientific experts went unheeded and were often discouraged or suppressed. As a result, the American government began responding only after each threat’s impacts had become widespread and undeniable. At that point, due to the missed opportunity to prevent the outbreak of impacts, much of the response came in the form of damage control. America’s efforts to “flatten the curve” of coronavirus cases, like its efforts to bend the carbon emissions curve, were deployed too slowly.\nThe five stages of denial\nIn 2013, as the fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was due to be released, the five stages of climate denial were on display in many conservative media outlets. Watching the reactions to the unfolding coronavirus crisis in early 2020 created a sense of déjà vu, as many leaders exhibited the same stages of denial. In fact, many of the same actors who deny the climate crisis also were (or still are) denying coronavirus threats. Some observers have remarked that the Venn diagram of coronavirus and climate deniers is nearly a circle.\nStage 1: Deny the problem exists. This is denial at its most basic, as there is no need to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. If the issue is a hoax, as the president repeatedly has asserted about both global warming and coronavirus, the status quo can be maintained. But denying a problem doesn’t change its physical or epidemiological properties, so in the face of real scientifically quantified threats, Stage 1 denial cannot last very long.\nStage 2: Deny responsibility. Upon accepting the threat posed by coronavirus outbreaks, numerous conservative politicians and pundits have tried to shift the blame to China, with many including the president labeling it “the Chinese virus,” echoed over 100 times on Fox News. Similarly, after accepting that climate change is happening, many have tried to blame it on natural cycles, or, if they accept humanity’s responsibility, to likewise blame it on China. But here again denial falls short; shifting blame does not slow a physical or viral crisis.\nStage 3: Downplay the threat. President Trump spent weeks downplaying the threat of coronavirus, early maintaining that it had only infected one person in America, that “one day like a miracle it will disappear,” that “within a couple of days [the number of infected Americans] is going to be down to close to zero,” and so on. Fox News and other conservative media outlets followed his lead in downplaying the risks. Similarly, Trump has said the climate “will change back,” and conservative media outlets have spent decades arguing that climate change is no big deal. Yet, as the devastation of coronavirus and climate change impacts has become a reality, doubters have been increasingly forced to move beyond Stage 3 denial.\nStage 4: Attack the solutions as too costly. Trump has claimed that coronavirus curve-flattening measures recommended by experts – like long-term social distancing – are too costly. He instead suggested preemptively loosening social distancing measures to reopen the national economy “sooner rather than later” (an approach Fox News has also championed), as well as various unproven drug treatments, with Fox News again following suit. A number of ideologues have argued that older Americans would rather die than cause the economic disruption associated with extended social distancing. Some partisan policymakers and pundits similarly oppose virtually all large-scale climate solutions as too expensive, instead proposing worthwhile but inadequate steps like simply planting trees or capturing carbon from power plants to inexplicably use for extracting yet more fossil fuels.\nStage 5: It’s too late. Some have proposed, once it became obvious that the coronavirus outbreak had become widespread, that governments should just maintain the status quo, try to build herd immunity, and cope with the consequences (such as overwhelmed health care systems that could result in millions of deaths). Climate justice essayist Mary Heglar coined the term “de-nihilist” to describe those who have similarly succumbed to the fear that it’s too late to stop climate change. Such attitudes only hamper efforts to constructively address both problems.\nCoronavirus is a learning opportunity for climate change\nBecause American leadership proceeded through these stages of denial, it wasted valuable months that could have been spent preparing for and curbing the spread of coronavirus. For comparison, South Korea diagnosed its first case of COVID-19 on January 20 – the same day as the U.S. – but almost immediately launched an aggressive program of testing, tracing, and quarantining.\nBy March, South Korea was conducting over 10,000 coronavirus tests per day, and its new cases fell below 150 per day by mid-March. Despite a population six times larger, the U.S. had reached the threshold of 10,000 new tests per day only on March 16, and has consistently lagged in testing on a per capita basis. As testing in the U.S. finally began to catch up to the viral spread, the number of new coronavirus cases in America accelerated past 10,000 per day by March 23, reaching 580,000, by April 14 compared to 10,564 South Korean cases (222 deaths) as of that date.\nAfter this late start, Trump has regularly argued that the U.S. “cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” Those who oppose climate solutions similarly argue that making investments to bend the carbon emissions curve would be worse than the consequences of climate change – consequences that include increased food insecurity; intensified hurricanes, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, and floods; and more species extinctions, violent conflicts, and death.\nBoth arguments run counter to expert advice, misunderstand the problem, and present a false choice. In reality, failing to make the necessary early investments to head off each threat will result in economy-crippling consequences, whether in the form of overwhelmed health care systems in the case of coronavirus or more deadly extreme weather events in the case of climate change.\nExperts agree that to protect both the economy and public health, government responses must focus on flattening the coronavirus curve and making investments to rapidly curb carbon pollution. In fact, a new study on the 1918 flu pandemic found that measures like social distancing “not only lower mortality, they also mitigate the adverse economic consequences of a pandemic.” Nipping the problem quickly and aggressively yields the best outcome for both the economy and public health. Put simply, suffering and death are costly.\nObserving the damage resulting from denial of both the coronavirus and climate crises raises the question, how did humans evolve this apparent psychological flaw? Physician-scientist Ajit Varki has hypothesized that comprehending one’s own mortality is a psychological evolutionary barrier for most species, because this realization would amplify the fear of death and thus “would have then reduced the reproductive fitness of such isolated individuals.” Varki posits that humans may have overcome this barrier by developing denial as a coping mechanism, but that “If this theory turns out to be the correct explanation for the origin of the species, it might ironically also be now sowing the seeds of our demise,” since denial now obstructs efforts to address threats like climate change and coronavirus.\nAs climate activist and author Bill McKibben put it, “You can’t negotiate with physics and chemistry, you can’t compromise with them or spin them away … coronavirus is teaching us precisely this lesson about biology as well. Reality is real and sometimes it bites pretty hard.” Or, as Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said more bluntly, “Denial is not likely to be a successful strategy for survival.”\nBut because of its compressed time frame, coronavirus has provided humanity an opportunity to learn this lesson and apply it to curbing the worst of the climate crisis. Contrary to Stage 5 denial, it’s not yet too late to avoid the most severe climate change impacts."

   "paragraph": "With climate and coronavirus, 'the broad shape of the story is the same'\nPosted on 13 April 2020 by greenman3610\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\n\"The broad shape of the story is the same.”\nWith those nine words, columnist and 2008 Nobel Prize winner in economics Paul Krugman considers the coronavirus’ climate change issues.\nA regular New York Times columnist, Krugman says in this month’s “This Is Not Cool” video that “we might have dealt with the climate change threat” more effectively “if the political right hadn’t developed its own sort of immune mechanism to evidence.”\nAcknowledging the obvious political tone of that observation, Krugman’s view is seconded by Republican consultant Stuart Stevens, whose public pronouncements identify him clearly as no fan of the Trump administration. Stevens calls in the video for a commitment to “agreed-upon truth” and deplores “alternative facts” and what he sees as “an unprecedented assault on what are facts.”\nA major emphasis in the video is an exploration of exponential growth as it applies both to climate change and to coronavirus infections. Among segments addressing that issue are clips involving a Novi, Mi., nurse, an astrophysicist, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, leading U.S. infectious diseases expert. The video juxtaposes those spokespersons with climate change and coronavirus “skeptics” minimizing risks.\nLessons learned from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and applicable to climate change? Describing those lessons in the video is climate scientist Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University, who says:\n“Listen to the experts” and\n“Taking action early, before it becomes a huge problem, will actually prevent its becoming a huge problem.”"

But in the Arctic Circle the virus is disrupting climate science. It could leave important gaps in our understanding.\nEast GRIP research facility in Greenland\nEvery year 150 climate scientists fly far into the wilderness and bore deep into Greenland's largest glacier. Their work is complicated and important. The EastGRIP project is trying to understand how ice streams underneath the glacier are pushing vast amounts of ice into the ocean, and how this contributes to rising sea levels. But this year the drills will be silent. The ice streams will go unmeasured.\nThe reason is the coronavirus. The fallout from measures to contain the outbreak have made the research impossible. Greenland is closed to foreigners. Its government is worried any outbreak could be particularly dangerous to its indigenous population and rapidly overwhelm its health services.\nEven if the country were open, it just isn't practical to bring an international team of scientists together, 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away from the nearest airport, in case one of them is sick. The transport planes that normally fly in the teams and resupply them have also been grounded. Nobody wants to be responsible for bringing small, isolated communities into contact with the virus.\nCoronavirus puts Arctic climate change research on ice by Alex Matthews, Deutsche Welle (DW), Apr 12, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article.\nFridays For Future News...\nShifting Gears: The Climate Protest Movement in the Age of Coronavirus\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, Fridays for Future, the youth climate campaign, was seeing numbers of protesters decline and its calls for action falling short of its goals. Now, the movement is recalibrating its strategies to try to usher in the next phase of a global campaign.\nYouth climate activists at a Fridays For Future protest in Berlin, Germany on September 20, 2019. MAJA HITIJ/GETTY IMAGES\nFor more than a year, just about every Friday at noon, Invaliden Park in downtown Berlin was transformed into a vivacious, noisy, swarming hubbub with teenage speakers, bands, and live dance acts — as well as Germany’s top climate scientists — all sharing a makeshift stage and a microphone. Several thousand mostly school-age pupils waved banners and placards proclaiming “There is no Planet B,” “School Strike for Climate,” and “We’re on strike until you act!” Their chants against fossil fuels and for swift, decisive action on global warming echoed against the granite facades of the federal ministries for economy and transportation, both adjacent to the square.\nThe happening was the weekly “school strike” in Berlin of Fridays for Future (FFF), the climate crisis movement that began in 2018 with the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg skipping school once a week to protest her country’s half-hearted response to climate change. The movement then ricocheted across the globe, mobilizing school-age young people — in wealthy countries as well as poor — as never before. Last year, the campaign culminated in international demonstrations of millions in cities and towns from Cape Town, South Africa to Anchorage, Alaska, all with the same goal: to force their nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions and become carbon-neutral by 2050.\n“There was a brilliant logic to the school strikes that drew people in,” explains Bill McKibben, author and co-founder of the climate action group 350.org. “If [the adult world] can’t be bothered to prepare a liveable world for me, why should I be bothered to sit in school and prepare for that future?

The streets and highways that run through busy cities around the world are uncharacteristically empty. Schools are closed. Storefronts are boarded up. Many people are just trying to figure out how to survive the COVID-19 pandemic. Preparation is key, says epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo. But that doesn’t mean stockpiling paper goods and cleaning supplies. Each country needs to be prepared, and it is now clear that many were not.\nNuzzo’s work at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has focused on pandemics and outbreaks. Less than three months before the earliest reported case of humans infected with COVID-19, Nuzzo and her colleagues published a WHO/World Bank-commissioned report about a “high-impact respiratory pathogen” that “would likely have significant public health, economic, social, and political consequences.” What we’re experiencing now, she says, exceeds “some of the grimmest expectations” highlighted in that report.\nStill, Nuzzo sees a light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel. In our interview, she explained why vaccines aren’t the answer, how the novel coronavirus is unique, and what we can do to keep ourselves healthy. A supporter of social distancing, Nuzzo spoke to me from the protection of her home in Maryland, where she, like many of us, is balancing remote work with homeschooling two young kids.\nJennifer Nuzzo: “We’re Definitely Not Overreacting” to COVID-19 by Yvonne Bang, JSTOR Daily, Apr 6, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article.\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\nSun, Apr 5, 2020\nA classic 'Twilight Zone' episode warns us how not to behave during a pandemic by& Blake, CNN, Apr 4, 2020\nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it? by Graham Readfearn, Environmental Investigations, Guardian Australia, Apr 4, 2020\nAware, confused, leaderless: How Irish people feel about climate change now by Ian McShane, Life & Style, Irish Times, Apr 4, 2020\nBig Oil is using the coronavirus pandemic to push through the Keystone XL pipeline, Opinion by Bill McKibben, Comment is Free, Guardian, Apr 5, 2020\nPrepare or Panic: URI Professor's Advice for Addressing a Global Pandemic and the Climate Crisis by Tim Faulkner, ecoRI News (Rhode Island), Apr 4, 2020\nUnder Cover of Pandemic, Fossil Fuel Interests Unleash Lobbying Frenzy by Dana Drugmand, DeSmog, Apr 2, 2020\nMon, Apr 6, 2020\nHow Coronavirus Could Help Us Fight Climate Change: Lessons From The Pandemic by David Vetter, Energy, Forbes, Mar 30, 2020\nAs Himalayas Warm, Nepal’s Climate Migrants Struggle to Survive by Bhadra Sharma & Kai Schultz, Asia Pacific, New York Times, Apr 5, 2020\nCentral banks must target a green recovery after coronavirus, Opinion by Nick Bryer, Thomson Reuters Foundation, Apr 4, 2020\nEssential' but Unprotected, Farmworkers Live in Fear of Covid-19 but Keep Working by Evelyn Nieves, InsideClimate News, Apr 3, 2020\nThe collapse of the US fracking industry, in seven charts by Tim McDonnell, Quartz, Apr 3, 2020\nGreat Barrier Reef suffers its most widespread mass bleaching event on record by Maddie Stone, Capital Weather Gang, Washington Post, Apr 6, 2020\nAlberta’s $5.3 Billion Backing of Keystone XL Signals Vulnerability of Canadian Oil by Nicholas Kusnetz, Inside Climate News, Apr 6, 2020\n'Creating Our Legacies': The Elders Fighting for Climate Justice by Alex Schwartz, Earther, Gizmodo, Apr 6, 2020\nTue, Apr 7, 2020\nGutting fuel economy standards during a pandemic is peak Trump by David Roberts, Energy & Environment, Vox, Apr 2, 2020\nSorry to disappoint climate deniers, but coronavirus makes the low-carbon transition more urgent by John Hewson, The Conversation AU, Apr 6, 2020\n5 Ways the Economic Upheaval of Coronavirus May Impact CO2 Emissions by Benjamin Storrow, E&E News/Scientific American, Apr 6, 2020\nWhat the Coronavirus Pandemic Can Teach Us About the Climate Emergency by Charles Komanoff & Christopher Ketcham, The Intercept, Apr 4, 2020\nIn a Race Against Global Warming, Robins Are Migrating Earlier by Bob Berwyn, InsideClimate News, Apr 7, 2020\nWhat We Pretend to Know About the Coronavirus Could Kill Us, Opinion by Charlie Warzel, Sunday Review, New York Times, Apr 3, 2020\nThe Green New Deal Is Cheap, Actually by Tim Dickinson, Politics, Rolling Stone Magazine, Apr 6, 2020\nWed, Apr 8, 2020\nAirlines urge UN body to ease climate goals for 2020s as traffic collapses by Chloé Farand, Climate Home News, Apr 6, 2020\nFive trees or a latte?

   "title": "Deep emissions cuts this decade could prevent ‘abrupt ecological collapse’",
   "paragraph": "Deep emissions cuts this decade could prevent ‘abrupt ecological collapse’\nPosted on 10 April 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Daisy Dunne\nSwift global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could prevent the “abrupt” collapse of ecosystems, which may otherwise begin within the next few decades, a study finds.\nThe research, published in Nature, finds that uncontrolled climate change would see tropical ocean ecosystems exposed to potentially catastrophic temperature rise by 2030. By 2050, tropical forests could also face such conditions.\nBy comparison, limiting global warming to below 2C – the goal of the Paris Agreement – could delay the date of exposure by up to six decades, according to the research.\nThe results “show very clearly that it is not too late to act and the benefits of acting now will be massive”, a study author tells Carbon Brief.\nBurning up\nRising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are expected to make existing habitats inhospitable for many animal species. Due to this, some scientists expect that climate change will overtake land-use change to become the largest threat facing wildlife by the end of the century.\nHowever, it is not yet certain at what point this century the effects of climate change will begin to overwhelm ecosystems. The new study addresses this question by looking at when various land and ocean ecosystems are likely to be exposed to possibly intolerable increases in temperature.\nThe results suggest the fate of ecosystems could hinge on the world taking immediate action to tackle climate change, says study author Dr Alex Pigot, a research scientist at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research at University College London. He tells Carbon Brief:\n“Our results show that with continued high emissions of greenhouse gasses, losses of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystems from climate change are likely to happen abruptly and could occur much sooner than we had expected.\n“According to our models, biodiversity losses are likely to be already underway in the tropical oceans and over the next few decades these risks are expected to escalate rapidly, spreading to tropical forests and then higher latitudes by 2050.”\nCorals to forests\nFor their research, the authors estimated the first date at which species in different world regions are likely to face temperatures beyond what they are known to tolerate in the wild.\nExposure to such temperatures could cause species to die out in that region – or to go “locally extinct”. However, it is possible that some species could adapt to intolerable temperatures, Pigot says:\n“It is important to note exposure does not necessarily mean extinction. Some species may be able to persist at temperatures warmer than those under which they have previously been found, but this is not something we should blindly assume. Indeed, for some species we already have very good evidence that their current [temperature range] is likely to correspond closely to their physiological limits.”\nThey did this for more than 30,000 species spanning the world’s habitats, from tropical coral reefs to highland pine forests.\nWestern lowland gorillas and forest elephants in a clearing in tropical rainforest, Obandas Bai, Repubic of Congo. Credit: Nature Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo\nIt should also be noted, however, that the authors only studied changes to temperature and rainfall exposure. They did not model other climate-change impacts known to affect wildlife, such as heatwaves or the disappearance of Arctic sea ice.\nThe authors looked at the timing of exposure under several scenarios for future climate change, known as the “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs). These scenarios include one where future greenhouse gas emissions are very high (RCP8.5) and one where temperatures are limited to below 2C (RCP2.6). (It is important to note that RCP8.5 is not a “business as usual” scenario, but rather a scenario where no policies are put in place to tackle climate change.)\nThe two maps below illustrate how the risk to wildlife differs in these two scenarios. The maps show the risk of an ecosystem seeing an “abrupt exposure event” under RCP2.6 (top) and RCP8.5 (bottom). An “abrupt exposure event” is defined as when more than 20% of all species in an ecosystem are exposed to temperatures beyond their natural range in a single decade.\nRisk of abrupt exposure of ecosystems to intolerable temperatures under RCP2.6 (top) and RCP8.5 (bottom). Risk is defined as the proportion of the 22 climate models used in the study that expect a given region to experience an abrupt exposure event by the end of the century. For example, a risk of 1.0 (dark purple) indicates that all the models expect that region to see an abrupt exposure event by the end of the century, while 0.0 (grey) indicates that none of the models expect there to be an exposure event. Source: Trisos et al. (2020)\nThe maps show how, under high emissions, many biodiversity hotspots, including the Amazon, parts of southern Africa and southeast Asia, could face a very high risk of exposure to intolerable temperatures by the end of the century.\nThe research finds that, under 2C of global warming, only 2% of ecosystems worldwide are likely to face an abrupt exposure event by the end of the century. Under 4C, this proportion rises to 15%.\nThe authors also find that limiting global warming to below 2C could delay the time when ecosystems first experience abrupt exposure events by up to six decades, when compared to the RCP8.5 scenario of very high emissions\nThis is indicated on the charts below, which show the projected percentage of the world’s ocean (left) and land (ecosystems) exposed to intolerable temperatures under RCP2.6 (light blue) and RCP8.5 (purple) from 2020-2100. (The chart also shows results for RCP4.5 (orange), a scenario where future emissions are moderately high.)\nThe projected percentage of ocean (left) and land (ecosystems) exposed to intolerable temperatures under RCP2.6 (light blue), RCP4.5 (orange) and RCP8.5 (purple) from 2020-2100. Source: Trisos et al. (2020)\n‘Not too late’\nThe research finds that, under a very high emissions scenario, ecosystems could be exposed to intolerably high temperatures as early as this decade. However, this does not mean it is too late to act, Pigot tells Carbon Brief:\n“Our results show very clearly that it is not too late to act and the benefits of acting now will be massive and will accumulate over time. By holding warming below 2C, we can effectively ‘flatten the curve’ of how climate risks to biodiversity accumulates over time, delaying the exposure of the most at-risk species by many decades and averting exposure entirely for many thousands of species.”\nThe findings are “very strong and convincing” says Peter Soroye, a PhD candidate in biology from the University of Ottawa, Canada, who recently published a study on projected bumblebee declines worldwide. He tells Carbon Brief:\n“One of the critical things that this and other large-scale studies on climate change-related biodiversity impacts show is the positive effect of reducing carbon emissions on future biodiversity. Work like this demonstrates that while future climate change will modify ecosystems around the globe – overwhelmingly for the worse – we can mitigate many of these impacts by rapidly reducing our carbon emissions.”\nTrisos, C.

   "title": "The irreversible emissions of a permafrost ‘tipping point’",
   "paragraph": "The irreversible emissions of a permafrost ‘tipping point’\nPosted on 7 April 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Dr Christina Schädel\nAcross vast swaths of the northern hemisphere’s higher reaches, frozen ground holds billions of tonnes of carbon.\nAs global temperatures rise, this “permafrost” land is at increasing risk of thawing out, potentially releasing its long-held carbon into the atmosphere.\nAbrupt permafrost thaw is one of the most frequently discussed “tipping points” that could be crossed in a warming world. However, research suggests that, while this thawing is already underway, it can be slowed with climate change mitigation.\nTipping points\nThis article is part of a week-long special series on “tipping points”, where a changing climate could push parts of the Earth system into abrupt or irreversible change\nExplainer: Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change\nGuest post: Could the Atlantic Overturning Circulation ‘shut down’?\nGuest post: The irreversible emissions of a permafrost ‘tipping point’\nGuest post: Could climate change and deforestation spark Amazon ‘dieback’?\nGuest post: How close is the West Antarctic ice sheet to a ‘tipping point’?\nYet, what is irreversible is the escape of the carbon that has been – and is being – emitted. The carbon released from permafrost goes into the atmosphere and stays there, exacerbating global warming.\nIn short, what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic.\nPermafrost and the global climate\nPermafrost is ground that has been frozen for at least two consecutive years. Its thickness ranges from less than one metre to more than a kilometre. Typically, it sits beneath an “active layer” that thaws and refreezes every year.\nA warming climate puts this perennially frozen ground at risk. When temperatures rise, permafrost thaws – it does not melt.\nThere is a simple analogy: compare what happens to an ice cube and a frozen chicken when they are taken out of the freezer. At room temperature, the former will have melted, leaving a small pool of water, but the chicken will have thawed, leaving a raw chicken. Eventually, that chicken will start to decompose.\nThis is exactly what happens to permafrost when temperatures increase. One quarter of the landmass of the northern hemisphere is underlain by permafrost, which acts like Earth’s gigantic freezer and keeps enormous amounts of organic matter frozen.\nGlobal permafrost map, International Permafrost Association.

Credit: C. Schädel\nArctic temperatures have been increasing more than twice as fast as the global average. This has caused permafrost thaw in many locations and triggered newly awakened microbes to decompose the organic material thereby releasing CO2 or methane into the atmosphere.\nBoth gases are greenhouse gases, but methane is 28-36 times more potent than CO2 over a century. However, there is more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and methane is oxidised to CO2 on timescales of about a decade. So, it is the change in atmospheric CO2 concentration that really matters for long-term climate change.\nCarbon release from permafrost\nSo, what role will permafrost play in future carbon emissions? And is there a tipping point that could trigger rapid thaw?\nScientists estimate that there is about twice as much carbon stored in permafrost as circulating in the atmosphere. This is approximately 1460bn-1600bn tonnes of carbon.\nMost of it is currently frozen and preserved, but if even a small fraction is released into the atmosphere, the emissions would likely be large – potentially similar in magnitude to carbon release from other environmental fluxes, such as deforestation.\nThis would still be about one order of magnitude smaller than emissions from fossil-fuel burning by the end of this century. Nevertheless, every additional molecule of CO2 or methane added to the atmosphere accelerates climate change and affects the whole planet and its climate.\nCollapsing permafrost with large ice volume. Credit: A. Balser\nTo our current knowledge, carbon release from permafrost is a gradual and sustained process that continually adds carbon to the atmosphere – thus, further reinforcing warming.\nOnce the organic matter within permafrost decomposes and releases CO2 and methane, there is no getting it back. In this sense, permafrost thaw is irreversible – meeting one of the conditions of the definition of a tipping point.\nHowever, recent research suggests that if temperature rise were to slow and stop, permafrost thaw, too, would slow – and potentially stop, thus, limiting further emissions. Nonetheless, this would take some time. Permafrost thaw is a bit like a heavy freight train – once it is moving, it can’t be stopped immediately. And even after putting on the brakes, it will continue to roll onwards for a while. Research suggests that emissions could continue for decades to centuries even once permafrost thaw has slowed down.\nThis suggests that permafrost as a whole will not have shifted to a completely new state – as is the case with some tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. As a result, it would be possible to prevent further emissions were global warming to be halted.\nBut, as things stand, permafrost thaw has already been observed in many locations in the Arctic. And as the recent special report on the ocean and cryosphere by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points out, warming this century will cause substantial emissions from permafrost:\n“By 2100, near-surface permafrost area will decrease by 2-66% for RCP2.6 and 30–99% for RCP8.5. This could release 10s to 100s of gigatonnes of carbon as CO2 and methane to the atmosphere for RCP8.5, with the potential to accelerate climate change.”\nHow to add certainty to permafrost carbon release\nThe ultimate contribution of permafrost carbon to climate change depends on a variety of factors: how much of the carbon will come out as CO2 or methane, for example, and how much can plants and trees offset some of the additional carbon release.\nPermafrost degradation can occur as gradual top down thaw or as abrupt collapse of thawing soil. Both processes release carbon to the atmosphere. Gradual top-down thaw is the result of warmer air temperatures causing the soil to thaw from the top down, whereas abrupt thaw occurs suddenly and unpredictably.\nPermafrost can contain up to 80% ice. If the ice melts – remember the ice does melt even though the soil does not – the ground suddenly collapses and deep layers get exposed to air temperature.\nCollapsing ground can leave the landscape pockmarked by “thermokarst” lakes, filled with meltwater, rain and snow. These wet conditions can promote the release of the more potent greenhouse gas methane.\nThermokarst landscape. Credit: A. Balser\nIn uplands, natural drainage creates drier soil conditions after permafrost thaw, thereby accelerating organic matter decomposition and releasing large amounts of CO2. The ultimate impact of carbon release from permafrost will be stronger when a larger percentage of the permafrost zone dries out after thaw.\nWhat fraction of the landscape will become wetter or drier after thaw depends on the distribution of ground ice, but current ice measurements are only sporadic and better spatial coverage and more up to date measurements are urgently needed.\nAnother important factor in the carbon balance of the permafrost zone is the carbon uptake by plants. The question is how much carbon release from thawing permafrost can be offset by increased plant growth? Plants take up carbon from the atmosphere and use it to grow and maintain their metabolism.\nWarmer conditions in the Arctic and all its associated changes stimulate plant growth, which means that some of the carbon added to the atmosphere from thawing permafrost is taken up by the boost to plant growth. But it is unclear how much carbon will be offset by plants and it is unclear how sustained this process is.\nImproving model projections of permafrost carbon release is crucial in determining the overall impact of thawing permafrost to the global climate. Recent results from the Canadian Arctic show that permafrost thaw is happening a lot earlier than scientists expected given current model projections.\nFor the moment, models only account for gradual top-down thaw, but recent estimates show that abrupt thaw and collapsing soil could double carbon release from permafrost. One thing is clear: the less temperatures increase in the Arctic, the more permafrost will stay frozen and the more carbon will stay locked up in permafrost.\nMethane hydrates\nOften mentioned in the same breath as permafrost thaw is the potential danger associated with the breakdown of methane hydrates, also known as “clathrates”. This is methane “ice” that forms at low temperatures and high pressures in continental margin marine sediments or within and beneath permafrost.\nOf particular concern are the methane hydrates stored beneath the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), a shallow coastal region to the north of Russia. Studies have suggested that thawing permafrost is releasing this methane, letting it bubble up and out of the seawater. This has led to research warning that the escape of large quantities of methane could have “catastrophic consequences for the climate system” and media reports of an impending “methane timebomb”.\nIn conversation with Dr Carolyn Ruppel, chief scientist for the US Geological Survey’s Gas Hydrates Project, she tells me that methane hydrates trap about one-sixth of Earth’s methane carbon and that some deposits may, in fact, be degrading now as the climate warms. But, she says:\n“If the methane released during gas hydrate degradation reaches the ocean, it would mostly be consumed by bacteria in the water column and not reach the atmosphere. In permafrost areas, degrading gas hydrate is usually deeply buried, so permafrost thaw is the more important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.”\nWhile there “may be substantial methane leaking from Arctic continental shelves in areas of thawing subsea permafrost”, says Ruppel, “studies have shown that the flux rates are probably overestimated and the most likely source of the leaking methane is not thawing gas hydrates”. She adds:\n“Permafrost-associated hydrates are not that widespread and often occur deeper than the shallower sources of methane that can more readily leak into the atmosphere.”\nSo, the latest research suggests that a methane bomb from thawing hydrates is not on the horizon. However, for permafrost, the science shows that thaw is already underway and the carbon it is releasing will already be contributing to our warming climate."

   "paragraph": "Could the Atlantic Overturning Circulation ‘shut down’?\nPosted on 6 April 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Dr. Richard Wood and Dr. Laura Jackson\nGenerally, we think of climate change as a gradual process: the more greenhouse gases that humans emit, the more the climate will change. But are there any “points of no return” that commit us to irreversible change?\nThe “Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation”, known as “AMOC”, is one of the major current systems in the world’s oceans and plays a crucial role in regulating climate.\nTipping points\nThis article is part of a week-long special series on “tipping points”, where a changing climate could push parts of the Earth system into abrupt or irreversible change\nExplainer: Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change\nGuest post: Could the Atlantic Overturning Circulation ‘shut down’?\nGuest post: The irreversible emissions of a permafrost ‘tipping point’\nGuest post: Could climate change and deforestation spark Amazon ‘dieback’?\nGuest post: How close is the West Antarctic ice sheet to a ‘tipping point’?\nIt is driven by a delicate balance of ocean temperatures and salinity, which is at risk from being upset by a warming climate.\nThe latest research suggests that AMOC is very likely to weaken this century, but a collapse is very unlikely. However, scientists are some way from being able to define exactly how much warming might push AMOC past a tipping point.\nOverturning\nThe figure below shows an illustration of the AMOC. In the North Atlantic, warm water from the subtropics travels northwards near the surface and cold – and, hence, more dense – water is travelling southwards at depth, typically 2–4km below the surface.\nIn the north, the warm surface water is cooled by the overlying atmosphere, converted to cold, dense water, and sinks to supply the deep, southward branch. Elsewhere, the cold water upwells and is warmed, re-supplying the upper, warm branch and completing the circuit.\nSchematic of the AMOC. The red pathways show warmer water nearer the surface, while the purple pathways show colder, more dense water moving at depth. Credit: Met Office\nCould the AMOC collapse?\nThe AMOC is vulnerable to climate change. As the atmosphere warms due to increasing greenhouse gases, the ability of the ocean to lose heat from the North Atlantic surface is diminished and one of the driving factors of the AMOC is weakened.\nClimate-model projections of global warming this century consistently point to a weakening of the AMOC. The most recent assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – the fifth assessment report (AR5) and special report on oceans and cryosphere in a changing climate (SROCC) – both conclude that the AMOC is “very likely” to weaken over the 21st century.\nSuch a weakening would have a cooling effect on climate around the North Atlantic region, as the northward heat supply is slowed down. This effect is included in the climate projections, but the direct warming effect from rising concentrations of greenhouse gases is stronger, so the net result is still warming over land regions.\nBut more dramatic changes are theoretically possible. A “tipping point” may exist beyond which the current strong AMOC becomes unsustainable.\nEvidence for this goes back to a seminal paper published in 1961 by one of the fathers of modern oceanography, Henry Stommel. Stommel realised that the AMOC is a kind of competition between the effects of temperature and salinity, both of which influence the density of seawater.\nThe figure below illustrates the different possible AMOC states. In today’s climate, temperature dominates and the cold, dense high latitude water drives a strong AMOC (red curve). But in other climate states it is possible for fresh water (from rainfall or ice melt) to freshen – and so lighten – the high-latitude water; in this case, the water is not dense enough to drive the AMOC, which collapses (blue curve).\nIf the freshwater input to the Atlantic were strong enough – from rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet, for example – the blue dot would move to the right in the figure. According to Stommel’s model, at some point the strong AMOC state (red) becomes unsustainable and the AMOC collapses to the “off” state (blue). Then, even if the driving climate change were later reversed (the blue dot moving back to the left on the figure), the AMOC would stay on the blue curve and would not switch back on again until the climate had overshot the present day conditions in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is known as “hysteresis”.\nTipping points and hysteresis of the AMOC in Stommel’s simple model. Possible states of the AMOC depend on the amount of freshwater input to the Atlantic Ocean (x-axis). AMOC strength is shown on the y-axis. [Note that both are measured in Sverdrups (Sv), where 1 Sv denotes one million cubic metres of water transported per second.] When there is low freshwater input, temperature dominates the flow and only a strong AMOC is possible (red curve). For high freshwater input, only a collapsed state is possible (blue curve). In between, both states are possible. If the freshwater input were to increase beyond a critical value (the tipping point), the AMOC would collapse. Then, even if the freshwater input were returned to its original state, the AMOC would remain off. Credit: Met Office.\nLong-term projections\nStommel’s idea has evolved over the years, but the fundamental insight is still relevant. There is evidence that AMOC changes may have played a role in some major climate shifts of the past – most recently around 8,200 years ago as the world was emerging from the last ice age.\nAt that time, a huge lake in northwest Canada was being held back by an ice wall. As temperatures warmed the ice wall collapsed, depositing the fresh water from the lake into the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC. A major cooling at this time can be seen in palaeoclimatic records across North America, Greenland and Europe.\nComprehensive climate models generally do not project a complete shutdown of the AMOC in the 21st century, but recently models have been run further into the future. Under scenarios of continued high greenhouse gas concentrations, a number of models project an effective AMOC shutdown by 2300.\nModel projections of the future AMOC do range widely, though. As a result, on the question of what level of global warming would result in an AMOC shutdown, it is unlikely that the scientific community will see any convergence in the near future.\nWhile the fundamental mechanism that destabilises the AMOC in Stommel’s original model appears to be important in climate models, there are other processes that are trying to stabilise the AMOC. Many of these processes are difficult to model quantitatively, especially with the limited resolution that is possible with current computing power. So our AMOC projections will continue to be subject to quite some uncertainty for some time to come.\nTaking all the evidence into account, the IPCC’s AR5 and SROCC concluded that an AMOC collapse before 2100 was “very unlikely” (pdf). However, the impacts of passing an AMOC tipping point would be huge, so it is best viewed as a “low probability, high impact” scenario.\nWhat would be the impacts of a collapse?\nClimate models can be used to assess the impact on climate if the AMOC were to shut down completely. By adding large amounts of fresh water to the North Atlantic in a model, scientists artificially lighten the cold, dense water that forms the lower branch of the loop. This stops the AMOC and we can then look at the impact on climate.\nThe figure below illustrates the changes that result in one such experiment. Shutdown of the AMOC results in a cooling (blue shading) of the whole northern hemisphere, particularly the regions closest to the zone of North Atlantic heat loss (the “radiator” of the North Atlantic central heating system). In these regions the cooling exceeds the projected warming due to greenhouse gases, so a complete shutdown in the 21st century, while very unlikely, could result in a net cooling in regions such as western Europe.\nModelled change in surface temperature (C) following an artificially induced collapse of the AMOC. Shading indicates cooling (blue) or warming (orange and red). Reprinted by permission from Springer. Jackson et al. (2015) Global and European climate impacts of a slowdown of the AMOC in a high resolution GCM, Climate Dynamics.\nOther impacts include major shifts in rainfall patterns, increases in winter storms over Europe and a sea level rise of up to 50cm around the North Atlantic basin. In many regions these effects would exacerbate the trends due to global warming.\nWhile such model experiments are artificial “what if?” scenarios, they illustrate the magnitude of the changes that could result from an AMOC collapse. The impacts on agriculture, wildlife, transport, energy demand and coastal infrastructure would be complex, but we can be certain that there would be major socioeconomic consequences. For example, one study showed a 50% reduction in grass productivity in major grazing regions of the western UK and Ireland.\nWhat can be done about the risk of a collapse?\nAs explained above, scientists are some way from being able to confidently define a level of global warming at which the AMOC would be at risk of crossing a tipping point.\nHowever, it may be possible to manage the risk of AMOC collapse, even without knowing how likely it is.\nTo take a domestic analogy: I know that it is possible, but unlikely, that my house will burn down – it is a low-probability, high-impact event. I don’t have much idea of how probable it is that I will have a fire, but I can manage the risk anyway by getting the electrical wiring checked and by installing smoke alarms. The wiring check reduces the chance of a fire, while the smoke alarm gives me early warning if a fire starts so that the impact can be reduced – by evacuating the house and calling the fire brigade.\nRecently, along with colleagues at the University of Exeter, we have been exploring the possibility of developing an early-warning system for AMOC tipping.\nUsing a simple model, we have shown that the way the salinities of the subtropical and subpolar Atlantic evolve over time can give an early indication if the AMOC is on the path to a collapse, possibly decades before any major weakening has been seen in the AMOC itself.\nIt is early days for this research, but by monitoring such an indicator it may be possible to give more time to prepare for the consequences of an AMOC collapse, or to adopt more aggressive climate change mitigation measures to get the AMOC onto a more stable pathway.\nOutstanding questions\nAs the world gets to grips with the challenges of meeting the targets of the Paris climate accord, interest is increasing in climate pathways that temporarily overshoot the final target level. It is important that such overshoots do not cross any irreversible thresholds on the way to the final destination, so research on tipping points needs to link theoretical results to these more practical questions.\nMuch of the modelling of AMOC tipping points to date has used idealised scenarios of freshwater input to the North Atlantic. This is relevant to some past AMOC changes, but to model future climate change we need to understand what happens when warming and freshening are taking place together.\nThis is a more challenging problem because the number of relevant processes and feedbacks is increased. Some of these processes operate at small scales that models struggle to resolve with current computing power. Improving the modelling of key AMOC processes needs patience and long-term commitment, but will eventually pay dividends in more confident AMOC predictions.\nResearch on early warning of AMOC collapse is in its infancy, but may be a fruitful way to respond to the risk. One thing is for sure: early warning will require continuous observations of key aspects of the AMOC.\nAMOC monitoring entered a new era in 2004 with RAPID-MOCHA, an array of moored instruments that spans the width of the Atlantic at latitude 26.5 degrees north and provides continuous monitoring of the AMOC. Before this there had only been five snapshots of the circulation spread over 47 years.\nResults have already changed our understanding of how the AMOC varies in time: for example, an unexpected dip in the AMOC – observed in Autumn 2009 – is thought to have played a role in the unusually cold European winters of 2009-10 and 2010-11.\nMore recently, a similar monitoring array has been installed further north in the subpolar Atlantic. Along with continuous measurements of temperature and salinity from drifting Argo floats, oceanographers now have an unprecedented database to study this crucial element of our climate system and give the world a chance to prepare for any nasty surprises."

Photograph: Suomi/VIIRS and Modis/Nasa\nThe North Atlantic may be a weaker climate ally than previously believed, according to a study that suggests the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide has been overestimated.\nA first-ever winter and spring sampling of plankton in the western North Atlantic showed cell sizes were considerably smaller than scientists assumed, which means the carbon they absorb does not sink as deep or as fast, nor does it stay in the depths for as long.\nThis discovery is likely to force a negative revision of global climate calculations, say the authors of the Nasa-backed study, though it is unclear by how much.\n“We have found a misconception. It will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,” said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni. “It will require more than just a small tweak.”\nOceans' capacity to absorb CO2 overestimated, study suggests by Jonathan Watts, Environment, Guardian, Apr 3, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article.\nEditorial of the Week...\nBig Oil is using the coronavirus pandemic to push through the Keystone XL pipeline\nThe oil industry saw its opening and moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of this moment\nTransCanada’s Keystone pipeline facility.

   "title": "A history of FLICC: the 5 techniques of science denial",
   "paragraph": "A history of FLICC: the 5 techniques of science denial\nPosted on 31 March 2020 by John Cook\nIn 2007, Mark Hoofnagle suggested on his Science Blog Denialism that denialists across a range of topics such as climate change, evolution, & HIV/AIDS all employed the same rhetorical tactics to sow confusion. The five general tactics were conspiracy, selectivity (cherry-picking), fake experts, impossible expectations (also known as moving goalposts), and general fallacies of logic.\nTwo years later, Pascal Diethelm and Martin McKee published an article in the scientific journal European Journal of Public Health titled Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond? They further fleshed out Hoofnagle’s five denialist tactics and argued that we should expose to public scrutiny the tactics of denial, identifying them for what they are. I took this advice to heart and began including the five denialist tactics in my own talks about climate misinformation.\nIn 2013, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition invited me to give a workshop about climate misinformation at their annual summit. As I prepared my presentation, I mused on whether the five denial techniques could be adapted into a sticky, easy-to-remember acronym. I vividly remember my first attempt: beginning with Fake Experts, Unrealistic Expectations, Cherry Picking… realizing I was going in a problematic direction for a workshop for young participants. I started over and settled on FLICC: Fake experts, Logical fallacies, Impossible expectations, Cherry picking, and Conspiracy theories.\nWhen I led a 2015 collaboration between the University of Queensland and Skeptical Science to develop the free online course Denial101x: Making Sense of Climate Science Denial, we made FLICC the underlying framework of the entire course. An important component of our debunking of the most common myths about climate change was identifying the denial techniques in each myth. A common comment we received from students was how much they appreciated learning about FLICC.\nSince moving to the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, I’ve continued to build the FLICC taxonomy. In my collaboration with critical thinking philosophers Peter Ellerton and David Kinkead, I was introduced to reasoning fallacies that we hadn’t included in Denial101x. As I begun developing the Cranky Uncle game, I began a series of fallacy quizzes where I gradually built the taxonomy up as I introduced people to an ever-growing collection of denial techniques (note the differing difficulty levels between quiz #1 and quiz #8). When Stephan Lewandowsky and I published The Conspiracy Theory Handbook, we added seven traits of conspiratorial thinking. Here is the latest version of the FLICC taxonomy (with all the icons freely available and shareable on Wikimedia):\nWhen I visited Brisbane in December 2019, I asked the University of Queensland if I could record a video explaining the updated FLICC taxonomy. They agreed but once they saw my script, including explanations and definitions of each denial technique, they suggested I divide the video into a three-parter. Always a sucker for a trilogy, I agreed – here are the three videos:\nAs well as the videos, this post includes written definitions and examples of each denial technique. I will continue to update this table as the taxonomy evolves in the future.\nTECHNIQUE DEFINITION EXAMPLE\nAd Hominem Attacking a person/group instead of addressing their arguments. “Climate science can’t be trusted because climate scientists are biased.”\nAmbiguity Using ambiguous language in order to lead to a misleading conclusion. “Thermometer readings have uncertainty which means we don’t know whether global warming is happening.”\nAnecdote Using personal experience or isolated examples instead of sound arguments or compelling evidence. “The weather is cold today—whatever happened to global warming?”\nBlowfish Focusing on an inconsequential aspect of scientific research, blowing it out of proportion in order to distract from or cast doubt on the main conclusions of the research. “The hockey stick graph is invalid because it contains statistical errors.”\nBulk Fake Experts Citing large numbers of seeming experts to argue that there is no scientific consensus on a topic. “There is no expert consensus because 31,487 Americans with a science degree signed a petition saying humans aren’t disrupting climate.”\nCherry Picking Carefully selecting data that appear to confirm one position while ignoring other data that contradicts that position. “Global warming stopped in 1998.”\nContradictory Simultaneously believing in ideas that are mutually contradictory. “The temperature record is fabricated by scientists… the temperature record shows cooling.”\nConspiracy Theory Proposing that a secret plan exists to implement a nefarious scheme such as hiding a truth. “The climategate emails prove that climate scientists have engaged in a conspiracy to deceive the public.”\nFake Debate Presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format to give the false impression of an ongoing scientific debate. “Climate deniers should get equal coverage with climate scientists, providing a more balanced presentation of views.”\nFake Experts Presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information. “A retired physicist argues against the climate consensus, claiming the current weather change is just a natural occurrence.”\nFalse Analogy Assuming that because two things are alike in some ways, they are alike in some other respect. “Climate skeptics are like Galileo who overturned the scientific consensus about geocentrism.”\nFalse Choice Presenting two options as the only possibilities, when other possibilities exist. “CO2 lags temperature in the ice core record, proving that temperature drives CO2, not the other way around.”\nImmune to evidence Re-interpreting any evidence that counters a conspiracy theory as originating from the conspiracy. “Those investigations finding climate scientists aren’t conspiring were part of the conspiracy.”\nImpossible Expectations Demanding unrealistic standards of certainty before acting on the science. “Scientists can’t even predict the weather next week. How can they predict the climate in 100 years?”\nLogical Fallacies Arguments where the conclusion doesn’t logically follow from the premises. Also known as a non sequitur. “Climate has changed naturally in the past so what’s happening now must be natural.”\nMagnified Minority Magnifying the significance of a handful of dissenting scientists to cast doubt on an overwhelming scientific consensus. “Sure, there’s 97% consensus but Professor Smith disagrees with the consensus position.”\nMisrepresentation Misrepresenting a situation or an opponent’s position in such a way as to distort understanding. “They changed the name from ‘global warming’ to ‘climate change’ because global warming stopped happening.”\nMoving Goalposts Demanding higher levels of evidence after receiving requested evidence. “Sea levels may be rising but they’re not accelerating.”\nNefarious intent Assuming that the motivations behind any presumed conspiracy are nefarious. “Climate scientists promote the climate hoax because they’re in it for the money.”\nOverriding suspicion Having a nihilistic degree of skepticism towards the official account, preventing belief in anything that doesn’t fit into the conspiracy theory. “Show me one line of evidence for climate change… oh, that evidence is faked!”\nOversimplification Simplifying a situation in such a way as to distort understanding, leading to erroneous conclusions. “CO2 is plant food so burning fossil fuels will be good for plants.”\nPersecuted victim Perceiving and presenting themselves as the victim of organized persecution. “Climate scientists are trying to take away our freedom.”\nQuote Mining Taking a person’s words out-of-context in order to misrepresent their position. “Mike’s trick… to hide the decline.”\nRe-interpreting randomness Believing that nothing occurs by accident, so that random events are re-interpreted as being caused by the conspiracy. “NASA’s satellite exploded? They must be trying to hide inconvenient data!”\nRed Herring Deliberately diverting attention to an irrelevant point to distract from a more important point. “CO2 is a trace gas so it’s warming effect is minimal.”\nSingle Cause Assuming a single cause or reason when there might be multiple causes or reasons. “Climate has changed naturally in the past so what’s happening now must be natural.”\nSlippery Slope Suggesting that taking a minor action will inevitably lead to major consequences. “If we implement even a modest climate policy, it will start us down the slippery slope to socialism and taking away our freedom.”\nSlothful Induction Ignoring relevant evidence when coming to a conclusion. “There is no empirical evidence that humans are causing global warming.”\nSomething must be wrong Maintaining that “something must be wrong” and the official account is based on deception, even when specific parts of a conspiracy theory become untenable. “Ok, fine, 97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming, but that’s just because they’re toeing the party line.”\nStraw Man Misrepresenting or exaggerating an opponent’s position to make it easier to attack. “In the 1970s, climate scientists were predicting an ice age.”\nAnd lastly, a bit of fun. Every year, Inside the Greenhouse hold a competition inviting people to submit climate comedy videos. In 2019, I submitted Giving Climate Denial the FLICC, which received an honorable mention.\nThis post is reposted from crankyuncle.com."

   "paragraph": "Scientists share their grief, anger, and hope over climate change\nPosted on 30 March 2020 by greenman3610\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nThis month’s original YCC “This Is Not Cool” video shows how several experienced climate scientists are handling the emotional and personal feelings that many feel in grasping the potential adverse effects of runaway climate change. In the current global context posed by the coronavirus pandemic, there are striking similarities between the COVID-19 disease and risks posed by climate change.\n“Knowing what I know about the science and the projections, that puts me into a state of grief,” says climate scientist Jeff Kiehl, a veteran of the National Center for Atmospheric Research now associated with the University of California, Santa Cruz. With a first grandchild now 10 months old, Kiehl points to what he sees as “lost opportunities” to get a jump on climate change and says he fears “loss of a world that we as a species have known since our beginning.”\n“I’ve been there, I’ve been depressed about these results many times,” says University of Wisconsin scientist Andrea Dutton. She says that in her presentations to the public, she feels it is important to help audiences fully discuss personal feelings with friends, family, and acquaintances.\n“We almost need a team of psychiatrists and therapists to go into a community dealing with climate change to allow people to process all these emotions,” Dutton says. She adds that “we must allow people to emotionally respond to scientists’ information” and “accept reality.” Her prescription: “For me, it’s engaging in solutions. … The future is going to be different” and the public should “not fight that feeling anymore” but rather accept and ask how that future should best be shaped.\nAnger is OK and can lead to constructive engagement\nAsked by videographer Peter Sinclair if scientists should feel a “sense of anger,” Kiehl says well-channeled anger over climate change risks can be “a good source of energy” and can lead to “some very constructive action” and engagement on climate change issues.\nDespite their anxieties, Kiehl and Dutton share the perspectives of two other scientists in the video – Twila Moon of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and Ben Abbott of Brigham Young University that, as Dutton says, “we can make a choice and choose a different pathway” forward. “The future is not written yet,” Dutton says. “We get to choose that future.”\n“We are nowhere near a point where we should put our heads in the sand or throw up our hands and feel that there is nothing we can do,” Moon says. “Indeed, what we do will be the primary determinant of what things look like in the future.”\nAbbott is similarly hopeful. “I really do see a sea change. Lots of people are recognizing that we are part of the problem,” he says. “That’s not reason to despair. That’s reason to take hope, because that means we can be the solution. Since it’s us, it’s absolutely within our control to change how we live, to protect the climate system and to ensure a better future.”"

Sign up to receive future installments.\nAn idea beloved of the technorati is that we are actually living not on the earth we seem to inhabit but in a simulation. Elon Musk has said that it’s “most likely” the case, and Neil deGrasse Tyson has set the odds at fifty-fifty. If so, we’ve clearly reached the point where whoever is supervising the action has handed the game over to a bored supervillain who is wildly pressing buttons: Pandemics! Locusts! Firestorms!\nThe name of this newsletter is The Climate Crisis, but for the moment the emphasis is going to be on the last of those words. We need to understand how crises work, and, since I’ve been thinking about them for many years, I have a few thoughts to offer. This week’s reflection has to do with time, which is a variable we seriously underappreciate. We’re used to political debates that go on forever—when I was a high-school debater, in 1978, our topic for the year was “That the federal government should establish a comprehensive program to regulate the health care system in the United States.” We imagine that, if we don’t solve a political problem now, we’ll get around to it eventually. Meanwhile, we’ll chip away at it—delaying a solution extends suffering along the way, but it doesn’t necessarily make a problem ultimately harder to solve. Certain kinds of problems don’t work that way, however. Physical problems—climate change and the coronavirus being the pertinent examples—are all about time. And what’s striking to me is how similar these two examples are.\nThe Nature of Crisis by Bill McKibben Annals of a Warming Planet, New Yorker Magazine, Mar 26, 2020\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\nSun, Mar 22, 2020\nIn Just 10 Years, Warming Has Increased the Odds of Disasters by Chelsea Harvey, E&E News/Scientific American, Mar 20, 2020\nClimate change could reverse falling inequality between countries, Guest Post by Aurélie Méjean, Nicolas Taconet & Céline Guivarch, Carbon Brief, Mar 17, 2020\nLong Phased-Out Refrigeration and Insulation Chemicals Still Widely in Use and Warming the Climate by Phil McKenna, InsideClimate News, Mar 17, 2020\n6 Ways Trump’s Denial of Science Has Delayed the Response to COVID-19 (and Climate Change) by Katelyn Weisbrod, InsideClimate News, Mar 19, 2010\nHolding back the tide - sea's advance threatens Tunisia's beaches by Layli Foroudi, Thomson Reuters Foundation, Mar 19, 2020\nStudy: global banks 'failing miserably' on climate crisis by funneling trillions into fossil fuels by Patrick Greenfield and Kalyeena Makortoff, Environment, Guardian, Mar 18, 2020\nLocust Swarms, Some 3 Times the Size of New York City, Are Eating Their Way Across Two Continents by Bob Berwyn, InsideClimate News, Mar 22, 2020\nThe key ingredient to surviving both coronavirus and climate change: our shared sense of humanity by Yvette Cabrera, Grist, Mar 22, 2020\nMon, Mar 23, 2020\nPoor water infrastructure is greater risk than coronavirus, says UN by Fiona Harvey, Environment, Guardian, Mar 21, 2020\nInternational Forest Day: Experts highlight the impact of climate change on Belgium's forests by Greg Lory, euronews, Mar 21, 2020\nWhat would happen if the world reacted to climate change like it’s reacting to the coronavirus? by Adele Peters, Fast Company, Mar 10, 2020\nCoronavirus and climate change: How eco-activists can use this terrible moment to help save the planet by Reynard Loki, Independent Media Institute/Nation of Change, Mar 21, 2020\nWater is an under-used weapon in climate change fight, UN says by Megan Rowling, Thomson Reuters Foundation, Mar 22, 2020\nThe good news about reforestation efforts by Martin Kuebler.

   "paragraph": "Aggressive action to address climate change could save the world $145 trillion\nPosted on 26 March 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nA respected research group, Project Drawdown, finds that deploying solutions consistent with meeting the Paris climate targets would cost tens of trillions of dollars globally. But crucially, those outlays would also yield long-term savings many times larger than the up-front costs.\nThe new 2020 Drawdown Review includes economic estimates of the capital costs to deploy each solution, net lifetime operation costs, and lifetime profits from the sale of products produced by the agricultural solutions. The key conclusion is that while the upfront costs are substantial – around $25 trillion globally – the resulting savings and profits are five to six times larger.\nProject Drawdown is a nonprofit organization that evaluates climate solutions nations could deploy to reach the point where greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere begin to decline (the threshold of carbon “drawdown”). Achieving drawdown will require phasing out the use of fossil fuels that add carbon and strengthening the natural sinks that absorb carbon. In 2017, the group published the New York Times bestselling book Drawdown, which described the 100 most substantive solutions to global warming based on a comprehensive scientific review by the project’s research team.\nThe new Drawdown Review considers two potential pathways. Scenario 1 envisions how climate solutions could be deployed to meet the Paris target of staying below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than pre-industrial temperatures, in which the point of carbon drawdown is reached in the mid-2060s. Scenario 2 is more ambitious, keeping global temperatures below the aspirational Paris target of 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by achieving carbon drawdown in the mid-2040s. In the more aggressive Scenario 2, global economic savings are $145 trillion, with an additional $29 trillion in profits generated from the agricultural sector – the latter on its own offsetting the initial $28 trillion capital costs. Both the Scenario 1 and 2 savings estimates are calculated over the life times of the solutions.\nBetter public health savings not factored in\nWithout even accounting for the many trillions of dollars saved by improving public health and avoiding climate damages, the researchers estimate that keeping global temperatures below the 1.5 degrees C target would result in a global net economic savings of $145 trillion.\nIn a few cases, the savings come almost immediately. For example, LEDs may cost more than the less efficient light bulbs they replace, but because they last so much longer, buying an LED is cheaper than repeatedly replacing equivalent shorter-lived bulbs. The Drawdown Review estimates that replacing older lighting technologies with LED bulbs would save $2 trillion dollars globally in capital costs, plus another $5 trillion in the long term as a result of improved energy efficiency.\nMost of the other climate solutions in the Drawdown Review have significant capital costs that are more than offset by lifetime use savings and/or profits. Solar panels and wind turbines, for example, have much lower operation and maintenance costs than the fossil fuel power plants they replace. As a result, the Drawdown Review estimates that over their lifetimes, the onshore wind turbines and utility-scale solar panels deployed in Scenario 2 would save $8.5 trillion and $28 trillion globally, respectively, along with another $13 trillion saved by distributed solar panels (e.g. installed on building roofs). Some of the other most cost-effective solutions include improving building insulation, which would save another $23 trillion by increasing energy efficiency, and electric cars, which would save $16 trillion by replacing less efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.\nMuch of the difference between the two Drawdown Review scenarios boils down to the speed at which wind and solar energy are deployed. In the more aggressive Scenario 2, onshore wind turbines and utility-scale photovoltaic panels are the two largest sources of reduced carbon emissions. This scenario envisions the share of global electricity from wind increasing sixfold, from 4.4% today to 27% by 2050, and solar farms exploding from just over 1% today to 25% in 2050. In Scenario 1, each would supply about 20% of global electricity by 2050.\nNo single ‘silver bullet’ solution to climate change\nSome of the other top climate solutions in the Drawdown Review may come as a surprise to some. They include reducing food waste, improving health and education, eating plant-rich diets, refrigerant management, and tropical forest restoration.\nAs a recent IPCC special report noted, 25-30% of the food produced worldwide is wasted. In developed countries, consumers throw out excess food, while in developing countries much of the waste results from a lack of refrigeration, causing products to spoil before reaching consumers. The IPCC report estimated that food waste costs the global economy about $1 trillion per year and accounts for about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions from food systems.\nAround one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from the food we eat. As Drawdown put it, “If cattle were their own nation, they would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.” Shifting toward plant-based diets can thus significantly reduce emissions while also improving public health.\nPopulation growth is another difficult factor to address, but a key contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions. Drawdown notes that “Women with more years of education have fewer and healthier children, and actively manage their reproductive health.”\nRefrigerators and air conditioners use chemical refrigerants that are often strong greenhouse gases. The chemical refrigerants that created the hole in the ozone layer were replaced by hydrofluorocarbons, which don’t deplete ozone, but are 1,000-9,000 times stronger greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. Substitutes including natural refrigerants like propane and ammonium are now available, and Drawdown concludes that their deployment would significantly curb global warming.\nTropical forests have been depleted in recent years, once covering 12% of the world’s landmass, but now down to just 5%. Drawdown envisions 287 million hectares (700 million acres – more than one-third of the land area of the lower 48) being restored to intact forest. This goal may be hampered by the recent finding that climate change is degrading tropical forests through increased extreme heat and droughts.\nThe diversity of the Project Drawdown solutions makes clear that there is no “silver bullet” to solve the climate crisis – only silver buckshot. Even the biggest individual solutions like onshore wind turbines contribute less than 10% to the overall carbon reductions in the Drawdown scenarios. That’s why Drawdown evaluates 100 different solutions.\nThe good news is that these studies show that climate solutions are investments with a high rate of return. And if the world makes those investments, the Paris targets could still be within reach."

   "paragraph": "The pros and cons of planting trees to address global warming\nPosted on 23 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Bruce Lieberman\nIt seems like such a simple, straightforward, empowering idea: plant trees – a lot of trees – all over the world, and watch the planet’s temperature fall.\nWho doesn’t love a tree or two, even far more – the right tree in the right place?\nAlong with the refreshing shade they provide on hot days, trees of course also store carbon, and they’ll suck it right out of our fragile atmosphere as they grow. Who could argue with more trees, more forests – more shade! – in a warming world? Nary a soul, one suspects, whether of conventional “tree hugger” category or rabid climate science detractor.\nEarlier this year, the one-trillion tree campaign was big news at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Salesforce founder Businessman Marc Benioff announced at the meeting that his company will “support and mobilize the conservation and restoration of 100 million trees over the next decade.”\nBack in Washington, D.C., President Trump and Republican lawmakers said they too support the international campaign – although Arkansas Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman came under fire for proposing a “Trillion Trees Act” that would pair a commitment to planting trees with a plan to increase logging on public lands. Numerous other Republican representatives are endorsing the trees effort.\nCautions against just randomly digging and planting\nOver the past few weeks, chatter has picked up that planting trees is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to combating climate change. Trees are a good thing, but:\nWe also need to protect existing forests – the Amazon, for example.\nWe need to ramp up wind, solar, and geothermal energy.\nWe need to burn less fossil fuel.\nWe need to eat more of the right foods and less of the wrong ones and, above all else, eat sustainably.\nWe need higher vehicle-mileage standards and more electric cars.\nWe need to get our act together so we can better adapt to rising seas, more droughts and wildfires, and unpredictable swings in weather.\nLike other initiatives to tackle climate change, planting trees requires some forethought. Recent news coverage of the trillion tree campaign points to several things people should be thinking about before digging and planting.\nAuthors of a 2019 study from the Swiss research university, ETH Zurich, estimated that the planet can support about 2.5 billion more acres of newly planted trees – without tearing down cities and doing away with farms. And they say those trees could store about 200 gigatons of carbon (GtC) once they mature. That’s equal to one-third of all the carbon that humans have emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide pollution, the authors claimed. The New York Times summarized the study last year.\nResearcher: ‘Nations absolutely should plant and protect as many [trees] as possible. … But it’s also a limited and unreliable way of addressing climate change.’\nScientist Zeke Hausfather, long a regular contributor to Yale Climate Connections, suggested in a series of tweets at the time that the study was misleading on a few counts. For one thing, cumulative emissions from land use and burning fossil fuels were closer to 640 GtC, “so removing 200 GtC would represent one-third of historic emissions.” Hausfather also pointed to the practical and economic challenges of planting trees on every acre of available land.\nIndia is intimately familiar with this challenge. Last summer the country planted hundreds of millions of trees as part of an initiative to keep one-third of its land area covered in trees. But the nation’s high population and rapid industrialization pose challenges to sustained reforestation. Only about 60% of the saplings are expected to survive – the rest succumbing to disease and a lack of water.\nA Skeptical Science article by Dana Nuccitelli, a regular contributor to Yale Climate Connections and an environmental scientist, cites additional studies that have raised several other key points. Among them:\nTundra and boreal regions unpopulated by trees play an important global role in reflecting energy from the sun back into space. Planting trees in these regions would darken landscapes at these high latitudes, causing them to absorb energy from the sun rather than reflect it – ultimately contributing to higher global temperatures and offsetting cooling created by planting trees.\nThe ETH Zurich researchers mistakenly considered natural savannas, grasslands, and shrublands as places where forests could be restored.\nAnd in their ETH Zurich study, they estimated a carbon sequestration rate of 0.22 GtC per million hectares (i.e., for every 2.47 million acres). But 0.22 GtC is twice the amount cited by previously published estimates.\nTrees deserve a ‘moment’ of fame, but keep reality in mind\nSo while the right kinds and numbers of tree species in the right places have lots of appeal, big questions remain over exactly what can be accomplished by planting one trillion trees – and whether it may cause more harm than good.\nJames Temple, senior editor for energy at MIT Technology Review, summed up the view of many experts in a January 28 piece when he wrote:\n“It’s great that trees are having a moment. Nations absolutely should plant and protect as many as possible. … But it’s also a limited and unreliable way of addressing climate change.”\nTemple raised a few more important points, some of which have been echoed elsewhere. Among them: trees take time to grow and reach maturity – decades and even centuries for redwoods and other behemoths that can store massive amounts of carbon. If you think you’re going to immediately offset your carbon footprint from flying across the country by planting a tree … think again.\nAnother point Temple made: You really have to work the numbers to get a true sense of the challenge. For example, he wrote, the U.S. produced 5.8 billion gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2019. To offset that much CO2 pollution, you’d have to plant a forest – and wait for it to fully mature – that is more than twice the size of Texas.\nThe one-trillion tree campaign raises still more questions for forest ecologists – one of them having to do with biodiversity. If the campaign results in what are essentially tree plantations lacking biodiversity and genetic variation, often referred to as monoculture, those artificial forests won’t get very far.\n“People are getting caught up in the wrong solution,” Forrest Fleischman of the University of Minnesota told The Verge in late January. “Instead of that guy from Salesforce saying, ‘I’m going to put money into planting a trillion trees,’ I’d like him to go and say, ‘I’m going to put my money into helping indigenous people in the Amazon defend their lands.’ That’s going to have a bigger impact.”\nA campaign to plant “one trillion trees” sounds ambitious, it sounds daring, and it sounds exciting. And in many ways it could be all of those. But keep in mind that since 2015 and just in the Sierra Nevada – that sliver of mountain habitat that runs along the spine of California – nearly 150 million trees have died, victims of drought, disease, and invasion by beetles. Warmer winters have contributed to a population explosion of these destructive insects, and it’s a story being played out across the American West where forest fires are growing in frequency and intensity.\nSo maybe we can plant a trillion trees around the globe. But if we don’t do much else about climate change, will we just be fueling the fire?\nSo maybe we can and should plant a trillion trees around the globe. Go for it. But a wide array of experts insist that if we don’t also take numerous other actions to address climate change – specifically including major cuts in fossil fuel emissions and in particular carbon dioxide – we may just be fueling the fire.\nIn the end, it comes down to more trees and lots of other actions, not to more trees or."

Credit: Biplov Bhuyan Getty Images\nSmall levels of global warming can increase the likelihood of extreme events, new research warns. That’s prompting scientists to question how accurately disasters in the recent past can be used to predict extreme events today.\nA study published Wednesday in Science Advances suggests that some research attributing climate change to individual disasters has underestimated the probability of certain extremes in the last decade. That’s especially true of unprecedented hot and wet events.\nThat’s because researchers were basing their analyses on a historical study period extending only up to the year 2005, said author Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University. As it turns out, the warming that’s occurred since then has had a big impact on global extreme events.\nIn Just 10 Years, Warming Has Increased the Odds of Disasters by Chelsea Harvey, E&E News/Scientific American, Mar 20, 2020\nToon of the Week...\nHat tip to the Stop Climate Science Denial Facebook page.\nClimate Feedback Article Review...\nArticle in The Sun misrepresents Antarctic discovery and misplaces it on map\nARTICLE: ICE-LAND Melting glaciers may have revealed lost Antarctic island – and humans are already visiting it by Charlotte Evans, The Sun, Feb 26, 2020 (Original), Mar 12, 2020 (Updated)\nREVIEW SUMMARY: This article in The Sun describes the chance discovery of a small island in Antarctica’s Pine Island Bay, which seems to have appeared in the last decade. But the article sensationally connects this with a recent record high temperature at a station elsewhere in Antarctica. While warming trends in the atmosphere and ocean may be relevant, a single weather record is not.\nIt is not yet clear what is responsible for the island’s appearance. It could be that upward motion of the bedrock—relieved of weight as the ice sheet shrinks—has raised the island above sea level. It could, instead, be that that island was previously encased in the floating ice shelf in front of the glacier on land.\nThe map presented in the article is quite inaccurate. The inset box on the map is in the wrong location, and the satellite image is of a different location that is also wrong. Pine Island Bay—and so the newly discovered island—lies more than a thousand kilometers from either of them.\nUPDATE (12 March 2020): The Sun article has been updated, removing the inaccurate map and editing the statements highlighted below. It now refers to climate trends rather than a singular weather record and qualifies statements that previously presented hypotheses as certainties.\nSee all the scientists’ annotations in context.\nArticle in The Sun misrepresents Antarctic discovery and misplaces it on map, Edited by Scott Johnson, Article Review, Climate Feedback, Mar 10, 2020\nComing Soon on SkS...\nThe pros and cons of planting trees to address global warming (Bruce Lieberman)\nEmissions: Coronavirus & Climate Change (ClimateAdam)\nSkS New Research for Week #12 (Doug Bostrom)\nScientists share their grief, anger, and hope over climate change (Greenman)\nCould the Atlantic Overturning Circulation ‘shut down’?

Vacation pics and shameless selfies have been replaced with glimpses of how we’re living through the coronavirus outbreak and its necessary quarantines: Health care officials are sharing their tips and expertise; fitness instructors are posting living-room workouts; chefs are sharing easy home-cooked meals; and others are posting about how we can all help those who are most at risk.\nIt’s a reminder of how social media keeps us connected and informed no matter where we are in the world, a fact we take for granted with every double tap. But it’s mostly a testament to the power of coming together around a crisis and taking collective action for the greater global good. In theory, practicing social distancing, washing our hands more thoroughly, and working from home can slow down this disease and eventually, hopefully, eliminate it. We’re all doing our small, if sometimes inconvenient, part, and already we’re beginning to see how our individual actions contribute to something much, much bigger than us.\nFor those involved in climate-change efforts, you might see a few through lines between our response to the coronavirus and our response (or lack thereof) to the effects of climate change. Climate scientists and activists have preached for decades that our individual choices and behaviors matter, whether you’re composting, ditching single-use plastic, buying secondhand clothes, or doing the precise opposite of all of those things—wasting food, relying on plastic water bottles and containers, shopping extravagantly.\nNow Isn’t the Time to Forget About Our Climate Change Efforts by Emily Farra, Vogue Magazine, Mar 17, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article.\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\nSun, Mar 15, 2020\nCoronavirus and climate change: 6 ways the Trump administration has botched responses to both by Dawn Stover, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Mar 11, 2020\nChanging Weather Patterns Spell Doom for Unprepared Pakistan Farmers by Xari Jalil, Climate Change, Inter Press Service (IPS), Mar 13, 2020\nAustralian Undersea Sun Cable Will Deliver Power To Singapore by 2027 by Andrea D.

   "title": "Is becoming vegan the best thing people can do to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions?",
   "paragraph": "Is becoming vegan the best thing people can do to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions?\nPosted on 19 March 2020 by Justine_Wickman\nThis is the new Advanced Rebuttal to the myth 'veganism is the best way to reduce carbon emissions' with the short URL sks.to/veganism\nAnimal agriculture and GHG emissions\nIt has been estimated that 11-15% of human caused greenhouse gas emissions are a result of animal agriculture and livestock globally (FAO 2013.; Climate watch 2018). These gases include methane from enteric fermentation of cattle, nitrous oxide mainly from manure and carbon dioxide. The levels of each that are contributed vary depending on geographical location and the source of meat. Animal agriculture also uses vast amounts of other resources like land, fertilizer, feed and water, for example 8% of global water usage is taken up by livestock (Schlink 2010).\nFigure 1: Global human caused GHG emissions divided by sector as estimated by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions 2013\nA film by Kip Anderson; ‘Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret (2014)’ rallied for veganism as being the best way to reduce GHG emissions with claims that it is the ‘solution to climate change, to stop eating animals’ and ‘the only way to sustainably and ethically live on this planet with seven billion other people is to live an entirely plant-based vegan diet.’ This message was backed up by unreliable sources, for example quoting work by Goodland (2009) that animal agriculture is responsible for 51% of GHG emissions, when it has been estimated to be 11-15% (FAO 2013., Climate watch 2018). Although veganism does have the potential to reduce GHG emissions associated with diet, it is important to consider other sectors that are also part of the problem.\nAre people willing to change their diets for the environment?\nGraça et al. (2015) showed that 60% of people have intention to change the amount of meat they consume; however, only 48.8% are actually willing to reduce their meat intake and only 44.4% are willing to completely change to a plant-based diet. Compared to other dietary changes people are willing to make to advantage the environment, only 46.9% of people are reducing their meat intake compared to 67.7% buying regional food and 62.9% eating seasonal fruit and vegetables (Tobler et al. 2011).\nEating meat is also perceived to have the least environmental impact compared to produce with excess packaging or inorganic and imported produce. This suggests that many people may not be willing to eat a plant-based diet because they do not perceive eating meat to be a large environmental issue. Global veganism would require a mass change in mindset; people that show an attachment to meat are unlikely to respond well when faced with direct approaches to try and elicit change as they will react in a defensive manner (Graça 2015). Films such as Cowspiracy may not be the most productive way to encourage reduced meat intake and may have the opposite effect of making them firmer in their reasons for eating meat (Graça 2015).\nFigure 2: Willingness and intent of people to switch to a plant based diet using data taken from Graça et al. (2015)\nProblems with the vegan diet\nAbout one-third of all food grown is lost as waste, during transport and processing as well as at the retailer and consumer level (Gustavsson et al. 2011). Food waste is a contributor to food related GHG emissions (Scarborough 2014). Fruit and vegetables make up 39% of food waste with dairy and meat making up 17% and 14% respectively (Conrad et al. 2018). It is currently estimated that 4.2 trillion gallons of irrigation water and 780 million pounds of pesticides are depleted as a result of food losses and waste, most of which are used to produce fruit and vegetables (Conrad et al. 2018). With an increase in fruit and vegetable intake with a rise in vegan diets, the contribution of fruit and vegetable waste to GHG emissions and other depleted resources is likely to rise.\nThe large contribution of this waste attributed to fruit and vegetables is a result of retailer grading on its appearance due to the consumer avoiding disfigured produce. In an attempt to reduce the environmental burden of food, a reduction in the amount of waste on an individual level, specifically fruit and vegetables, is necessary, particularly if there is an increasing amount of these high-waste products due to more people switching to a vegan diet.\nFigure 3: Proportion of waste attributed to different food groups by US consumers. Other comprises of groups all with a percentage of <10% including: candy, soft drinks, salty snacks, soup, potatoes and mixed potato dishes, nuts and seeds, Mexican dishes, eggs and mixed egg dishes, table oils and salad dressing. Data taken from Conrad et al. (2018).\nCarlsson-Kanyama (2009) showed that, ‘foods that commonly have low emissions, such as fruits, when they are transported by air, may have emissions as large as some types of meat.’ For example, domestic pork and chicken generate 9.3 and 4.3 kg of CO2-equivalent per kg of product, respectively, whereas fresh tropical fruit transported by plane generates 11 kg CO2-equivalent per kg of product. Therefore, although eating a vegan diet has the potential to reduce emissions, other types of foods that also have a large environmental impact should be reduced, which are not necessarily facilitated by a vegan diet. Heller (2013) noted the environmental impact of vegetables produced in heated greenhouses can be greater than animal-derived products, showing that it is important to think about the farming and transportation of all produce, reducing intake of out-of-season and tropical produce, not just livestock, to reduce the environmental impact of a diet.\nLand management strategies are an important factor to consider when trying to mitigate some of the emissions associated with growing fruit and vegetables. Zomer (2017) claim that \"land management strategies can increase soil carbon stocks on agricultural lands with practises including addition of organic manures, cover cropping, mulching, conservation tillage, fertility management and rotational grazing.\" The importance of this, as highlighted by Zomer (2017), is that mismanaged land can release carbon from topsoil into the atmosphere, with as estimated 50-70% of carbon soil stocks already lost in cultivated soils. Regard for the use of sustainable land management strategies with the increase in demand for non-meat produce that comes alongside veganism would be important; however, these management strategies, such as rotational grazing and organic manures, require livestock and therefore do not fit with a vegan diet. Perhaps rather than full veganism, it is necessary to consider a balance of sustainably-produced food using the land management strategies suggested by Zomer (2017).\nVegan vs. Vegetarian vs. meat diets\nA vegan diet can reduce GHG emissions by 26% compared to the average meat-eating UK diet and a vegetarian diet could see a 22% reduction (Berners-Lee 2012; Saxe 2013; Scarborough 2014). Recent research by Kim et al. (2019) compared a flexitarian two-thirds vegan diet (which involved eating vegan for 2 meals per day and no restrictions on the third meal) to a fully vegetarian diet and found that in 95% of countries studied, the two-thirds diet produced less GHG emissions than the vegetarian diet. Therefore, there are arguments that a flexitarian diet with moderate amounts of meat is better than a vegetarian diet that cuts out meat completely, showing that stopping meat intake completely does not necessarily reduce dietary GHG emissions and cannot be assumed to do so in a vegan diet.\nWhat are the alternatives?\nIncreasing understanding of livestock emissions may mean there is potential to partially mitigate the high levels of GHG emissions associated with livestock, without abandoning livestock production. For example, adding fumaric acid to goat feed has shown to reduce their methane production by 18-31% (Li 2018). However, this additive has been less successful in cattle, the largest culprits of methane gas production. Alternatively, adding seaweed (Asparagopsis armata) to the diet of dairy cow can reduce methane emissions by up to 67% (Roque et al. 2019)\nGlobal veganism has the potential to reduce global GHG emissions; however, it is not the only option and may not be the most achievable. A combination of moderated red meat, lamb, and dairy intake along with sustainable farming techniques and locally-sourced produce to avoid airfreight would have a positive impact on the environment. However, it is important not to overemphasize one source of GHG emissions, for example livestock, as it can distract from the need to reduce human-caused emissions across a range of sectors. Films like ‘Cowspiracy’ that oversimplify the problem in order to advocate a single policy outcome may be similarly counterproductive as films that deny the problem in the first place.\nRelated research\nRecent work by Allen et al. 2018 has highlighted that standardised measures of greenhouse gases such as GWP100 or GWP 20 can debated as to whether they represent accurate measurement of methane and its effects which may be may be overstated with these metrics. A future blog post discussing this is in the works.\nReferences:\nAllen, MR., Shine, KP., Fuglestvedt, JS., Millar, RJ., Cain, M., Frame, DJ., Macey, AH. (2018).

   "title": "UK’s CO2 emissions have fallen 29% over the past decade",
   "paragraph": "UK’s CO2 emissions have fallen 29% over the past decade\nPosted on 17 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Simon Evans\nThe UK’s CO2 emissions fell by 2.9% in 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis. This brings the total reduction to 29% over the past decade since 2010, even as the economy grew by a fifth.\nAnother 29% reduction in coal use last year was the driving force behind the decline in UK emissions in 2019, with oil and gas use largely unchanged. Carbon emissions from coal have fallen by 80% over the past decade, while those from gas are down 20% and oil by just 6%.\nThe 2.9% fall in 2019 marks a seventh consecutive year of carbon cuts for the UK, the longest series on record. It also means UK carbon emissions in 2019 fell to levels last seen in 1888.\nThe analysis comes as the UK – and the world – enter what needs to be a “decade of action” in the 2020s, if global goals to limit rising temperatures are to be met. Ahead of the COP26 UN climate summit this November, countries are expected to submit enhanced pledges to tackle emissions.\nBut UK government projections show the country will miss its legally binding carbon targets later this decade. To meet the UK’s carbon budgets, CO2 emissions would need to fall by another 31% by 2030, whereas government projections expect just a 10% cut, based on current policies.\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which is the UK government’s official climate advisory body, has also said the UK’s targets over the next decade are “likely” to be insufficient, given the increased goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.\nAnnual decline\nCarbon Brief’s provisional estimates suggest that the UK’s CO2 emissions fell by another 2.9% in 2019, once again driven primarily by falling coal use, as shown in the table, below.\nAnnual change in UK CO2 emissions in 2019 and over the past decade\nChange in CO2CoalOilGasTotal\nIn 2019 -27.9% -0.9% -0.1% -2.9%\nPast decade -79.8% -6.0% -20.0% -29.0%\nThe bulk of the reduction in coal use last year came from the power sector, which accounted for 93% of the overall fall in demand for the fuel in 2019. The remainder was from industry.\nCoal generation fell by close to 60% and accounted for just 2% of UK electricity last year – less than solar. Fossil fuels collectively accounted for a record-low 43% of the total, according to Carbon Brief analysis published at the start of January. Some 54% of electricity generation in the UK is now from low-carbon sources, including 37% from renewables and 20% from wind alone.\nThere were 83 days in 2019 when the UK went without coal power, including a record 18-day stretch in May. Almost all of the UK’s remaining coal power plants have announced plans to close over the next 12 months, leaving just three operating ahead of the 2024 government deadline.\nCarbon Brief’s emissions analysis shows that CO2 from burning gas remained virtually unchanged during 2019. The fuel is now the single-largest contributor to UK emissions, ahead of oil.\nGas demand for electricity generation, as well as demand to heat homes and businesses, were relatively flat, with 2019 seeing similar temperatures to those in 2018. (Both years were around 0.5C above the long-term average for 1981-2010.)\nOil demand and emissions fell by nearly 1% in 2019, Carbon Brief’s analysis suggests. This is despite rising road traffic, up 0.8% in the year to September 2019, according to separate government figures published in December.\nThe UK’s vehicle fleet is changing under several competing influences, with electric vehicle sales surging and diesel cars losing out to petrol in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal.\nSimon Evans@DrSimEvans\nTHREAD\nBattery electric vehicles have just recorded an absolutely stunning increase in their share of the UK market, which has tripled in two months to 3.4%, after 3+ yrs below 1%\nHT @colinmckerrache for flagging and @SMMT for data\n366\n2:43 AM - Sep 5, 2019\nTwitter Ads info and privacy\n258 people are talking about this\nMeanwhile, a broader global trend towards heavier vehicles, such as SUVs, means that the average CO2 emissions per mile for new UK cars has been increasing for three years. Notably, the relative mix of traffic from private cars, vans and trucks is also shifting, as discussed below.\nPast decade\nCarbon Brief’s analysis shows that the UK’s CO2 emissions have fallen by 29% over the past decade since 2010, the year when the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government took office. At the same time, the UK’s economic output has risen by 18%, as the chart below shows.\nChange in the UK’s CO2 emissions and real GDP since 2010, per cent. Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), World Bank and Carbon Brief analysis. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nLooking at international data up to 2018 – the most recent year available – the UK has seen the fastest decline in CO2 emissions of any major economy. Only the US has seen larger absolute cuts than the UK, in terms of tonnes of CO2 over this period, but its 5% decline is smaller in percentage terms.\nThe UK’s CO2 emissions in 2019 stood at an estimated 354 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), some 41% below 1990 levels.\nThis places the UK in between Australia (421MtCO2 in 2018) and Poland (344MtCO2). The UK’s per-capita CO2 emissions in 2019, at 5.3tCO2, are above the global average (4.8 in 2018) and India (2.0), but below the EU average (7.0) and the figure for China (7.2) or the US (16.6).\nAlmost all of the recent progress on UK emissions has come in the power sector, which has seen dramatic changes over the past decade. Coal use to generate electricity has plummeted thanks to reductions in demand and the rise of renewables, while gas power has also fallen slightly.\nBy way of illustration, the chart below shows that coal accounts for around three-fifths of the decline in UK CO2 emissions over the past decade. The vast majority of this – some 89% – is due to falling coal use in the power sector. (Coal use in the steel industry has halved, accounting for a further 8% of the decline in coal emissions over the past decade.)\nContributions to the change in the UK’s CO2 emissions between 2010 (leftmost column) and 2019 (right) in millions of tonnes of CO2. Source: Carbon Brief analysis of data on energy and emissions from BEIS. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nIn order to meet climate goals towards 2030, the UK’s CO2 emissions will need to fall another 31% from 2019, compared with the 29% achieved over the past decade. Emissions would need to fall even faster if the targets are raised in line with net-zero by 2050. In contrast, government projections suggest CO2 emissions will only fall by a further 10% by 2030.\n(Carbon Brief estimates that UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were some 45% below 1990 levels, against a target of 61% for the five years covering 2028-2032.)\nMoreover, coal’s share of the UK electricity mix is now so low that there is very limited scope to continue driving emissions cuts by reducing use of the fuel. This means other, more visible sectors of the economy will need to make progress for the UK to continue hitting its legally binding goals.\nAs the chart above shows, the past decade has seen much more limited progress in cutting emissions from oil (down 6%) or gas (20%), with these fuels broadly associated with transport (oil) and space heating in homes or offices (gas).\nDomestic gas use has declined by 20% since 2010, thanks to improvements in the energy efficiency of homes and regulations driving a shift to more efficient condensing boilers. Yet the majority of homes remain far short of the government’s aspirational target for higher efficiency and UK properties are among the least-well insulated in Europe.\nGas use for electricity generation has also fallen by 25% over the past decade, even as coal generation has collapsed, thanks to reduced demand and the rise of renewables.\nEmissions from oil use have remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. This is largely due to transport, which is now the single largest source of UK CO2 emissions on a sectoral basis. The country’s cars are now responsible for more CO2 than the entire power sector, for example.\nAlthough oil emissions have changed little over the past decade, this conceals some significant shifts within the transport total, thanks to shifting driving patterns and modest improvements in fuel efficiency over time.\nFor example, the number of miles driven by cars has increased by around 5% over the past decade, while CO2 emissions from cars have fallen by 3%.\nMeanwhile, the number of miles driven by “light duty vehicles”, such as delivery vans, has shot up by 23% in a decade, corresponding to a 20% rise in CO2 emissions.\nVans and trucks together make up around a third of all UK emissions from transport, with cars adding another 55% and the remainder coming from domestic aviation, shipping and railways.\nHistorical trend\nAfter a record seven consecutive years of decline, the UK’s CO2 emissions are now some 41% below 1990 levels. Outside years with general strikes, seen clearly in the chart, below, this is the lowest level since 1888, when the first-ever Football League match was played and Tower Bridge was being built near what is now Carbon Brief’s office in London.\nThe UK’s CO2 emissions 1850-2019, millions of tonnes (blue area) and the level in 2019 (dashed red line). Emissions from coal, oil and gas are shown from 1970 onwards. Source: BEIS, Carbon Brief analysis and the World Resources Institute CAIT data explorer. The CAIT data has been adjusted because it excludes emissions from land use and forestry. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nAlthough no other country in the world has achieved similar reductions, it is worth emphasising that the UK was the first to industrialise. As such, its cumulative historical emissions still rank as the fourth-highest in the world.\nReasons for change\nIf the UK’s energy system had remained unchanged over the past decade, then the country’s rising population and economic growth would have driven emissions higher, rather than lower.\nThis is shown in the chart, below, which breaks down the reasons for the dramatic reduction in emissions that has actually occurred.\nThe largest contributor to falling emissions over the past decade has been improvements in energy intensity, which is the amount of energy needed to produce each unit of GDP. Broadly speaking, this reflects the fact that the UK has become much more energy efficient.\nThe second-largest contributor has been a shift to cleaner fuels, primarily renewable sources of electricity. Together, these effects have more than offset the impact of rising population and GDP.\nContributions to the change in UK CO2 emissions between 2010 (leftmost column) and 2019 (right) in millions of tonnes of CO2. “Cleaner fuels” is shorthand for the carbon intensity of energy and “energy efficiency” is shorthand for the energy intensity of GDP. “Interaction effects” result from changes in one factor, such as energy intensity, influencing the impact of changes in other factors. Source: Carbon Brief analysis of data on energy and emissions from BEIS, population data from the World Bank and UK real GDP estimates from the World Bank. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nThe various factors in the chart above are estimated from a “Kaya identity”, according to which emissions are the product of population, multiplied by GDP per capita, multiplied by the energy intensity of GDP, multiplied by the CO2 intensity of energy.\nCO2 = P x GDP/capita x energy/GDP x CO2/energy\nTo calculate the relative contributions to changing emissions, each factor is systematically varied while holding other elements constant. For example, the Kaya identity can be used to estimate what UK CO2 emissions would have been in 2019, if population had remained at 2010 levels.\nAs noted in the caption to the figure, above, the chart labels are a shorthand. Specifically, changes in the energy intensity of GDP, labelled as “energy efficiency”, are a reflection of genuine demand reductions – due to more efficient products and processes – but they also reflect the increasing share of energy coming from renewable sources.\nReceive our free Daily Briefing for a digest of the past 24 hours of climate and energy media coverage, or our Weekly Briefing for a round-up of our content from the past seven days. Just enter your email below:\nDaily + Weekly\ndaily brief\nweekly brief\nThis is because a large part of the “primary energy” contained in raw fossil fuels – a lump of coal, for example – is lost as waste heat when the fuel is burned to produce useful energy. The same is not true of electricity from windfarms or solar panels, which, therefore, has a lower energy intensity.\nCarbon Brief calculations\nCarbon Brief’s estimates of the UK’s CO2 emissions in 2019 are based on analysis of provisional energy use figures published by BEIS on 28 February 2020. The same approach has accurately estimated year-to-year changes in emissions in previous years (see table, below).\nEstimated year-on-year change in UK CO2 emissions versus reported results\nReportedCarbon BriefDifference\n2010 3.6% 4.0% 0.4%\n2011 -8.6% -8.1% 0.5\n2012 4.1% 4.3% 03.%\n2013 -2.2% -3.9% -1.7%\n2014 -8.4% -8.6% -0.2%\n2015 -3.9% -3.4% 0.5%\n2016 -5.5% -6.3% -0.7%\n2017 -3.3% -2.4% 0.8%\n2018 -2.4% -2.0% 0.4%\n2019 -2.9%\nOne large source of uncertainty is the provisional energy use data, which BEIS revises at the end of March each year and often again later on. Emissions data is also subject to revision in light of improvements in data collection and the methodology used.\nThe table above applies Carbon Brief’s emissions calculations to the latest energy use and emissions figures, which may differ from those published previously.\nAnother source of uncertainty is the fact that Carbon Brief’s approach to estimating the annual change in CO2 output differs from the methodology used for the BEIS provisional estimates. This is largely because BEIS has access to more granular data, which is not available for public use.\nHowever, Carbon Brief understands that its methodology has over the past year been used to improve the early “pre-provisional” estimates produced by the department for internal use, prior to the release of full provisional figures at the end of March each year.\nIn Carbon Brief’s approach, UK CO2 emissions are estimated by multiplying the reported consumption of each fossil fuel, in energy terms, by its emissions factor. This is the amount of CO2 released for each unit of energy consumed and it varies for different fuels.\nFor example, diesel, petrol and jet fuel have different emissions factors and Carbon Brief’s analysis accounts for this where possible. This adjustment is based on the quantity of each fuel type used per year, drawn from separate BEIS figures covering oil, coal and gas.\nEmissions from land use and forestry are assumed to remain at the same level as in 2018. This year, Carbon Brief adopted the BEIS approach to estimating the change in emissions from greenhouse gases other than CO2.\nNote that the figures in this article are for emissions within the UK measured according to international guidelines. This means they exclude emissions associated with imported goods, including imported biomass, as well as the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) has published detailed comparisons between various different approaches to calculating UK emissions, on a territorial, consumption, environmental accounts or international accounting basis.\nThe UK’s consumption-based CO2 emissions increased between 1990 and 2007. Since then, however, they have fallen by a similar number of tonnes as emissions within the UK. Carbon Brief estimates that consumption-based CO2 emissions fell by around 21% over the past decade.\nBioenergy is a significant source of renewable energy in the UK and its climate benefits are disputed. Contrary to public perception, however, only around one quarter of bioenergy is imported.\nInternational aviation is considered part of the UK’s carbon budgets and faces the prospect of tighter limits on its CO2 emissions. The international shipping sector recently agreed to at least halve its emissions by 2050, relative to 2008 levels."

But “possible” doesn’t mean “probable.”\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) has produced a remarkable new video using data gathered from their Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, which specifically tracks atmospheric air pollution. The images reveal a sharp and sudden decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over Italy from January to mid-February, which scientists believe is tied to the reduction in human activity in the nation due to the coronavirus outbreak. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte ordered a lockdown across northern Italy on March 8 to try to contain the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19.\nHigh concentrations of NO2, a highly reactive gas that forms from vehicle emissions and power plants, can harm the respiratory systems of humans and animals, aggravating respiratory diseases like asthma and increasing the risk of respiratory infection.

   "paragraph": "Multi-agency report highlights increasing signs and impacts of climate change in atmosphere, land and oceans\nPosted on 13 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from the WMO\nNew York / Geneva, 10 March 2020 - The tell-tale physical signs of climate change such as increasing land and ocean heat, accelerating sea level rise and melting ice are highlighted in a new report compiled by the World Meteorological Organization and an extensive network of partners. It documents impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.\nThe WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019 includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, leading international experts, scientific institutions and United Nations agencies. The flagship report provides authoritative information for policy makers on the need for Climate Action.\nThe report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the UN Climate Change Conference in December that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.\n2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Niño event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.\n“We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5°C or 2°C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,” said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a foreword.\n“This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action. It brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change – from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement,” he said.\nThe report will be launched at a press conference given by the UN Secretary-General and WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at UN headquarters on 10 March.\n“Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,” said WMO Secretary-General Taalas.\n“We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Reported record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise,” said Mr Taalas.\n“Temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. Changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. Sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in Greenland and Antarctica. This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas,” said Mr Taalas.\nClimate indicators\nGreenhouse Gases\nIn 2018, greenhouse gas mole fractions reached new highs, with globally averaged mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) at 407.8±0.1 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at 1869±2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 331.1±0.1 ppb. Preliminary data indicates that greenhouse gas concentrations continued to increase in 2019.\nA preliminary projection of global fossil CO2 emissions using data from the first three quarters of 2019, suggests that emissions would grow +0.6% in 2019 (with a range of -0.2% to +1.5%).\nOceans\nMarine heatwaves\nMore than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.\nOcean warming has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. It is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems.\nIn 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly 2 months of unusually warm temperatures. At least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.\nOcean Acidification: In the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual CO2 emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. The change of pH reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.\nOcean Deoxygenation: both observations and models indicate that oxygen is declining in the open and coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the middle of the last century, there has been an estimated 1%–2% decrease (77 billion–145 billion tons) in the global ocean oxygen inventory.\nMarine Ecosystems: Deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5°C warming, and to less than 1% at 2°C warming.\nSea level has risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record.\nIce: The continued long-term decline of Arctic sea ice was confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.\nUntil 2016, Antarctic sea ice extent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.\nThe Greenland ice sheet has recorded nine of the 10 lowest surface mass balance years in the last 13 years. And 2019 was the 7th lowest on record. In terms of total mass balance. Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 458 Gt in 2011/12. The loss in 2019 was 329 Gt, well above the average.\nGlaciers: Preliminary results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.\nClimate-related Impacts\nThe report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. This is based on input from a wide variety of United Nations partners. (See in Editor’s note for full list)\nHealth\nExtreme heat conditions are taking an increasing toll on human health and health systems.\nIn 2019, record-setting high temperatures from Australia, India, Japan, and Europe negatively affected health and well-being. In Japan, a major heat wave event resulted in over 100 deaths and an additional 18 000 hospitalizations. In France over 20 000 emergency room were recorded for heat-related illnesses between June and mid-September and during two major summer heatwaves, there were a total of 1 462 excess deaths in the affected regions.\nChanges in global vectorial capacity for dengue virus vectors,\ncalculate using historical climate data.\nChanges in climatic conditions since 1950 are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit dengue virus, increasing the risk of the occurrence of disease. In parallel, the global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, and about half of the world population is now at risk of infection. In 2019, the world experienced a large increase in dengue cases.\nFood Security\nClimate variability and extreme weather events are among the key drivers of the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe crises. After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018. Among 33 countries affected by food crises in 2018, climate variability and weather extremes a compounding driver together with economic shocks and conflict in 26 countries and the leading driver in 12 of the 26. In light of this, the global community faces an enormous challenge to meet the Zero Hunger target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe food security situation deteriorated markedly in 2019 in some countries of the Greater Horn of Africa due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people, (6.7 million in Ethiopia, 3.1 million in Kenya, 2.1 million in Somalia, 4.5 million in South Sudan, 5.8 million in the Sudan) were estimated to be severely food insecure, only slightly lower than during the severe and prolonged drought in 2016-17.\nThere was exceptional dryness in March and much of April followed by unusually heavy rainfall and floods in October-December. The unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa region - the worst in over 25 years, and the most serious in 70 years for Kenya. This is expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.\nDisplacement\nMore than 6.7 million new internal disaster displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, triggered by hydrometeorological events such as Cyclone Idai in Southeast Africa, Cyclone Fani in South Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. This number was forecast to reach close to 22 million in 2019, up from 17.2 million in 2018. Of all natural hazards, floods and storms contributed most to displacement.\nHigh impact events\nFloods\nMore than 2 200 lives were reported to have been lost in various flooding episodes in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar during the monsoon season, which started late but finished with rainfall totals above the long-term average.\nThe 12-month rainfall averaged over the contiguous United States for the period for July 2018 to June 2019 (962 mm) was the highest on record. Total economic losses from flooding in the United States in 2019 were estimated at US$20 billion.\nVery wet conditions affected parts of South America in January. There was major flooding in northern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran was badly affected by flooding in late March and early April. Major flooding affected many hitherto drought-affected parts of east Africa in October and early November.\nDrought\nDrought affected many parts of southeast Asia and Australia, which had its driest year on record, influenced by the strong positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole.\nSouthern Africa, Central America and parts of South America received abnormally low precipitation amounts.\nHeatwaves\nAustralia finished the year where it started: with extreme heat. The 2018-2019 summer was the hottest on record, as was December. Australia's hottest area-averaged day on record (41.9°C ) was on 18 December. Australia's seven hottest days on record, and nine of the 10 hottest, occurred in 2019.\nTwo major heatwaves occurred in Europe in late June and late July. In France, a national record of 46.0°C (1.9°C above the previous record) was set on 28 June at Vérargues. National records were also set in Germany (42.6°C), the Netherlands (40.7°C), Belgium (41.8°C), Luxembourg (40.8°C) and the United Kingdom (38.7°C), with the heat also extending into the Nordic countries, where Helsinki had its highest temperature on record (33.2°C on 28 July).\nWildfires\nIt was an above-average fire year in several high-latitude regions, including Siberia (Russian Federation) and Alaska (US), with fire activity occurring in some parts of the Arctic where it was previously extremely rare.\nThe severe drought in Indonesia and neighbouring countries led to the most significant fire season since 2015. The number of reported fires in Brazil’s Amazonia region was only slightly above the 10-year average, but total fire activity in South America was the highest since 2010, with Bolivia and Venezuela among the countries with particularly active fire years.\nAustralia experienced an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season in the later part of 2019 with repeated major outbreaks which continued into January 2020. As of early 2020, 33 deaths had been reported and over 2000 properties had been lost, while a total of about 7 million hectares had been burnt in New South Wales and Victoria.\nDaily total wildfire CO2 emissions generally followed the 2003-2018 average, according to the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation System dataset. The largest increases above the 17-year mean in July, August, September and the end of December corresponding to the peak activity of wildfires in the Arctic/Siberia, Indonesia and Australia respectively.\nTropical cyclones\nTropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was above average. The Northern Hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones. The 2018-19 Southern Hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones.\nTropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March as one of the strongest known on the east coast of Africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. Idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780 000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. The cyclone also resulted in at least 50 905 displaced persons in Zimbabwe, 53 237 in southern Malawi and 77 019 in Mozambique.\nOne of the year’s most intense tropical cyclones was Dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the Bahamas. The destruction was worsened as it was exceptionally slow-moving and remained near-stationary for about 24 hours.\nTyphoon Hagibis made landfall west of Tokyo on 12 October, causing severe flooding."

   "title": "World’s intact tropical forests reached ‘peak carbon uptake’ in 1990s",
   "paragraph": "World’s intact tropical forests reached ‘peak carbon uptake’ in 1990s\nPosted on 10 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Simon Lewis\nThe world’s land surface currently removes around 30% of all human-generated CO2 emissions, with tropical forests playing a major role in this “carbon sink”.\nOf particular importance are intact tropical forests, which, according to a landmark paper published in 2011, absorbed 15% of all human-generated CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2007.\nThis research found that intact tropical forests that are undisturbed by either logging or fires were, on average, getting larger over time – thought to be driven by rising atmospheric CO2 levels boosting photosynthesis.\nHowever, new research published this week in Nature, by myself and colleagues, paints a much more alarming picture of the role of tropical forests in slowing climate change.\nUtilising two large forest datasets in Africa and South America spanning 300,000 trees, we show that the carbon sink in tropical forest is in rapid decline.\nIn fact, according to our analysis, the ability of intact tropical forests to remove CO2 from the atmosphere reached its peak in the 1990s and has since been in decline.\nTropical turmoil\nForests act as a net carbon sink when the amount of carbon gained through tree growth and the establishment of new trees is larger than the amount lost through tree mortality.\nTo evaluate how the sink is evolving over time, we made use of tree data stretching back 30 years. Every few years in the study period, research teams measured every tree in 565 patches of intact forest across the Amazon, the Congo Basin and West Africa.\nThe results show that, in the 1990s, the average undisturbed tropical forest removed 0.57 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year from the atmosphere. But this figure declined to an estimated 0.38 tonnes of carbon by the 2010s.\nThis is a one-third reduction in the carbon sink strength of intact tropical forests in just two decades.\nIf we extrapolate our results to consider all of the planet’s remaining intact tropical forests, we find that carbon uptake peaked at 1.26bn tonnes of carbon per year in the 1990s. This figure represents around 17% of all human-generated CO2 emissions at that time.\nBy the 2010s, the global uptake ability of tropical forests declined to 0.68bn tonnes of carbon per year. This is equivalent to just 6% of human-caused CO2 emissions in the 2010s.\nIt is worth noting that, over the study period, both the per unit area sink strength declined by 33% and the area of intact tropical forest declined by 19%, which also reduced the total rate of carbon uptake.\nTropical forests are still an important carbon sink. However, according to our results, the feared sink-to-source transition of one on Earth’s major carbon sinks has begun. This is decades earlier than any climate-driven vegetation model has predicted.\nDying trees\nTo understand why the carbon sink is decreasing, we analysed various factors that could be affecting tree growth and death.\nModels typically predict that rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere will boost plant growth. This is because plants use CO2 during photosynthesis, the process needed to fix carbon to grow trunks, branches, roots and leaves. The impact of rising CO2 levels on plant growth is known as the “CO2 fertilisation effect”.\nOur analysis shows, for the first time using inventory data, that across Africa and the Amazon, more CO2 in the atmosphere is boosting forest growth and this effect is not diminishing over time – just as models predicted.\nReceive our free Daily Briefing for a digest of the past 24 hours of climate and energy media coverage, or our Weekly Briefing for a round-up of our content from the past seven days. Just enter your email below:\nHowever, despite the CO2 fertilisation effect, the sink is in decline.\nThis is because of the climate impacts of rising CO2 levels. Namely, higher temperatures and stronger drought conditions are slowing plant growth – and killing trees.\nOverall, our analysis reveals that the balance of the ongoing positive impact of CO2 on photosynthesis and the increasingly negative impacts of temperature and drought is progressively moving in the direction of shutting down the sink over time.\nAnother factor playing a role is the life history of trees. Dynamic forests where trees die younger see their carbon sink saturating sooner than less dynamic forests, which tend to be dominated by very large trees.\nAfrica vs Amazonia\nAs part of our analysis, we looked at how the rate of carbon uptake differs between the world’s two largest areas of intact tropical forest: the Amazon region and in equatorial Africa.\nOur results show that the Amazon sink started declining first, starting in the 1990s, followed by Africa, where we see a sink decline in the best-monitored plots beginning about 2010.\nAmazon forests are declining earlier and faster than African forests because of three groups of factors.\nFirst, trees in Amazonia tend to be more dynamic than those in Africa, with trees dying at a higher rate, meaning that past gains growth leave the system sooner resulting in an earlier saturating sink.\nSecond, the Amazon tends to experience higher temperatures because it is closer to sea level, faster temperature rises, and more frequent and severe droughts than African forests have experienced over recent decades.\nThird, Amazon forest species appear less resistant to droughts than African forests. This may be because of the long-term climate history of African forests. The region has weathered large range contractions in glacial periods of Earth’s history, leaving more adaptable species that have survived past episodes of rapid environmental change.\nOverall, African forests are more robust to recent contemporary environmental change than Amazon forests, our analysis suggests. While African forests cover much less area than Amazon forests, for the period 2000-10, the carbon sink was the same on both continents.\nForest forecast\nFor the final part of our study, we used the knowledge gleaned from our datasets to construct statistical models for forecasting changes to future tropical forest carbon uptake.\nUsing future CO2, temperature and rainfall estimates alongside our models, we predict that, on average, the per unit area carbon sink in African forest will be 14% smaller by 2030 compared to 2010-15 levels, while the average Amazon forest sink will reach zero by 2035.\nParts of the intact Amazon that are affected by drought could turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source, according to our analysis. This will be because carbon losses from tree mortality overtake carbon gains from growth.\nOverall, we predict a sink-to-source transition of one of Earth’s major carbon sinks, with the Amazonia sink saturating first, followed later by the African sink.\nThe chart below shows how the ability of African forests (blue) and Amazonian forests (red) to uptake carbon is projected to change by 2040, calculated using our measurement-based statistical models.\n(The chart also shows how our measurement-based assessment of carbon uptake in Amazonian and African forests from 1990 to present compares with projections from statistical models, which are shown in light blue for Africa and pink for Amazonia.)\nEstimates and projections of tropical carbon sinks. The study’s measurement-based estimates of carbon uptake in Amazonia and Africa are shown in red and blue, respectively. Light blue and pink show projections from statistical models. Source: Rammig et al. (2020) Data source: Hubau et al. (2020)\nPolicy implications\nOur findings highlight several key messages for policymakers. First, on-the-ground tropical forest monitoring programs need funding, as the changes we predict are subtle and cannot be deduced from satellite data alone.\nSecond, tropical forests matter. For now, they are still a carbon sink and will always be a large store of carbon. Forests’ resistance to climate change is relatively high if left undisturbed. Controlling logging and fires is essential.\nThird, the need to reduce emissions to net zero just got more urgent. If society leaves it too late to tackle emissions, nature will make the job of controlling climate change much more difficult.\nFinally, avoiding a transition to a carbon source will require stabilising the climate by reaching net-zero emissions. If tropical forests sequester less carbon than models predict, an earlier date by which to reach net zero will be required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nHubau, W. et al.

   "title": "CSLDF publishes guides to scientific integrity at federal agencies",
   "paragraph": "CSLDF publishes guides to scientific integrity at federal agencies\nPosted on 9 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from the CSLDF blog\nThe Climate Science Legal Defense Fund has launched a series of guides to scientific integrity at nine federal agencies. The guides will help researchers understand their employer’s policy and navigate the process of filing a scientific integrity complaint. They also reveal which agencies have strong policies and where the policies are lacking.\nGuides are freely available as a single publication, and individually for the following agencies:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)\nDepartment of Energy (DOE)\nDepartment of the Interior (DOI)\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nNational Science Foundation (NSF)\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nScientific Integrity Policies at a Glance: Strengths and Weaknesses\nThe importance of strong agency scientific integrity policies has become clear as science at federal agencies has reached a “crisis point” under the Trump administration. We’ve documented 270 attacks on science by the federal government since November 2016 in the Silencing Science Tracker, our project with the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. A number of these actions, such as the September 2019 series of events at NOAA known as SharpieGate, are unmistakable violations of agency scientific integrity policies.\nThere are drastic differences among the nine scientific integrity policies we evaluated; many policies are missing critical aspects of scientific integrity.\nWe rated the main components of each policy to help scientists understand a policy’s usefulness (see the table on pages four and five of the compilation). A “very good” rating means the policy addresses the topic comprehensively, and the language is tailored to the agency and its scientific work. At the low end of the scale, “not addressed” means the policy is silent on a given topic.\nThese ratings enabled us to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the nine policies. Overall, they suffer from a lack of organization and user-friendliness. So even when a policy addresses an issue, the information may be of limited value to scientists. Many policies merely consolidate information via links to other resources and don’t discuss how the information might form a unified scientific integrity policy.\nBelow we highlight how the policies deal with crucial aspects of scientific integrity and where they’re lacking.\nPolitical Interference\nMost agencies have at least some protections for dealing with political interference in research. The NOAA policy is among the best because it explicitly prohibits officials from directing scientists or other NOAA employees to suppress or alter scientific findings. At the other end of the spectrum, the CDC fails to address political interference at all, an unsettling omission given the nature of the agency’s work.\nOnly the DOE, EPA, and NOAA policies address threats and intimidation to research, which is particularly discouraging in our current political environment.\nWhistleblower Protections\nThe nine agencies we reviewed all fall short regarding whistleblower protections. Only the EPA and NASA policies achieved a “good” rating. The other seven agencies received a “fair” grade for mentioning existing protections, although they fail to elaborate further. Given the attitude of the Trump administration toward science and high-profile whistleblowers in the press, this is a concerning omission.\nScience Communication\nCommunication of agency science is a primary focus of many scientific integrity policies. Most policies emphasize making data and results public, while the rights of scientists concerning their communications are less clear. The DOE is the only agency that provides adequate guidance on the use of social media. The DOD and NASA policies don’t mention social media at all; four agencies—the CDC, DOI, EPA, and NSF—address social media in separate documents, but their policies don’t mention that these exist.\nAnother critical aspect of science communication, the right of scientists to review and correct agency communications, is only addressed by the policies of the DOE, EPA, and NOAA—the remaining six agencies don’t address the topic.\nScientific Integrity Complaints\nThe nine policies reviewed differ the most in their treatment of scientific integrity complaints and how these are addressed. Only three agencies—DOI, NOAA, and the USDA—have detailed complaint procedures in place. Yet the DOI policy falls short on the adjudication process by failing to discuss who adjudicates a claim.\nThe other six policies fail to describe procedures for investigating claims that scientific integrity was violated. However, of these, most provide links to the relevant regulations on research misconduct investigations. While these regulations provide an overview of the investigation process, it’s not clear whether the procedures apply to claims of scientific integrity violations that fall outside research misconduct, such as political interference or censorship.\nHow Scientific Integrity Violations are Handled\nThe policies vary widely in how violations of scientific integrity or research misconduct are handled. Only five of the nine agencies reviewed detail the remedies for violations; the DOD, DOE, DOI, and NOAA are entirely silent, which is a troubling oversight. Knowing what happens when a policy is violated helps clarify the potential severity and enables scientists and other agency employees to understand the importance of maintaining scientific integrity. Describing the remedies also holds the agency accountable to consistent standards.\nOnly five of the nine agencies we surveyed make the results of scientific integrity investigations public—a major shortcoming. Such examples are a valuable resource for scientists with questions about bringing forward a scientific integrity complaint.\nWhat Agency Scientists Should Know About Scientific Integrity\nAgency scientists should consider familiarity with scientific integrity principles a crucial part of their jobs. These policies can ensure that the work of federal scientists isn’t censored or altered for political reasons and that the science relied on by these agencies for decision-making is free of fraud, fabrication, plagiarism, and other issues.\nEven when the policies fail, engaging with the process can establish a record of how and why a policy didn’t provide the protections it should, which can lay the groundwork for stronger protections for scientific integrity.\nOur guides contain tips and best practices for scientists from all disciplines, but they aren’t a substitute for legal advice. Researchers facing scientific issues are urged to contact us for advice about their situation. Our attorneys work with scientists accused of violating scientific integrity, and those who believe scientific integrity was violated; they also file scientific integrity complaints on behalf of federal scientists.\nWrite to lawyer@csldf.org to request a free, confidential consultation with a CSLDF attorney."

That’s especially true for the women.\n(Illustration: Alex Nabaum c/o THEISPOT)\nJust months after the Alberta NDP’s surprise 2015 election win, Shannon Phillips, the province’s new environment minister, travelled to Paris for what would turn out to be a historic round of global climate change negotiations. Alberta had long been a climate laggard, but Phillips was an ambitious and relatively young force in the province’s politics—39 years old at the time—and she was part of a wave of fresh faces in leadership. Phillips landed in Paris alongside Alberta’s new premier, Rachel Notley, and Canada’s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who were both committed to taking big steps after a decade of foot-dragging under Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.\nIt was an exciting time to be a cabinet minister working on climate change—the meeting produced what’s known as the Paris Agreement, the first major international pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions since the Kyoto Protocol nearly 20 years earlier. And right away, Phillips noticed a remarkable detail about the negotiations: the number of women present. At every meeting, the tables were crowded with female ministers, female negotiators, female scientists and activists.\n“A massive amount of the heavy lifting around the world on this matter is being done by women,” says Phillips, who still represents her Lethbridge-West riding in the Alberta legislature. “You see more women on panels. You see more women in the negotiating spaces. You see more women in leadership positions on climate.”\nWomen Fighting Climate Change Are Targets For Misogynists by Chris Turner, Chatelaine, Mar 5, 2020\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\nSun, Mar 1, 2020\nRed-state Utah embraces plan to tackle climate crisis in surprising shift by Andre Smardon, Environment, Utah, Feb 21, 2020\nSwitzerland joins few nations confirming to UN it will enhance climate action plans by Chloé Farand, Climate Home News, Feb 25, 2020\nCollinsville: the Queensland town on the frontline of the coal wars by Ben Smee & Ben Butler, Environment, Guardian, Feb 28, 2020\nAustralia on the frontline: ask an expert about climate change and its effects by Marni Cordell & Adam Morton, Environment, Guardian, Feb 29, 2020\nVW to Hire ‘Aggressive’ Climate Activist to Scrutinize Policies by Christoph Rauwald, Climate Adaption, Bloomberg News, Feb 25, 2020\nClimate change is not only worrying kids; it’s making them angry by Alfred Lubrano, Life, Philadelphia Inquirer, Feb 28, 2020\nU.S. senators unveil bill to support renewable and nuclear power, efficiency by Timothy Gardner, Environment, Reuters, Feb 27, 2020\nCurrent climate warming is rapid and occurring on a global scale, unlike past periods of regional climate fluctuations, Edited by Katy Dynarski, Climate Feedback, Feb 21, 2020\nMon, Mar 2, 2020\nEXCLUSIVE-Norway wealth fund could blacklist four major climate culprits by Gwladys Fouche, Reuters, Mar 1, 2020\nLuxembourg becomes first country to make public transport free by Kate Abnett, Reuters, Feb 29, 2020\nCoronavirus: Space images reveal drastic fall in pollution over China as factories closed by Jane Dalton, The independent (UK), Mar 1, 2020\nScience Is Already Being Disrupted by Climate Change, And We're Woefully Unprepared by Carlee Cassella, Science Alert, Mar 1, 2020\nA Trump Insider Embeds Climate Denial in Scientific Research by Hiroko Tabuchi, Climate, New York Times, March 2, 2020\nHow scientists wrestle with grief over climate change by Jonathan Lambert, ScienceNews, Feb 25, 2020\nClimate change: how do I cope with our planet’s inevitable decline? by Neil Levy, The Conversation UK, Feb 27, 2020\nCan We Really Combat Climate Change by Consuming Less?

   "paragraph": "How I try to break climate silence\nPosted on 6 March 2020 by BaerbelW\nWhen it comes to climate change many people are still hesitant to talk about it even though many experts have stated that it's important to break \"climate silence\" whenever an opportunity presents itself. For example, here is how John Cook put it in the article 16 Sustainability Leaders Weigh In: How YOU Can Help To Reverse Global Warming:\n\"The most effective thing we can do as individuals to fight global warming is break the climate silence. Talk to our friends, family, and most importantly, our elected officials – letting them know we care about the issue of climate change and want to hand over a safe world to our children. It’s only by building social and political momentum that we will make the needed transition to clean, renewable society.”\nFrom Jill Kubit:\n\"From my perspective, talking about climate change is the single most effective thing that you can do.\nBy this, I don’t mean having an argument with someone in your family who disagrees. I mean thinking deeply about why you care about climate change – why this matters to you – and then sharing this perspective with your own friends and family and with your community. This action – talking about climate in an authentic, personal way – helps normalize the idea that climate change is an important, urgent issue and breaks the invisibility or climate silence that currently exists within our culture. [...]\"\nFrom Katharine Hayhoe:\n\"The single most important thing we can do about climate change is, talk about it!\nStudies have shown that not even 25 percent of people in the U.S. hear somebody else talk about climate change more than once or twice a year. The biggest challenge we face isn’t science denial. It’s complacency: nobody thinks climate change is going to affect them personally, and why would they if we never talk about it? [...]\"\nBy now, I guess that you get the gist! There's even a cartoon for this in John's new book \"Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change\":\nAnybody who knows me, will be aware that I'm all for \"breaking climate silence\" and will do just that given half a chance! So, the rest of this blog post will list some of the things I do or at least try in order to break climate silence. Please use the comments to share how you try to do it and what - if any feedback - you received.\nSome recurring activities\nOn Fridays - in support of \"Fridays for Future\" - I often go to the office wearing some climate-themed apparel like a t-shirt and scarf printed with Ed Hawkins' climate stripes. Colleagues sometimes comment on the colorful scarf without realising what the stripes signify and this then presents a small opportunity to \"talk climate\". As a t-shirt - even if long-sleeved - is too cold during winter, I also have the \"uncozy sweater\" from WWF Switzerland which on first sight just looks like a very colorful sweater to wear during winter. But, if colleagues take a closer look they quickly get what it's all about.\nIn the company I work for we have a little program called \"Mystery Lunch\". This is basically a platform to organise \"blind dates\" to have lunch together with a colleague from another department you normally wouldn't have much contact with in the course of your daily work. One obvious purpose is to network and to get to know people and a little bit about the processes from other areas of the company. But, there's usually also ample time to talk about non-work related topics, like each other's spare time activities. To by now most likely nobody's surprise I use this to bring up my climate-related activities which thus far have always shown to pique my colleague's interest. It also comes in handy that my office isn't far away from the main cafeteria, so I'm usually able to hand out a flyer about Skeptical Science I just happen to have lyinging around on my desk before we say our good-byes!\nAt least once or twice per year, I offer a climate-themed tour through our local zoological and botanical garden \"Wilhelma\" in Stuttgart. During the 90 minutes tour I explain the basics of climate science like the greenhouse effect and how some of the species we have at the Wilhelma are already or will most likely be affected in the future by climate change. I've been doing these tours since 2014 and to learn more about them, please check my blog post \"From Pole to Pole - a climate-themed tour through a zoo\". The feedback I get at the end is positive and - from what I can tell - more engaged than when I present basically the same material in a lecture room (at least if the weather is cooperative and it's neither to hot or wet outside!).\nSome other activities\nLast year, I got the impromptu opportunity to host a 30-minute long \"unconference\" session while at the SAP TechEd conference in Barcelona and used that to \"Talk about climate science to break climate silence\" with eight other conference attendees on a Thursday morning. I'm already hoping for a repeat opportunity at this year's conference to perhaps introduce others to the Cranky Uncle app!\nAt the end of November I got the chance to do a presentation during a SAP Community call titled \"Taking on fake news about climate science\". The video below is a pre-recording of the presentation which is available as a PDF-file for download here.\nBy now, I have different versions of this presentation readily available in both English and German which I can then easily adapt as opportunities to do a presentation or workshop come up. Thus far, this year, I've used the somewhat more technical version during a workshop for Scientists for Future and the version geared towards a more general audience at an event for our local conservation group. The presentation material is all based on slide-decks originally created by John Cook who is kind enough to create versions for me without any text on them to make translating them into German a lot easier.\nAnother small thing I'm trying out now that John Cook's Cranky Uncle book is available is having a copy lying on my office desk at work to see if it'll pique my colleagues' interest enough to actually pick it up and leaf through it (of course during breaks!). If they do, it'll be yet another opportunity to talk climate!\nAs you can see, there's quite some small and - admittedly - not so small stuff you can do to try to break climate silence. Not everything will be something to try for everybody, but it's nonetheless worthwhile to start with an activity you feel comfortable with and to not be discouraged when there's no immediately visible impact or feedback. You'll never know until you actually try and you may just be surprised by the reactions you get!"

   "title": "The potential climate consequences of China's Belt and Roads Initiative",
   "paragraph": "The potential climate consequences of China's Belt and Roads Initiative\nPosted on 3 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Jan Ellen Spiegel\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative is big. Really big. Potentially the most ambitious and widespread international infrastructure development effort ever, involving rail lines, highways, power plants, pipe lines, ports, and more.\nSeriously – ever.\nGiven the Chinese government’s penchant for obfuscation and lack of transparency, it can be a little hard to tell just how precise the term “BRI”, as it is known, really is; or whether it’s more of a branding label slapped on anything that might fit.\nThat said, BRI investment so far is estimated to be somewhere between $1 and $8 trillion, encompassing hundreds of projects, with 125 countries said to have agreements with China as of mid 2019 – though estimates now are around 140, involving projects worldwide.\nAmong the many concerns BRI is generating around the world are ones coming from the environmental community. That sector largely views a significant percentage of the wide-ranging BRI projects that have played out so far as having profound impacts related to climate change. And mostly they’re not talking good impacts.\nImpacts on land use, wildlife, water quality and more\n“What China is selling is the China development model, which was energy-intense, no holds barred,” says Jennifer Turner, director of the China Environment Forum at the Woodrow Wilson Center. “But China’s not taking their war on pollution on the road even though that could be an opportunity.”\nSo while China is on track to meet its climate goals under the Paris agreement ahead of schedule, analyses undertaken by a number of government-backed interests, NGOs, and academic organizations worldwide point to direct and indirect environmental impacts – almost all of them harms – from BRI. The projects involve everything from land use to wildlife and habitat disruption to water concerns to mineral extraction to industrial effects to pollution.\nBut nothing engenders more concern than how the Chinese are using BRI to perpetuate the use of coal and other fossil fuels – pretty much everywhere BRI touches, except inside China itself. And that means increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\nDoing more good things … but not fewer bad things\n“China is doing more good things but it’s not doing fewer bad things,” says Elizabeth Losos, senior fellow at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions. She was the lead author on the study “Reducing Environmental Risks from Belt and Road Initiative Investments in Transportation Infrastructure,” done in conjunction with the World Bank. “The bad things are still greatly outweighing the good things. And I think that’s the concern of the environmental community.”\nBelt and Road – originally called One Belt, One Road, OBOR – was officially unveiled by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2013, though China had already been engaged in heavy infrastructure investment around the world for a good dozen years at that point – as had other countries.\nTo clarify and confuse things simultaneously, “belt” actually refers to land-based connections, and “road” to maritime ones. The plan ostensibly was aimed at re-inventing the old Silk Road in a 21st century paradigm. To that end BRI encompasses infrastructure in its broadest sense including communications, manufacturing capability, and industry development. At the core of it – for building roads, rail lines, ports, and just about anything else – is the need for energy.\nMost BRI projects are in under-developed countries in six of the seven continents (Antarctica being the exception) where mainstream financial institutions are reluctant to do business. Many China-watchers label BRI a geopolitical influence effort designed to make these nations beholden to China for, among other things, the loans they have to repay to Chinese financial institutions.\nExporting abroad China’s coal resources\nBut other China experts see things more in economic terms for China itself – now facing a slowdown. They say China is looking for markets for its resources – coal among them – and jobs for its own population.\nPutting those factors together with the genuine Chinese decarbonization effort at home and the result in some cases has been literally to transfer China’s oldest, dirtiest, and least efficient coal technology to its BRI partners and provide a workforce to go with it. Cambodia is one place that got a disassembled coal plant from China and had it re-assembled.\n“It’s the sort of elephant in the room,” says Lachlan Carey, associate fellow in the Energy and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “When we look at any measure of global emissions or any scenario of how we reach the Paris targets, it relies a whole lot on China’s transitioning away from its reliance on coal. So the Belt and Road, to the extent it has really significant impact on climate change and its trajectory – is the extent to which China is using it to export its capacity in the coal sector.”\nCarey says that China is also responding to market forces and that there’s no saying countries like Vietnam, where energy demand is growing at an astronomical rate, wouldn’t have built coal plants anyway.\nChina has been willing and able to help with that and do it quickly, he and others say.\nTurner at the Wilson Center points to Pakistan, where 33 percent of people still don’t have electricity. “You desperately need economic development; you need electricity to make that happen; and here comes China, baby,” she says. “The Chinese come in and say – ‘do you want it next week?’ It’s the wild West out there. But they [China] have the biggest hat and the biggest boots.”\nTurner: Through BRI, ‘China has ostensibly nullified their own goodness.’\nBecause there is no official list of what China is planning with Belt and Road, or even a clear picture of just what is under its umbrella, numbers can be a little hard to come by. But Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center has crunched numbers on China’s Global Energy Finance, separating out what is and is not – or at least seems to be – Belt and Road.\nReaching back nearly 20 years, that research shows about $245 billion in energy sector financing, more than $186 billion of it considered BRI. More than 75% of it, covering scores of projects, involves fossil fuels. The largest segment is coal, followed by oil and natural gas. There is also hydropower, but classic renewables are barely a blip.\n“China has ostensibly nullified their own goodness,” Turner says of that nation’s compliance with the Paris agreement.\nAnd in that nullification, China’s BRI has locked in fossil fuels and their climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions, not for years, but for decades.\nWide-ranging impacts, many ill- or not considered\nBut there’s more.\nWith a lot of BRI focused on transportation, energy concerns also extend to what’s required for construction. Then there’s what road building will mean for emissions – likely an increase. Rail is a major component, and efficient high-speed rail could help cut emissions. But there are concerns that older, inefficient train systems China no longer wants will find new life in BRI.\nHidden in plain sight throughout is one of the biggest energy users – cement, the key ingredient in the concrete used in nearly every aspect of construction. Beyond the energy intensiveness of its manufacture, likely to be coal-driven, it’s also disruptive to eco-systems that supply its sand and stone components.\nThen there’s the disruptive nature of the roads and rail lines themselves, and of the impacts of an influx of people as a result of the development of areas around improved existing and new travel corridors and specific projects. Those impacts cascade as infrastructure begets development, which begets more infrastructure.\nRichard Nash, technical lead, governance at the World Wildlife Foundation, points to a number of effects – most notably the pressures on water resources. Port development can disrupt coastal wetlands, whose eco-system and physical properties can help mitigate – and in some cases literally absorb – the effects of sea-level rise and warming temperatures.\nHe pointed to the Mekong River, where BRI development is exacerbating the drop in water table levels, potentially endangering drinking water, already under climate change pressure.\n“People are just pumping out of the ground. Pumping out of rivers. And they’re just becoming more depleted,” he says. “Aquifers are becoming disconnected from the streams that are feeding into them. It’s not been a very singular project. It’s the nature of development as a whole and the BRI is supporting that.”\nThe Duke/World Bank study and a larger one by the World Bank alone offer long lists of potential direct and indirect impacts as BRI scoops up areas or transects them in ways that could exacerbate existing climate change stresses.\nThe World Bank report, for instance, points out that high-speed rail requires straight lines that can’t be routed around topographical and hydrological barriers. The report states: “Related risks include landslides, flooding, soil erosion, sedimentation in rivers, and interruptions of water courses. For some portions of the BRI, at-risk populations are large, as in Myanmar, where 25 million inhabitants down-slope from two proposed BRI road projects are vulnerable to any increased sedimentation and induced flooding.”\nAmong other impacts cited – deforestation that can diminish carbon sequestration. There’s habitat loss and fragmentation that could further harm wildlife, for instance increased collisions with motor vehicles and inability to transect things like rail corridors.\nMany experts point to what happened in Kenya with a BRI plan for a rail line through Nairobi National Park. Activists delayed it for years and ultimately forced part of the line to be elevated so wildlife can cross underneath. A portion of it was scuttled, and objections to a coal plant caused its backer to pull out.\nA common complaint is that the Chinese have not done the kind of integrated strategic planning the BRI should have warranted.\n“The whole point is to figure all this out before individual projects are signed on to. It’s very easy to avoid sensitive habitat or a national park if you look at the map ahead of time,” says Losos of Duke. “Had they done an early plan, they could have avoided years of fighting and lots of money.”\nChina a leader on renewables … but irony of ironies\nAmong the ironies of the Chinese focus on coal and other fossil fuels as primary energy sources for Belt and Road is that China is a world leader in renewables. In addition to fulfilling its own renewable goals, it is the world powerhouse in particular in the production of components for solar power.\nBut solar has been conspicuously absent in Belt and Road. Building coal plants is easier and faster, observers point out. There is also a financial quirk in that the large traditional power plant companies tend to be state-owned enterprises while renewable companies tend to be private and a lot smaller, and therefore less under government control.\nLost opportunities for China to be the renewable good guys? Maybe.\nThe Chinese have gotten a certain amount of negative publicity for pushing BRI as a “green” program … and then not following through. At a BRI forum in April 2019, attendees say Xi redoubled his commitment to a green Belt and Road.\n“If you listen to the talk and if you read the guidelines that the Chinese have put out over the last few years – if they did half of the things they said, it would be the biggest environmental global initiative ever undertaken in the world,” Losos says. “A quarter of the things would be amazing, but there’s not much detail in these guidelines and they’re virtually all voluntary.”\nLosos and others, noting that China does not like getting bad press, broadly recommend a bit of psychology to convince officials in China they’ll be perceived as really bad actors if they don’t come around on environmental commitments.\nOne way to do that is to get China to follow its own tough climate standards in host countries even though the Chinese say they don’t interfere in local politics.\n“Until China changes that, the rest is largely lip service,” Carey of CSIS says, quoting a Chinese proverb from his own report: “The mountains are high and the emperor is far away.”\nOther reforms would be to get the financial and insurance institutions making the commitments to put environmental qualifications on them, insist on less secrecy, and disclose the carbon emissions of projects.\n“Our theory of change is that you need both the transformation of the supply of finance – that is to say how Chinese institutions are seeking to deploy their money – and also the change on the demand side – what is being demanded at the country level on the recipient side,” says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, global director of the Sustainable Finance Center at the World Resources Institute. That group works broadly to promote a shift of finance from unsustainable environment activities to sustainable ones. The WRI center has done its own working paper on BRI.\nMartinez-Diaz says if China’s goal in BRI of connecting that nation to the rest of the world just winds up locking-in environmentally destructive technology, it’s going to undermine the creation of more favorable political conditions for Chinese investment. “That’s why we are underlining a green BRI would be not only good for the world, it also would be good for China,” he says.\n“It’s going to be a lot easier for all of us, for civilization, to deal with climate change if we’re all pulling in the same direction,” says Daniel Bresette, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, noting that an absence of U.S. leadership has left the door wide open for China to make the rules. “I’m sure there are people in other parts of the world who say ‘great, that provides an opening for us.’ And that’s really unfortunate.”\nLosos at Duke says it’s important to remember that BRI consists of enormous projects with long-term investments, so integrated planning is everything. “Once you’ve invested and you have it and it’s working and people are employed and depending on it, it becomes a commitment,” she says. “The decisions made, we’re going to have to live with for decades.”\nEditor’s note: Want to learn more about this extraordinary Chinese global initiative?

   "paragraph": "Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change\nPosted on 2 March 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Robert McSweeney\nThe persistent march of a warming climate is seen across a multitude of continuous, incremental changes. CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Ocean heat content. Global sea level rise. Each creeps up year after year, fuelled by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\nAnd while climate records are being routinely broken, the cumulative impact of these changes could also cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically and irreversibly.\nThese “tipping points” are thresholds where a tiny change could push a system into a completely new state.\nTipping points\nThis article is part of a week-long special series on “tipping points”, where a changing climate could push parts of the Earth system into abrupt or irreversible change\nExplainer: Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change\nGuest post: Could the Atlantic Overturning Circulation ‘shut down’?\nGuest post: The irreversible emissions of a permafrost ‘tipping point’\nGuest post: Could climate change and deforestation spark Amazon ‘dieback’?\nGuest post: How close is the West Antarctic ice sheet to a ‘tipping point’?\nImagine a child pushing themselves from the top of a playground slide. There is a point beyond which it is too late for the child to stop themselves sliding down. Pass this threshold and the child continues inevitably towards a different state – at the bottom of the slide rather than the top.\nIn this article, Carbon Brief explores nine key tipping points across the Earth system, from collapsing ice sheets and thawing permafrost, to shifting monsoons and forest dieback.\nAlong with this explainer, Carbon Brief has published guest articles from experts in four of the tipping points covered here.\nTipping towers\nIrreversible change?\n1. Shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\n2. West Antarctic ice sheet disintegration\n3. Amazon rainforest dieback\n4. West African monsoon shift\n5. Permafrost and methane hydrates\n6. Coral reef die-off\n7. Indian monsoon shift\n8. Greenland ice sheet disintegration\n9. Boreal forest shift\nOther tipping points\nTipping towers\nA glance at the news media on any given week will likely highlight all sorts of climate change impacts. From declining Arctic sea ice and record-breaking heatwaves to melting glaciers and worsening droughts, the increase in global average temperature is being felt around the world.\nBroadly, these impacts reflect gradual changes caused by a climate that is steadily warming. Scientists have estimated, for example, that for every tonne of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, summer sea ice cover in the Arctic shrinks by three square metres.\nHowever, there are parts of the Earth system that have the potential to change abruptly in response to warming. These systems have “tipping points”, explains Prof Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. He tells Carbon Brief:\n“A climate tipping point, or any tipping point in any complex system, is where a small change makes a big difference and changes the state or the fate of a system.”\nSo, rather than a bit more warming causing slightly hotter heatwaves or more melting of glaciers, it causes a dramatic shift to an entire system.\nThat extra bit of warming would be, as the saying goes, the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Or, to use a more animal-friendly metaphor, a game of Jenga – where a particular component within the Earth system, such as an ice sheet, circulation pattern or ecosystem, is represented by the tower of blocks.\nAnimation by Tom Prater for Carbon Brief.\nThe gradual increase in global temperature sees block after block removed from the tower and placed on top. As time goes on, the tower becomes more and more misshapen and unstable. At some point, the tower can no longer support itself and it tips over.\nIn the game of Jenga, the tower collapses in a split second. For a component of the Earth system, the shift to one physical state to another may take many decades or centuries. But the feature they have in common is that once the collapse has started, it is virtually impossible to stop.\nIt is worth noting that a tipping point can be caused by natural fluctuations in the climate as well as by an external forcing, such as global warming. These are called “noise-induced” tipping points and include, for example, periods of abrupt change during the last ice age called “Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events”.\nNatural fluctuations can also be the final nudge for a tipping point pushed to the brink by human-caused climate change, says Prof Mat Collins, joint Met Office chair in climate change at the University of Exeter and coordinating lead author on the “Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks” chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”). He tells Carbon Brief:\n“As you approach the edge of the cliff, a small random gust of wind is more likely to blow you over the edge. This is more prevalent in biological systems. A strong marine heatwave in one year can wipe out a large coral ecosystem for many decades – or, perhaps, even permanently. The heatwave is a result of natural fluctuations, but becomes more likely and more extreme with an increasing average trend.”\nIrreversible change?\nThe theory of potentially abrupt changes in the Earth system is not new. In a Nature commentary in 1987, for example, Prof Wally Broecker of Columbia University – who died in 2019 – warned that palaeoclimate data suggests the “Earth’s climate does not respond to forcing in a smooth and gradual way. Rather, it responds in sharp jumps which involve large-scale reorganisation of Earth’s system”.\nThe term “tipping point” itself was popularised by journalist and author Malcolm Gladwell in his book of the same name, published in 2000. Gladwell describes tipping points as “the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point”, and explores examples throughout human society:\n“There was a tipping point for [declining] violent crime in New York in the early 1990s, and a tipping point for the reemergence of Hush Puppies, just as there is a tipping point for the introduction of any new technology.”\nIn the years since, the term has been used increasingly in scientific circles. However, this has not been without controversy. There are, for example, many different views on how the term should be defined and used, explains Collins:\n“There has been an intensive debate in the field of tipping points, abrupt change and irreversibility about the definitions of these terms. They range from the very mathematical to those which are intended to be understood by policymakers.”\nAccording to a 2009 paper on the use of the term “tipping points” in climate science and the media, a presentation (pdf) in 2005 by Dr James Hansen of Columbia University’s Earth Institute helped “initiate a tipping point trend in climate change communication that was quickly reflected in public debate”.\nIn Hansen’s talk – a tribute to scientist Prof Charles Keeling, given at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting – Hansen warned that “we are on the precipice of climate system tipping points beyond which there is no redemption”.\nBy its Fall Meeting of 2008, the AGU had an entire half-day session dedicated to climate tipping points. A Science briefing about the meeting declared that “tipping points, once considered too alarmist for proper scientific circles, have entered the climate change mainstream”.\nA year earlier, the IPCC had published its fourth assessment report (“AR4”, pdf). This was the first of its assessment reports to use the term “tipping point” – though the third assessment report (“TAR”, pdf) in 2001 had discussed “large-scale discontinuities” that have the “potential to trigger large-scale changes in Earth systems”. Indeed, speaking to a journalist at the time, chapter lead author Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber explained that “these are, more or less, tipping points”.\nAR4 adopted a definition of a tipping point based on a 2002 report led by Penn State scientist Prof Richard Alley for the US National Research Council. It states:\n“Technically, an abrupt climate change occurs when the climate system is forced to cross some threshold, triggering a transition to a new state at a rate determined by the climate system itself and faster than the cause.”\nThe IPCC’s definition in its fifth assessment report (“AR5”, pdf), published in 2013-14, gives more detail:\n“We define abrupt climate change as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems.”\nTypically, definitions for a tipping point fall into two categories, says Dr Ricarda Winkelmann, junior professor of climate system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). She explains to Carbon Brief:\n“One is simply that one vital part of the climate system shows some kind of threshold behaviour and that means that a small perturbation around that element can cause a huge qualitative change. And then there’s another definition that actually says there needs to be a positive feedback mechanism associated with the element. So that means there is something that’s self-reinforcing and then that could lead to irreversible changes as well.”\nPassing an irreversible tipping point would mean a system would not revert to its original state even if the forcing lessens or reverses, explains Dr Richard Wood, who leads the Climate, Cryosphere and Oceans group in the Met Office Hadley Centre. He tells Carbon Brief:\n“In some cases, there is evidence that once the system has jumped to a different state, then if you remove the climate forcing, the climate system doesn’t just jump back to the original state – it stays in its changed state for some considerable time, or possibly even permanently.”\nThis is known as “hysteresis”. It occurs when a system undergoes a “bifurcation” – which means to divide or fork into two branches – and it is subsequently difficult, if not impossible, for the system to revert to its previous state.\nFor example, part of the reason that Greenland has an ice sheet today is that it has had that ice sheet for hundreds of thousands of years. If the Greenland ice sheet were to pass a tipping point that led to its disintegration, simply reducing emissions and lowering global temperatures to pre-industrial levels would not bring it back again. It would probably require another ice age to achieve that.\nSimilarly, returning to the Jenga analogy, the amount of energy required to rebuild the tower once it collapsed is significantly greater than the energy used to tip it over.\nThe extent to which the tipping points considered in this article are irreversible is just one of the many uncertainties that researchers are still exploring. Nonetheless, each of the nine – explained below – are examples of where seemingly small changes have the collective potential to pack a potent punch.\nShutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean that brings warm water up to Europe from the tropics and beyond.\nThe illustration below shows the two main features of the AMOC: the first is the flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the ocean northwards from the Gulf of Mexico (red line). This is made up of the “Gulf Stream” to the south and the “North Atlantic Current” further north. The second is the cooling of water in the high latitudes of the Atlantic, which makes the water more dense. This denser water then sinks and returns southwards towards the equator at much deeper depths (blue line).\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Reprinted by permission from Springer. Praetorius (2018) North Atlantic circulation slows down, Nature.\nThe AMOC forms part of a wider network of global ocean circulation patterns that transports heat all around the world. It is “driven by deep water formation”, explains Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at Potsdam University and co-chair of earth system analysis at PIK. This is “the sinking of dense, therefore heavy, water in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic”, he explains to Carbon Brief.\nClimate change affects this process by diluting the salty sea water with freshwater and by warming it up, he says:\n“The dilution happens through increased rainfall and also melting of continental ice in the vicinity of mainly the Greenland ice sheet. And that makes the water lighter and, therefore, unable to sink – or at least less able to sink – which, basically, slows down that whole engine of the global overturning circulation.”\nRecent research suggests that the AMOC has already weakened by around 15% since the middle of the 20th century. This is in line with projections by climate models, says Dr Richard Wood. However, the question remains at what point a weakening tips over into a complete shutdown, he explains:\n“Perhaps a much less likely, but larger cause for concern is whether there’s a threshold beyond which the AMOC becomes unsustainable and at that point – if you pass that threshold – then over some period of time, the AMOC might reduce to zero or even potentially a reversed circulation. And that would have big impacts on the climate of, well, the whole northern hemisphere, but particularly Europe.”\nThis shutdown could happen because the AMOC is a self-reinforcing system, explains Rahmstorf:\n“The circulation itself brings salty water into the high-latitude Atlantic and the salty water increases the density. And so we can say the water is able to sink because it is salty and it is salty because there is this circulation. So it’s like a self-reinforcing system.”\nSuch a system can only be pushed “up to a limit”, says Rahmstorf, after which the self-reinforcing system actually works to further weaken the circulation. Too much freshwater in the North Atlantic slows the circulation, preventing it from pulling salty water up from the south. Thus, the North Atlantic freshens even more and the circulation weakens further – and so on. It “really is an on-off system”, he adds.\nThere is still a lot of uncertainty about where exactly this tipping point is, says Rahmstorf. To the extent that “nobody really knows”, he adds:\n“But, I would say, most people think that to trigger a real shutdown would require substantial global warming – like 3C or 4C [above pre-industrial levels]. And we could pretty well minimise this risk by limiting the warming to below 2C. So, if we actually take the Paris Agreement seriously, then I would feel relatively relaxed about the risk of a shutdown. But if we continue on the current path and heading for three or more degrees, then this becomes a really serious concern.”\n(According to Climate Action Tracker, current global climate policies put the world on track for around 3C of warming.)\nAnd it is “important to emphasise that climate models are not suggesting a complete shutdown of the AMOC in the next 100 years or so”, adds Wood: “We’re looking at what we call a ‘low-probability, high-impact’ event”.\nThe IPCC’s special report on 1.5C of warming, for example, concludes that while “it is very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century”, there is “no evidence indicating significantly different amplitudes of AMOC weakening for 1.5C versus 2C of global warming, or of a shutdown of the AMOC at these global temperature thresholds”.\nWere the AMOC to cross a tipping point, models suggest it would trigger a “quick decline that takes decades and then a kind of slower decline which might take even hundreds of years”, says Wood.\nThis would be “practically irreversible” on human timescales, notes Rahmstorf:\n“Depending on the exact nature of the stability of the circulation, it could be shutdown basically indefinitely for thousands of years into a new stable shutdown state. Or it could eventually recover – both things we observe in different models. But, on a timescale if you’re just interested in what happens in the next 200-300 years or so, that doesn’t actually make a difference because it does stay off then once it dies for quite a long time.”\nThis “shutdown” state is an example of hysteresis, explains Wood in the video below. It means that once you go over the tipping point, even if global warming is stopped or reversed, the AMOC does not necessarily switch back on again immediately.\nAs the AMOC plays a crucial role in bringing heat up from the tropics, a shutdown would cause “widespread cooling around the whole of the northern hemisphere, but particularly around western Europe and the east coast of North America”, says Wood. This could be in the order of “several degrees, possibly 5C”, he adds.\nThis cooling would have knock-on impacts for rainfall patterns as there would be less evaporation from the North Atlantic, says Wood. This could either offset or magnify the changes caused by global warming, he says:\n“In northern parts of Europe, we might expect from global warming to see wetter winters and then the drying would compensate. In other regions, more in southern Europe, where we would already be expected to see a drying signal from the global-warming signal, so paradoxically, the cooling would give you a further drying. So it would actually reinforce the climate-change signal.”\nThe knock-on impacts would be considerable. For example, a recent study in the new journal Nature Food suggests that an AMOC shutdown would cause “widespread cessation of arable farming” in the island of Great Britain with “losses of agricultural output that are an order of magnitude larger than the impacts of climate change without an AMOC collapse”.\nIn addition, there will be implications for the ocean itself, notes Rahmstorf:\n“The whole North Atlantic ecosystem is adapted to the existence of this overturning circulation, which really sets the conditions – the seasonal cycle, the temperature, the nutrient conditions – in the North Atlantic, and so the intricate web of the Atlantic ecosystem will be substantially disrupted if allow such a massive change in the ocean circulation to happen.”\nFinally, research suggests that the collapse of the AMOC could itself trigger other tipping points. As the SROCC explains:\n“For example, a collapse of the AMOC may induce causal interactions like changes in ENSO [El Niño–Southern Oscillation] characteristics, dieback of the Amazon rainforest and shrinking of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet due to seesaw effect, ITCZ [Intertropical Convergence Zone] southern migration and large warming of the Southern Ocean.”\nHowever, the SROCC notes that “such a worst-case scenario remains very poorly constrained” as a result of the large uncertainties around how systems such as AMOC will respond to warming.\nWest Antarctic ice sheet disintegration\nThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is one of three regions making up Antarctica. The other two are East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, with the Transantarctic Mountain range dividing east from west.\nAlthough much smaller than its neighbour to the east, the WAIS still holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by around 3.3 metres. Therefore, even a partial loss of its ice would be enough to change coastlines around the world dramatically.\nClick here to read the rest"

   "paragraph": "2020 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #9\nPosted on 29 February 2020 by John Hartz\nA chronological listing of news articles linked to on the Skeptical Science Facebook Page during the past week, i.e., Sun, Feb 23, 2020 through Sat, Feb 29, 2020\nEditor's Pick\nWant people to care about climate change? Skip the jargon.\nGrist\nIf you’re confused what the “circular economy” is, or what it means for a company to go “net-zero,” you’re far from alone. There’s a big mismatch between what scientists, journalists, and activists are saying and what the public understands. This is hardly a new problem, but it’s yet another obstacle to getting people to care about climate change: Obscure words in articles about rising sea levels and supercharged weather could discourage people from wanting to learn more about a planetary crisis.\nThe solution is to put jargon and buzzwords into simple language that anyone can understand. It takes some effort, of course. A good example is “Up Goer Five,” a diagram by Randall Monroe, the cartoonist behind the website xkcd. It explains how a rocket works using only the 1,000 most common words in the English language. Simplifying lingo related to climate change requires a similar process. Take a cold, clinical word like “biodiversity” and turn it into the more evocative “wildlife.” A real head-scratcher like “climate mitigation” becomes “reducing emissions.”\nForget “dumbing down.” Using more common language is “smartening up,” said Susan Joy Hassol, director of the nonprofit science outreach group Climate Communication in North Carolina, who coaches scientists and journalists to write and speak more conversationally. “The only thing that’s dumb,” Hassol said, “is speaking to people in language that they don’t understand.”\nWant people to care about climate change?

House Republicans plan to introduce legislation to plant 3.3 billion trees per year domestically over the next 30 years (an 800 million increase over the 2.5 billion per year that are already planted in the U.S.), as well as encouraging carbon capture and sequestration from power plants by providing research & development funding and creating a tax incentive for using the technology. This poses the question – how much impact would these carbon sequestration proposals (especially the tree planting initiative) have on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and global warming?\nBastin et al. (2019) sought to quantify the potential global tree restoration potential and the carbon sequestration associated with that reforestation and afforestation. The study concluded, “there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon [GtC] in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests.” For comparison, humans have emitted approximately 640 GtC, so this would represent a significant chunk of human emissions to date. 900 million hectares of land is approximately the size of the United States.\nHowever, several comments identified flaws in the Bastin et al. estimate. Friedlingstein et al. (2019) noted that their estimate of the potential carbon storage of trees in each biome did not account for the carbon already stored in those regions, and thus concluded:\nthe potential carbon storage would be substantially lower than reported … Moreover, forests affect climate through biophysical feedbacks, such as changes in albedo or evapotranspiration, which can counteract the cooling effect from CO2 uptake … These biophysical feedbacks were not discussed in the article and could substantially reduce the potential of forest reforestation in some of the considered regions.\nVeldman et al. (2019) in concluding that the true maximum tree carbon sequestration potential is closer to 42 GtC, noted:\nTheir analysis inflated soil organic carbon gains, failed to safeguard against warming from trees at high latitudes and elevations, and considered afforestation of savannas, grasslands, and shrublands to be restoration.\nLewis et al. (2019) noted that the carbon sequestration rate used by Bastin et al. (0.22 GtC per million hectares) was twice that in previously published estimates. Using a variety of methods to roughly approximate the global tree carbon sequestration potential, Lewis et al. estimated the value between 89 and 108 GtC. Moreover, Lewis et al. note:\n25% of the new tree cover [would be] in tundra and boreal regions, where warming from forests’ lower surface albedo can offset the cooling from new carbon uptake.\nLet’s examine the carbon sequestration and global warming mitigation potential of planting trees in all available areas outside of tundra and boreal regions, where as Lewis et al. note, replacing relatively reflective land surface with dark tree canopy would offset the cooling from carbon uptake. Using the above referenced studies, as an approximation, let’s estimate that doing so could sequester 75 GtC, once the nearly trillion trees have reached maturity.\nHumans currently release 10 GtC annually from fossil fuel combustion and other activities; therefore, continuing at current emissions rates would offset the carbon sequestration potential of this maximal tree restoration effort within 7 to 8 years. Thus it’s important to note that planting trees cannot replace the phasing out of fossil fuels, but it can complement it.\nUnder policies and commitments currently in place, global average surface temperatures are on a path for approximately 3°C in 2100 (though headed north of 4.5°C by the time a new equilibrium is reached, unless future policies bring emissions down to zero). This translates into approximately 1,650 GtC of human emissions between 2020 and 2100, or an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration around 620ppm in 2100. Removing 75 GtC through tree planting would lower that CO2 concentration to around 585 ppm (see this post for useful conversions). To translate these numbers into global surface temperature changes, we can use the following formula related to the radiative forcing of CO2:\nWhere the left side of the formula represents the global surface temperature change once a new equilibrium is reached, RF is the radiative forcing (in this case, from increased CO2), lambda is the climate sensitivity parameter (approximately 0.8), C is the atmospheric CO2 concentration, and Co is the initial CO2 concentration (280 ppm pre-industrial).\nAt equilibrium, the temperature change associated with 620 ppm CO2 is 3.4°C, and for 585 ppm is 3.15°C (this doesn’t account for non-CO2 greenhouse gases or other forcings). By 2100 when the climate system will not yet be in equilibrium, the CO2-caused temperature changes would be closer to 2°C and 1.85°C, respectively. In short, maximal tree planting would offset around 0.15°C warming by 2100 and a quarter degree Celsius at equilibrum.\nDomestically, the US emits about 5.3 Gt CO2 (1.4 GtC) per year. Planting another 24 billion trees (an additional 800 million per year over 30 years), at around 1,000 trees per hectare and 0.12 GtC sequestered per hectare, per Lewis et al. (2019), corresponds to about 5.3 GtC sequestered once those trees reach maturity. In short, the tree planting proposal would offset about 3–4 year’s worth of US carbon emissions at current rates. That’s a start, but only a start.\nIt’s worth noting that reforestation and afforestation occupy a number of high slots on the Project Drawdown list of top climate solutions, including #5 and #12. However, adding them all up accounts for just around 40 GtC. This is probably a more realistic number than our 75 GtC, since we can’t plant trees on every available hectare of land. Doing so would decrease agricultural production and thus increase food prices, for example. This highlights why Project Drawdown lists 100 different individual solutions.\nPlanting trees won't be enough to solve climate change unless they're Ents and do to our fossil fuel infrastructure what they did to Isengard in Lord of the Rings.\nThere is no climate change silver bullet; planting trees helps, but it’s just one piece of silver buckshot among the many solutions needed to avert a climate crisis.\nWith respect to the technological carbon capture and sequestration component of the House Republican plan, if a power plant were able to capture and permanently sequester all of its emitted carbon, it would produce nearly carbon-neutral power (with the exception of the extraction and transportation of the associated fuel, and energy associated with construction). But the technology would need widespread application, and methods of permanently sequestering large quantities of CO2 would be required. Determining whether subsidizing fossil fuel companies to install this technology would be an efficient use of resources and revenue would require economic analysis."

   "title": "Community choice aggregation: A brief introduction",
   "paragraph": "Community choice aggregation: A brief introduction\nPosted on 20 February 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Bruce Lieberman\nCARLSBAD, CA. – When it comes to paying the electric bill, most people don’t give it a second thought – it’s something that in effect is “baked in.”\nBut across California and several other states, local governments increasingly are thinking anew about how their residents get their power – with big potential implications for Americans’ impact on climate change.\nIn the San Diego area this fall, several cities have moved toward community choice aggregation (CCA) – an arrangement in which local governments take over the job of buying electricity for their residents. Many cities and counties that run CCAs hire third parties with expertise in navigating energy markets, but the overall goal is to offer residents cheaper rates and more choices for renewable sources of energy. Residents and businesses situated within the boundaries of a local jurisdiction that launches a CCA are automatically signed up in it – although they can opt out and stay as customers of their traditional utility.\nThe interest in the approach extends beyond California.\nSo far, most if not all CCAs still rely on traditional utilities to manage the transmission of power and the billing of customers.\nWhere is community choice aggregation allowed?\nAround the country, the formation of CCAs has been authorized in nine states: California, Illinois, Massachusetts (the first state to authorize CCAs in 1994), New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Virginia, according to the website of Lean Energy U.S. Another five states – Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and Oregon – are investigating CCAs.\nThe California effort offers a snapshot of how CCAs are gaining momentum and of potential challenges they face.\nIn California, the state legislature approved the creation of CCAs in 2002, and since then 19 have sprouted up around the state. The first CCA formed in Marin County in Northern California in 2010 with 8,000 customers.\nOver the past 12 months or so, San Diego County has seen several cities dive into discussions to form their own. The coastal community of Solana Beach was the first in San Diego County to form a CCA, which became official in June 2018. In another effort this year, known as the Clean Energy Alliance, Solana Beach and neighboring cities Carlsbad and Del Mar have joined forces, each passing resolutions and adopting a joint powers agreement. As cities join together, they can pool their residents into a larger customer base and negotiate better prices with power providers. The inland city of Santee and the San Diego County government are considering joining the Clean Energy Alliance.\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune has covered initiatives in the county for more than a year, and some in-depth reports offer great background on CCAs.\nHow much does it cost for consumers?\nOne big question about CCAs is whether they actually offer rates that are cheaper or at least equal to what traditional utilities offer. Energy consultants predict that customers on a basic plan under the Clean Energy Alliance will pay 2% less for electricity than they would as customers of San Diego Gas & Electric, the Union-Tribune has reported, and 50% of their electricity would come from renewable sources of energy. About 45% of the electricity that SDG&E offers its customers comes from renewable sources.\nHow do renewables fit in?\nIn 2017 the percentage of electricity offered by CCAs in California that was generated from renewable sources was between 37 and 100% – for an average of 52%, according to the Luskin Center for Innovation at the University of California at Los Angeles.\nState targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are driving much of this move toward renewable sources of electricity in California. In 10 years, the state aims to cut emissions to 40% below 1990 levels – and get 50% of its electricity overall from renewable sources.\nThe city of San Diego, which has set a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035, has been considering the formation of a CCA. In response, SDG&E is working on a plan to offer the city 100% of its energy needs from renewable sources by the same year.\nHow does community choice aggregation affect utilities?\nBig utilities have reason to worry that CCAs could crack their monopolies on the electricity market. The Luskin Center has forecast that investor-owned utilities in California will continue to lose market share as CCAs gain momentum. In 2010, they had 78% of the market, but by 2017 that had fallen to 70%.\nOne unresolved factor that could affect how fast CCAs grow in California is something called a power charge indifference adjustment. The PCIA is essentially an exit fee that customers of a newly created CCA must pay, according to a requirement of the state’s public utilities commission. These exit fees are intended to cover past investments in power plants and other infrastructure for which utilities have an ongoing cost burden. The fees are intended to ensure that the utilities will not be any worse off financially for losing customers to CCAs.\nThe state’s public utilities commission determines the size of the fee charged to CCA customers, and the amount of the exit fee is controversial. In the fall of 2018, the commission handed investor-owned utilities a victory, allowing them to recover costs for power plant investments dating back nearly two decades.\n“Specifically, the decision would allow utility-owned power plants built before 2002 to be included in PCIA calculations, as well as remove an existing 10-year cap on the inclusion of post-2002 costs,” the electricity market news website GTM (also known as Greentech Media) reported when the commission voted on the change in October of 2018.\nWhat happens next?\nAnother worry, held by Michael Picker, former president of the CPUC, is that the state could be headed toward another energy crisis akin to the one seen in the early 2000s as customers seek power from sources other than the state’s heavily regulated big utilities – Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric. “These are electricity markets,” Picker told the Desert Sun newspaper in 2018. “There’s no guarantee that everybody will be successful. There’s a lot of ways people can fail.”\nDespite worries over exit fees and the ability of CCAs to reliably deliver power, the momentum behind CCAs and other alternatives to investor-owned utilities appears to be gathering steam. In mid-October of this year, The Nation ran a guest editorial titled “Pulling the Plug on PG&E.” It was a kind of call to action for grassroots efforts around California and the rest of the country to find alternatives to private utility companies.\nThe piece ran as PG&E was cutting power to millions of Californians – a precaution, the utility argued, to try to prevent wildfires sparked by downed transmission lines during the state’s dry and windy fall season. As has been widely reported, however, wildfires up and down the state erupted during the second half of October, although overall they were less destructive than what Californians experienced in 2018.\nIn her editorial piece, Johanna Bozuwa, co-manager of the Climate and Energy Program at the Democracy Collaborative (a research institution focused on economic inequality), wrote that Californians are growing more skeptical that PG&E will be able to provide reliable power as climate change makes fire seasons more extreme.\nThat skepticism, she wrote, “is fueling serious momentum for an alternative to the investor-owned model, in California and around the nation: a new, community-controlled, publicly owned energy system grounded in renewable energy, democratic governance, and decentralization.”"

   "paragraph": "How deniers maintain the consensus gap\nPosted on 18 February 2020 by John Cook\nAn excerpt from the book Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change, released Feb 25. First posted here.\nA number of studies have quantified the level of scientific agreement on climate change. In 2009, a survey by Peter Doran found that 97.4% of publishing climate scientists agreed that humans were changing global temperature. In 2010, Bill Anderegg analyzed public statements about climate change. He found 97–98% agreement among the most actively publishing climate scientists that humans are causing global warming.\nIn 2013, I led a team of researchers analyzing 21 years of scientific papers about global warming. Among relevant climate papers, 97% affirmed the consensus. Three different studies all found overwhelming scientific agreement.\nThe scientific consensus has also been endorsed by many scientific organizations around the world, such as the American Geophysical Union, European Geosciences Union, Royal Meteorological Society, and Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The National Academies of Science from eighty countries have all affirmed human-caused global warming.\nDeniers argue that there’s no scientific consensus on climate change because thirty-one thousand science graduates signed a petition rejecting the consensus. This argument appeals to fake experts. The only requirement for the Petition Project is an undergraduate degree in any kind of science. Only 0.1% of the signatories are climate scientists. Asking for nonexpert opinion on a complex topic is like asking a computer scientist to perform heart surgery.\nThis argument also misleads by using the technique of magnified minority. More than 10 million people have earned a science degree since 1971. That means that only 0.3% of Americans with science degrees signed the petition.\nCiting thousands of dissenting nonexperts to cast doubt on consensus is an ageold technique, perfected by the tobacco industry in the 1970s.\nClimate deniers have been trying to cast doubt on the scientific consensus for decades. Why attack the consensus? Republican strategist Frank Luntz conducted market research and found that people’s opinions on climate policy depended on whether they thought experts disagreed about human-caused global warming. Luntz advised Republican politicians to cast doubt on the scientific consensus.\nDecades of misinformation have taken its toll. The public mistakenly think 67% of climate scientists agree on human-caused global warming. The chasm between public perception and the 97% consensus is known as the consensus gap.\nOver a decade after Luntz’s insight, social scientists began researching how people think about consensus. They identified that public perception of consensus is a “gateway belief.” Once people understand that there’s scientific consensus, they’re more likely to accept that climate change is happening and requires action. Social scientists recommended that scientists should communicate the overwhelming expert agreement on human-caused global warming to correct the misconception that scientists disagree.\nCommunicating the 97% consensus has begun to undo the damage of misinformation campaigns. Over the last 5 years, public awareness of the scientific consensus has steadily increased.\nThis has led to a new argument from the same deniers who have claimed there is no consensus: now they argue we shouldn’t talk about consensus. Deniers want to convince the public that experts not only disagree on climate change but also stop scientists from clearing up this misconception.\nThe case for human-caused global warming isn’t based on the 97% consensus; it’s based on scientific evidence. Nevertheless, the public often rely on expert opinion to guide their views on complicated topics like climate change. This is why deniers target expert agreement and why it’s important to communicate the 97% consensus among climate scientists.\nCranky Uncle vs. Climate Change uses cartoons, climate science, and critical thinking to make sense of climate denial and misinformation. Guided by psychological research into how to refute misinformation, the book embraces a creative approach, using cartoons and visual analogies to make the science engaging and accessible to readers. The book is written and drawn by John Cook, a former cartoonist who now researches climate communication at George Mason University. Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change will be published by Kensington Books on Feb 25. Sign up for latest Cranky Uncle news at crankyuncle.com."

   "paragraph": "Climate goes extreme!\nPosted on 13 February 2020 by John Cook\nAn excerpt from the book Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change, released Feb 25.\nEvery weather event is affected in some way by global warming, including the buildup of heat, more moisture in the atmosphere, and rising sea levels. A direct impact of the extra heat is more intense and frequent heatwaves.\nWarming also accelerates evaporation of water from the ground and water sources. As the ground dries out, drought intensifies and fire danger increases. Extra evaporation also puts more moisture into the atmosphere, and warmer air can hold more water vapor. Both these factors result in heavier downpours. The warmer oceans also provides additional energy for hurricanes, making them more intense.\nWeather is somewhat unpredictable, like rolling dice. Global warming increases the occurence and/or strength of many types of extreme weather. It’s like drawing extra dots on the dice, increasing the odds of a higher roll.\nPeople often ask: “Was a specific weather event caused by climate change?” That’s the wrong question. A more appropriate question is: “Are weather events being affected by climate change?” The answer is yes, global warming is increasing the occurence and/or strength of extreme weather. As NOAA climate scientist Deke Arndt says, \"weather throws the punches, but climate trains the boxer.\"\nHeatwaves are getting hotter, lasting longer, and happening more frequently. Globally, heatwaves are happening five times more often due to global warming.\nThe number of heatwaves is predicted to increase in the future. If we don’t reduce greenhouse gas emissions, heatwaves will become twelve times more likely by 2040. While heatwaves have happened in the past, they are becoming more likely under global warming. Climate scientist Marshall Shepherd (drawn below) explains the difference between climate and weather with the following analogy: \"Weather is your mood, and climate is your personality.\"\nDeniers try to distract from the increasing risk of heatwaves by arguing that they have happened in the past, so today’s heatwaves are not influenced by global warming.\nThis argument commits the fallacy of jumping to conclusions. It’s like arguing that humans were dying of cancer long before cigarettes were invented, so smoking doesn’t cause cancer. The science is sending us a clear message: Heatwaves have happened throughout history, but global warming is increasing the frequency of heatwaves now and that risk will increase further in the future.\nCranky Uncle vs. Climate Change uses cartoons, climate science, and critical thinking to make sense of climate denial and misinformation. Guided by psychological research into how to refute misinformation, the book embraces a creative approach, using cartoons and visual analogies to make the science engaging and accessible to readers. The book is written and drawn by John Cook, a former cartoonist who now researches climate communication at George Mason University. Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change will be published by Kensington Books on Feb 25.

   "title": "On climate misinformation and accountability",
   "paragraph": "On climate misinformation and accountability\nPosted on 10 February 2020 by dana1981, John Cook\nLately there has been a great deal of misinformation regarding the origins and purpose of Skeptical Science. As John Cook wrote nearly a decade ago, Skeptical Science is primarily a website that debunks climate misinformation with peer-reviewed science. Despite the ever-worsening impacts from climate change, with record after record being broken in our warming climate, misinformation casting doubt on climate science is rampant and showing no signs of going away. Sadly, a resource that shines disinfecting daylight on climate misinformation is needed more than ever.\nWhen we find ourselves frequently debunking myths from the same sources, we collect that information in our 'Misinformation by Source' database. There are several reasons why we created that particular database.\nFirst, because we at Skeptical Science simply love data. That's the backbone of our website. We love to gather it, analyze it, and organize it for easy reference. One of the strengths of our site is making our debunkings accessible in different ways for ease-of-use, such as our multi-level rebuttals, translations, short URLs for easy sharing, and organized in a fact-myth-fallacy format.\nSecond, for the sake of accountability. If an individual propagates a climate myth to the public via a setting like a blog or media interview or congressional testimony, it's useful to have a resource documenting if that individual has frequently promoted climate myths in the past. If so, that individual should be considered a relatively unreliable source of accurate climate science information.\nTo those who object to being included on the 'Misinformation by Source' database, the remedy is simple – stop purveying climate myths. Perhaps acknowledge the mistakes you made in communicating those myths. Take responsibility for your own actions.\nSome individuals have misrepresented the motivation behind the database. Roger Pielke Jr., for example, misrepresented comments by one of us (Dana Nuccitelli) to claim that,\n\"Skeptical Science openly admits to using their website to destroy an academic’s career and make [Judith Curry] “unhirable in academic ... I am amazed that some blogger without a PhD & never having worked in a university believes that he can decide who should be hired by universities\"\nAs Dana noted, that's not at all what he said, which is that Judith Curry's penchant for propagating climate myths, as documented on her 'Misinformation by Source' page, would make it difficult for academic institutions to hire her. After all, accurately informing and educating the public is a key goal of most academic institutions. Misinforming the public runs counter to their goals. It's Curry's own words that are the problem, not the Skeptical Science page that catalogs them. Moreover, volunteer-run Skeptical Science doesn't quite have the clout to decide who academic institutions hire even if we wanted to.\nFor example, claiming, \"There is no scientific basis for saying that warming hasn’t stopped,\" or that Arctic sea ice isn't endangered, or accusing scientific colleagues of \"hide the decline stuff,\" or disputing the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, would all likely give an academic institution pause when considering an applicant for a climate science position. Skeptical Science has simply created a database documenting and debunking those individuals' myths in one location.\nUltimately, complaints from misinformers about Skeptical Science refuting misinformation are an attempt to avoid accountability and consequences for their act of misinforming the public. Pro tip: if you don't want to be held accountable for spreading climate misinformation, don't do it. And don't complain that somebody has created a database documenting and debunking your frequent misinformation.\nTo learn more about Skeptical Science and what we do please check our Welcome Page, the blog series published for our 10th Birthday, and the Review of our activities during 2019."

   "title": "Why coal use must plummet this decade to keep global warming below 1.5C",
   "paragraph": "Why coal use must plummet this decade to keep global warming below 1.5C\nPosted on 10 February 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Simon Evans\nThe next 10 years are crucial for tackling climate change, with widespread recognition that CO2 emissions must fall 45% by 2030 to keep global warming below 1.5C.\nYet global emissions are expected to continue rising, despite the pledges made by every country of the world under the 2015 Paris Agreement. This ambition gap is getting larger over time.\nNew Carbon Brief analysis of scenarios gathered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other data, shows that the ambition gap is particularly large for coal. Emissions from coal fall by around four-fifths this decade on a 1.5C pathway, twice as fast as for oil or gas.\nMoreover, CO2 from burning coal must still be roughly halved over the next 10 years to keep warming “well-below 2C” at the lowest cost, the analysis shows.\nCarbon Brief’s animation, below, shows how coal, oil and gas emissions change in just one pathway to keeping warming below 1.5C. This article explains where the numbers come from and how they change if the world chooses other – or less ambitious – routes to limiting warming.\nRecord emissions\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global temperatures “well-below 2C” above pre-industrial levels and to “pursue efforts” to stay within 1.5C. But, as UNEP and others have repeatedly highlighted, there is a yawning gap between the actions countries are taking and what would be required to meet the Paris targets.\nAs the last decade came to a close in 2019, the world’s CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels had reached a record high, as the chart below shows (solid lines). Although coal is now the single largest contributor (black), emissions from oil (orange) and gas (blue) are rising fast.\nGlobal emissions from coal (black line), oil (orange) and gas (blue), in billions of tonnes of CO2, between 1959 and 2019 (solid lines). Expected emissions for each fuel during the 2020s (shaded) are shown with dotted lines, based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2019 “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS). Source: Global Carbon Project, IEA WEO2019 and Carbon Brief analysis. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nIf governments stick with their existing policies and pledges, then fossil-fuel emissions are expected to continue rising this decade, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The dotted lines in the chart above show how it expects those emissions to change by 2030.\nDecade of action\nIn an effort to raise global ambition, UN secretary-general António Guterres has called for the 2020s to be a “decade of action” towards goals on climate and sustainable development. He has given particular attention to coal, calling for an end to new coal-fired power stations after 2020.\nBefore the COP26 climate summit in November, countries are expected to raise the ambition of their Paris pledges (nationally determined contributions, NDCs). At COP25, they agreed on the “urgent need to address the [ambition] gap” as they update or recommunicate their NDCs this year.\nOf the various ways to measure this ambition gap, one increasingly common refrain is that CO2 emissions need to fall to 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, to stay below 1.5C. This is an average of 53 least-cost pathways to 1.5C, developed in integrated assessment models (IAMs), and included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on 1.5C (SR15).\nLess widely understood are the very uneven implications for coal, oil and gas. To stay below 1.5C, emissions from coal need to fall around twice as quickly in the 2020s as those from oil and gas, according to Carbon Brief analysis of all relevant pathways in the SR15 database.\nThe chart below shows one such pathway towards 1.5C, the “P1” scenario from SR15. In this scenario, coal emissions fall by four-fifths from 2019 to 2030 (79%, dashed black line) while oil (44%, orange) and gas (39%, blue) each drop by around two-fifths.\nGlobal emissions from coal (black line), oil (orange) and gas (blue), in billions of tonnes of CO2, between 1959 and 2019 (solid lines). The dotted lines in the shaded area show emissions from each fuel in the “P1” scenario, from the IPCC special report on 1.5C (SR15). Sources: Global Carbon Project, IPCC SR15 and Carbon Brief analysis. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nIt is difficult to visualise the challenge of cutting global coal emissions by four-fifths within 10 years. The amount of CO2 released by coal burning each year would need to fall from around 14bn tonnes (GtCO2) in 2019 to just 3GtCO2 in 2030, an annual reduction of 1GtCO2.\nTo put this in perspective, it would be equivalent to closing every coal-fired power station in the US in 2020, then doing the same again every year until 2030. The cumulative 11GtCO2 cut by 2030 is more than the estimated 10GtCO2 released by every coal plant in the world in 2019.\nAlthough these are very large numbers, it is worth noting that the US has already halved its emissions from coal power, which fell from around 2GtCO2 in 2010 to 1GtCO2 in 2019. Similar reductions have been made in the EU, in percentage terms, with a fall of one fifth in 2019 alone.\nDifferent paths\nThere are – at least in theory – many different routes to staying below 1.5C. The chart and animation above are based on just one pathway to 1.5C, the “P1” scenario from the IPCC SR15.\nOne reasonable question to ask is: does coal use fall by four-fifths this decade in all scenarios? Another question is: are there ways to stay below 1.5C that entail less extreme reductions in the use of the fuel?\nIn short, coal emissions fall extremely fast this decade in all pathways to 1.5C – and roughly twice as fast as emissions from oil and gas. There are several reasons why this should be the case.\nFirst, the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C is extremely small, equivalent to around eight years of current emissions. Coal is the single largest contributor to emissions today and it emits far more CO2 per unit of energy than oil or gas, so it must inevitably fall quickly to keep warming below 1.5C.\nSecond, the more rapid reductions in coal emissions in the least-cost pathways to 1.5C reflect the availability of economically attractive alternatives that can be deployed in IAMs – and in the real world – including wind, solar and other zero-carbon sources of electricity. Notably coal plants around the world are facing financial difficulties, with loss-making operations from Europe to China.\nThe chart below shows the range of emissions from coal (black wedge), oil (orange) and gas (blue) this decade, in SR15 scenarios that stay below 1.5C with “no or low overshoot”. This means pathways with at least a 33% chance of staying below 1.5C throughout this century and at least a 50% chance of keeping temperatures to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in 2100.\nGlobal emissions from coal (black line), oil (orange) and gas (blue), in billions of tonnes of CO2, between 2000 and 2019 (solid lines). Currently expected emissions for each fuel during the 2020s (shaded) are shown with dotted lines, based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2019 “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS). The coloured wedges show the range of emissions for each fuel in “no or low overshoot” 1.5C scenarios from SR15, filtered to exclude unsustainable use of bioenergy. Sources: Global Carbon Project, IEA WEO2019, IPCC SR15 and Carbon Brief analysis. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nNote that the chart excludes pathways reliant on higher levels of bioenergy or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) that are likely to be unsustainable, according to the IPCC special report on 1.5C.\nFor bioenergy, this was based on a limit of 100 exajoules (EJ) of primary energy in 2050, as set out in section 4.3.1.2 of the report. For BECCS, the limit was 5GtCO2 of annual CO2 removals in 2050, as discussed in section 4.3.7 of the report.\nIn the pathways to 1.5C shown in the chart above, coal emissions fall by 67-78% this decade (25th to 75th percentile range). In contrast, oil emissions in 2030 range from 4% to 38% below 2019 levels and gas emissions fall by 9-39% this decade.\n(If pathways using unsustainable levels of bioenergy are included in the analysis, then the models cut emissions from oil and gas slightly faster over the next decade. This could reflect the use of biofuels to replace petrol and diesel or biomass to replace gas heating, for example.)\nThe chart above suggests that the IAMs, when given a target to stay below 1.5C and given constraints on unsustainable use of bioenergy, see low-carbon alternatives to coal as more cost-effective and, therefore, more rapidly deployable than for oil and gas.\nBy implication, there may be an assumption entered into the models by their operators that, for example, electric vehicles (EVs) remain more costly than combustion-engine cars during the 2020s or that charging infrastructure is limited and that adoption rates are, therefore, low.\nAlternatively, the implication may be that even a relatively rapid rollout of EVs would initially have limited impact on emissions from oil. If in spite of the model scenarios, oil emissions end up being cut more quickly in the real world, then emissions from coal or gas could be cut more slowly, while still staying within a 1.5C budget.\nAlternatively, the shift towards SUVs and other factors could make it even harder to decarbonise oil use, meaning more effort is needed on coal and gas. The point is that staying within any particular carbon budget at lowest cost entails trade-offs, which the IAMs are designed to help us navigate.\nMore warming\nIf the 1.5C limit is breached, as many expect is likely, then it stands to reason that emissions from global coal use could fall more slowly than in the scenarios set out above. How much more slowly?\nThe main long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit warming to “well-below 2C”, an ill-defined target that is open to interpretation. One reasonable proxy is to look at the scenarios labelled “lower 2C” in the IPCC SR15 database, which was the basis for Carbon Brief’s analysis.\n“Lower 2C” pathways are those considered “unlikely” to breach 2C, meaning the probability is no more than 33% – and their average (median) peak warming this century is 1.7C. In contrast, “higher 2C” scenarios have no more than a 50% chance of exceeding 2C and an average (median) peak of 1.9C.\nIn “lower 2C” scenarios filtered to exclude unsustainable levels of bioenergy, coal emissions fall by 42-70% this decade (25th-75th percentile), as the chart below shows (black wedge). Again, this is far faster than for other fossil fuels, with oil emissions in 2030 ranging from 2% below to 13% above 2019 levels (orange) and gas between 9% below and 19% above 2019 (blue).\nGlobal emissions from coal (black line), oil (orange) and gas (blue), in billions of tonnes of CO2, between 2000 and 2019 (solid lines). Currently expected emissions for each fuel during the 2020s (shaded) are shown with dotted lines, based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2019 “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS). The coloured wedges show the range of emissions for each fuel in “lower 2C” scenarios from SR15, as a proxy for “well-below 2C”, and filtered to exclude unsustainable use of bioenergy. Sources: Global Carbon Project, IEA WEO2019, IPCC SR15 and Carbon Brief analysis. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nNotably, emissions from coal are expected to be far greater than the “well-below 2C” range, given current government policies and pledges. This points to a significant ambition gap that needs to be closed, if even the less ambitious Paris warming limit is to be respected.\nAlthough oil and gas emissions appear to be within the range of well-below 2C scenarios during the 2020s, they are currently expected to continue rising thereafter. Staying well-below 2C would require oil and gas emissions to start falling by the 2030s, as the chart below shows.\nGlobal emissions from coal (black line), oil (orange) and gas (blue), in billions of tonnes of CO2, between 2010 and 2019 (solid lines). Currently expected emissions for each fuel during the 2020s and 2030s (shaded) are shown with dotted lines, based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2019 “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS). The coloured wedges show the range of emissions for each fuel in “lower 2C” scenarios from SR15, as a proxy for “well-below 2C”, and filtered to exclude unsustainable use of bioenergy. Sources: Global Carbon Project, IEA WEO2019, IPCC SR15 and Carbon Brief analysis. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nThe analysis above breaks down the significant ambition gap between government policies and pledges, and the required cuts in emissions from each fossil fuel to keep global warming below 1.5C or well-below 2C.\nThis analysis shows that the ambition gap is particularly large for coal, given model assumptions around relative costs to mitigate emissions from each fuel and from each sector.\nWhether or not those assumptions are correct, the range of scenarios expose the choices ahead, trading off faster cuts in emissions from one fossil fuel or another, and between lower levels of warming or more extreme temperatures.\nEither action to tackle emissions from fossil-fuel burning must be rapidly stepped up, or the global community must accept warming beyond the levels deemed dangerous in the Paris Agreement – as adopted by consensus among more than 190 countries in 2015."

   "paragraph": "Earth is heating at a rate equivalent to five atomic bombs per second\nPosted on 6 February 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\nThe heat absorbed in Earth’s oceans reached a new record in 2019, found a recent study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. Despite the fact that this has been the case for almost every year over the past decade, this information dominated the news cycle, with some particularly viral headlines noting that the amount of energy accumulating in the oceans is equivalent to detonating five Hiroshima atomic bombs per second, every second over the past 25 years.\nWhile stunning, this isn’t a new analogy. After we published a paper about Earth’s energy accumulation in 2012, my colleagues and I at Skeptical Science created a website called 4Hiroshimas.com that provided a widget that websites can include on their homepages to illustrate the amount of heat accumulating on Earth as compared to the energy in the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The widget also uses other analogies to get the idea across, such as how the amount of heat accumulated compares to the energy in Hurricane Sandy, or 6.0 magnitude earthquakes, or Big Bens full of dynamite, or millions of lightning bolts. Improved ocean heat measurements have since revised the rate of warming upwards from four to five ‘Hiros’ per second. (For the record, as of the writing of this article, our climate has accumulated the equivalent of a total of more than 2.8 billion Hiroshima bombs’ worth of heat since 1998.)\nOur team wasn’t the first to use this analogy. In 2010, oceanographer John Lyman compared the rate of ocean warming to atomic bombs, and James Hansen used the Hiroshima atomic bomb analogy in his February 2012 TED talk. One might say that the comparison has come under heat, however. Some criticize the analogy for exploiting or being insensitive to the horrors suffered by the people of Hiroshima. Others have complained that the analogy is imperfect, as all analogies are, by definition.\nOn the other hand, the use of Hiros has one major upside. Earth and especially its oceans have been accumulating such a vast amount of heat due to human-caused global warming that it’s difficult to comprehend. Most people have little if any sense what 10 zettajoules per year—the amount of heat energy absorbed per year by the Earth—means. That’s why climate communicators have searched for a metric of comparison that the public can grasp. It’s relatively easy to visualize five atomic bombs detonating every second, and consequently comprehend the vast amount of energy being absorbed by the Earth’s climate system.\nFor those who nevertheless object to the Hiros analogy, perhaps microwaves offer a more palatable comparison. The heat accumulating in Earth’s oceans over the past 25 years is also equivalent to every person now on Earth running 35 standard household microwave ovens nonstop during Justin Bieber’s entire lifetime.\nCritically, the rate of global heating is also accelerating. During the prior 25 years (1968–1992), the oceans only warmed at a rate equivalent to one Hiroshima bomb detonation per second, or 7.7 billion people each running 10 microwaves nonstop during that quarter-century period.\nThe good news: the rate at which we’ve been adding heat to Earth’s climate hasn’t changed much over the past two decades. The bad news: to avoid a potential climate catastrophe, global heating needs to begin declining soon and rapidly, which will require international implementation of numerous ambitious climate policies.\nSo far, many governments appear more inclined to keep increasing fossil fuel extraction than taking the necessary steps to slow global heating. Political leaders in many countries can implement these destructive policies without fear of losing power because too few people grasp the urgency of the climate crisis. Perhaps visualizing global heating as five atomic bomb detonations per second will help convey that sense of urgency to more people."

   "paragraph": "Why is the Keeling curve so curvy?\nPosted on 4 February 2020 by John Cook\nAn excerpt from the book Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change, released Feb 25.\nIn 1958, Charles Keeling began measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. He found CO2 rising and falling from year to year. This graph became known as the Keeling Curve.\nThis yearly cycle is due to CO2 moving between the atmosphere and vegetation. In spring, plants convert CO2 into foliage. In autumn, the leaves fall and rot, emitting CO2 into the atmosphere.\nKeeling also found that over time, the amount of CO2 in the air was increasing. All our fossil fuel burning is causing a rise in atmospheric CO2.\nOver thousands of years, atmospheric CO2 levels remained relatively steady. Nature was in balance, with natural emissions equal to natural absorptions. Humans upset the balance during the Industrial Revolution, when we began burning fossil fuels. This sent large amounts of CO2 trapped underground as coal, oil, or gas into the atmosphere. Now atmospheric CO2 has increased to levels not seen in millions of years.\nDeniers try to minimize our role in disrupting the carbon cycle through a crafty piece of cherry picking. They argue that human emissions are small compared to natural emissions. For example, humans are emitting around 33 billion metric tons of carbon into the air every year, while nature is emitting around 740 billion metric tons of carbon.\nThis argument ignores that natural emissions are balanced by natural absorptions. Each year, nature emits approximately 726 billion metric tons of CO2 but also absorbs close to the same amount.\nBy failing to consider the full picture, this cherry pick distracts from the fact that human CO2 emissions have upset the natural balance. It’s like boasting about your gambling wins while ignoring your losses.\nCranky Uncle vs. Climate Change uses cartoons, climate science, and critical thinking to make sense of climate denial and misinformation. Guided by psychological research into how to refute misinformation, the book embraces a creative approach, using cartoons and visual analogies to make the science engaging and accessible to readers. The book is written and drawn by John Cook, a former cartoonist who now researches climate communication at George Mason University.

   "paragraph": "Startups aim to pay farmers to bury carbon pollution in soil\nPosted on 3 February 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Sarah Wesseler\nAs one result of modern farming practices that strip organic matter from the ground, between 20 and 60% of the carbon once stored in the world’s agricultural soils has been lost. Putting it back – a process known as carbon farming or regenerative agriculture – has been hailed as a promising climate mitigation solution.\nAccording to Rattan Lal, PhD, a leading expert on soil carbon, agricultural land could capture the equivalent of around 20% of annual global emissions. But Lal stresses that the benefits of carbon-rich soil go beyond climate – it’s also vital for food security, water quality, and biodiversity. Failure to replenish soil carbon is not an option, he said. “It’s not either/or. It’s a must.”\nHe believes that paying farmers to sequester carbon – specifically, about $16 per acre per year – is an important part of the solution. Some payment programs have been tried in the past, he said, but they haven’t been effective enough. “I do not think there is a real payment-of-ecosystem-services program anywhere in the world.”\nSoil as a bank\nLal uses a personal finance analogy to explain soil carbon management. “In your bank account, you want your total asset to increase,” he said. “Soil carbon is exactly the same way. If you put more carbon in soil than you take out, the soil carbon stock will go up and help give you more interest and more other benefits. But if you take out more than you put in, it will go down.”\n“Right now, the way the farmers are doing things, we are taking out more than what we put in.”\nThe causes of carbon loss are well understood, according to Lal. One is erosion from wind and rain. Another is the starvation of soil microorganisms, resulting from a lack of food sources like crop residue and root biomass. Soil disturbance (through tilling or bulldozing, for example) is problematic, as is leaching (in humid climates).\nThese losses can be minimized through a set of practices known as conservation agriculture, which emphasizes minimizing soil disturbance, keeping the soil covered, and rotating crops. But only about 8% of cropland is farmed this way, Lal said.\nThe problem isn’t that farmers don’t understand soil carbon, he believes. “Farmers are not stupid. I think they are very wise. They are wiser than the scientists, because they have to make their living out of this system.”\nInstead, the issue is money. If farmers can earn more by selling their crop residue for hay or other uses than by leaving it on their fields, many will, he said. “And simply by me or you going in and telling them ‘Don’t you dare do that!’ will just make them laugh and tell you, ‘Get lost,'” he said. “And that is exactly what we are doing.”\nCarbon storage payments\nProposals to make carbon sequestration financially attractive to farmers are becoming more common. Over the past few months, Democratic presidential hopefuls including Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders have pledged to pay for carbon farming if elected. Former candidate Cory Booker introduced a Senate climate change bill that would increase funding for a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that provides financial assistance to growers who adopt sustainable practices.\nAt the state level, California’s Healthy Soils Program Incentives Program currently offers grants to help producers store carbon. In Montana, conservation-focused nonprofit Western Sustainability Exchange runs a carbon payment program for ranchers.\nStartups are also getting into the game, betting that private-sector companies can help pay farmers by selling carbon offsets.\nOne trillion tons?\nLast summer, Boston-based Indigo Agriculture made headlines in business media with the announcement of its Terraton Initiative, which aims to pay growers to sequester one trillion tons of carbon dioxide.\nAlthough Indigo is involved in a range of farm-related activities, from microbial seed treatments to agronomy (expert farm consulting, essentially) and crop transportation, soil carbon is a major focus. The company has promised that farmers who signed up for its carbon program before the end of 2019 will receive at least $15 per metric ton sequestered. Payments will be financed partly through the sale of offsets, which go for $20 per ton. As of late January, growers had committed more than 17 million acres to the program, according to Indigo’s website.\nEd Smith, who leads the company’s carbon program, says that recent technological advances and increased public demand for climate solutions will help the Terraton Initiative succeed where others have failed. “We think now is the moment. We think now is different,” he said. Improvements in satellite technology allow Indigo to monitor farming practices like cover crop usage and tillage from afar, while distributed ledger technology enables secure public information-sharing for carbon credits.\nTechnology is also helping Indigo reduce the high cost of soil carbon measurement. “Measurement has basically killed the economics of projects in the past,” Smith said. To avoid the need for resource-intensive testing at every site, Indigo is gathering data from selected fields, then using it to calibrate a digital model that helps predict carbon sequestration rates in other locations.\nTo help bolster the accuracy and credibility of soil carbon measurement, Indigo has also formed partnerships with two carbon standards bodies, Verra and Climate Action Reserve.\nIncentives and barriers\nAnother startup that wants to pay growers for carbon farming is Seattle-based Nori. Its recently launched online marketplace connects people who want to fund sequestration to those who can provide the service – farmers, for example. According to the company, a recent pre-sale moved enough carbon credits to pay Maryland farmer Trey Hill more than $80,000, enough to capture 5,340 metric tons.\nWhile individuals can use the marketplace to offset their own emissions, large companies that work with growers have also expressed interest in Nori’s model, said Chief Development Officer Christophe Jospe. “They have frustration internally. They say, ‘We know what needs to be done. We know the best practices and we know how to help our farmers. We just need a system that they can plug into so that we can reward the farmers for the best practices.'”\nBut Jospe cautioned that the agricultural sector is complex, and that ecosystem service payments are only one piece of the solution. Powerful economic, political, and social forces steer many U.S. farmers toward practices that emit carbon rather than capture it. Crop insurance is weighted toward large-scale commodity production, and trusted salespeople tout the benefits of business-as-usual seeds, fertilizers, and equipment. Consolidation destroys midsize farms. Social pressures can discourage “doing weird farming,” as Jospe put it.\nMany farmers are also justifiably wary of outsiders, Jospe said, having been hurt in the past by policy and business decisions over which they had little say. “I think there’s a lack of trust that farmers have that is well deserved, because they’ve been found on the short end of the stick time and time again,” he said.\nOn the other hand, financial self-interest could help attract more farmers to regenerative agriculture. Many growers who have adopted these practices say that their profits have increased over time. According to Jospe, some of those who are now most active in carbon circles moved away from conventional agriculture simply because the chemicals it requires became too expensive. “A lot of the farmers have basically said, ‘Well, I can’t survive in this way anymore. Where can I reduce my fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides?’, and have found that those practices correlate really nicely with improving soil health. And that increases soil carbon,” he said.\nBut regenerative agriculture is still a niche practice. To help as many growers as possible understand how soil carbon sequestration can help them, Nori works with groups that have strong relationships within the agricultural community: The Nature Conservancy and farm software Granular, for instance, as well as agronomists.\n“Farming moves at the speed of trust,” Jospe said. “So we’re not necessarily trying to get this right by being a group that sits down at every individual table – rather, let’s just plug into the networks where the relationships already exist.”\nAUTHOR\nSarah Wesseler is a Brooklyn-based writer focusing on cities, culture, and climate change."

It depicted a landscape of power plants belching smoke, in the foreground of which was a billboard where an enthusiastic woman in a sunhat sipped a margarita through a straw. A speech bubble came from the woman’s lipsticked mouth: “Global warming?” she gushed. “I can’t wait!”\nIt was supposed to be a joke.\nMemory of that cartoon provoked an old, nihilistic laugh to echo in my throat at a confluence of climate events this week, 20 careless years later. Dear world, three months after they began, the Australian fires are not out. Today, ash is raining in our nation’s capital, orange flames stare over the mountains behind Canberra. Scientific consensus, affirmed by Australia’s exhausted fire chiefs, is that the fires are effects of the anthropogenic climate crisis. And yet even as the fires roar at the physical gates of power, on Sunday the conservative columnist Andrew Bolt, of the Murdoch press, published an insistence that climate change is “overall, a good thing”.

Fine balance, tipping point etc. Risk, danger concept or metaphor. by Sarah2, Shutterstock\nAt this point, the targets enshrined in the Paris climate agreement — holding the rise in global average temperature to a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to limit to 1.5°C — are beyond the reach of incrementalism. If the world’s large economies had begun a slow, steady reduction in greenhouse gas emissions back in the 1990s, it might have sufficed. But action has been delayed so long now that only rapid, radical change can still do the job.\nAs I wrote in a somewhat gloomy post earlier this month, the world is not exactly filled with happy signs and portents these days. The chances of sudden, coordinated change in a positive direction seem ... slim.\nIf there is any hope at all, it lies in the fact that social change is often nonlinear. Just as climate scientists warn of tipping points in biophysical systems, social scientists describe tipping points in social systems. Pressure can build beneath the surface over time, creating hairline fractures, until a precipitating incident triggers cascading changes that lead, often irreversibly, to a new steady state. (Think of the straw that broke the camel’s back.) It is less a matter of simple cause and effect than of emergent network effects that are unpredictable and somewhat mysterious even in retrospect.\nSocial tipping points are the only hope for the climate by David Roberts, Energy & Environment, Vox, Jan 29, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article as originally posted on the Vox website.\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\nSun, Jan 26, 2020\nIt’s Steven Mnuchin who should listen to economists on climate change by Matthew Yglesias, Vox, Jan 23, 2020\nBooming Plastics Industry Faces Backlash as Data About Environmental Harm Grows by James Bruggers, Inside Climate News, Jan 24, 2020\nThese scientists think we're in a 'bushfire spiral'.

   "paragraph": "Next self-paced run of Denial101x starts on February 4\nPosted on 31 January 2020 by BaerbelW\nThe next iteration of our free online course, Making Sense of Climate Science Denial, starts on February 4 and it will be the 13th run since the very first one in April 2015. Since then, more than 40,000 students from over 180 countries have registered for our MOOC which has been running either as a 7 weeks long paced or a longer running self-paced version like the upcoming one. The next run will be our longest self-paced run thus far and will stay open until December 16 2020, giving you ample time to work through the material at your own pace.\nOur MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is a collaboration between Skeptical Science and The University of Queensland and takes an interdisciplinary look at climate science denial. We explain the psychological drivers of denial, debunk many of the most common myths about climate change and explore the scientific research into how to respond to climate misinformation. With all the misinformation and outright lies coming out of Washington regarding climate science - not to mention many other topics in this age of fake news - our MOOC will give you the knowledge to spot and the tools to effectively counter them.\nA poster about Denial101x has been presented at various conferences and you can glean at least a rough idea about our MOOC's content from it (click the image for a larger version or download the poster as a PDF-file, but with 26MB it's fairly large):\nWe've received some wonderful feedback from students who've taken the course, particularly teachers who are using our course videos in their classes. Pat Bowden wrote a neat review about Denial101x for her blog in November 2017 and Corinne Esteryn spent a lot of time and effort to create very detailed course notes. Corinne also shared this feedback about Denial101x with us when she took it:\n\"This was the 1st MOOC I ever took and though I took many since, it remains my favorite. So many valuable information, from so many field experts, from all around the world, so much editing work in the videos, to make them as short as possible, yet packed with all the essential & accessible information. So many references. Such an outstanding amount of work, dedication, and all quite methodic and serious. Thank you to all the team for this great experience and all the knowledge shared!\"\nHere is a video compilation of some feedback from students:\nYou can sign up for free via the edX website.\nHope to see you there!"

   "paragraph": "Global warming is happening here and now\nPosted on 28 January 2020 by John Cook\nAn excerpt from the book Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change, released Feb 25.\nSigns of global warming are being observed all over our planet. Thermometers measure surface warming. Buoys sunk to ocean depths measure heat building up in our oceans. Ice is melting across our planet, with ice sheets crumbling and glaciers retreating. Spring is coming earlier. Sea levels are rising. Species are migrating to flee warming temperatures. Even tree lines are shifting!\nOver the last century and a half, our planet has warmed around 1°C. This involves a huge amount of heat, with negative impacts all over our planet. But locally, we experience tens of degrees of temperature change every day, so one degree doesn’t seem like much. Like frogs in a pot slowly coming to a boil, we find the severity of global warming difficult to grasp.\nThe notion that global warming is some far-off, distant threat is an insidious but prevalent misconception. It arises in part from the way we maintain psychological distance from our fears. We think of something as psychologically distant if we’re not directly experiencing it.\nPsychological distance manifests in different forms—thinking that global warming is happening in the distant future, that it’s happening in far-off places (this misconception perpetuated by clichéd images such as polar bears), that climate impacts are hypothetical and uncertain, and that the impacts are happening to communities different from us.\nIn reality, global warming is already happening and affecting all parts of society, in every corner of the world. As President Obama often reminded us, global warming is happening here and now.\nCranky Uncle vs. Climate Change uses cartoons, climate science, and critical thinking to make sense of climate denial and misinformation. Guided by psychological research into how to refute misinformation, the book embraces a creative approach, using cartoons and visual analogies to make the science engaging and accessible to readers. The book is written and drawn by John Cook, a former cartoonist who now researches climate communication at George Mason University. Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change will be published by Kensington Books on Feb 25.

   "title": "With the En-ROADS climate simulator, you can build your own solutions to global warming",
   "paragraph": "With the En-ROADS climate simulator, you can build your own solutions to global warming\nPosted on 27 January 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nKiller hurricanes, devastating wildfires, melting glaciers, and sunny-day flooding in more and more coastal areas around the world have birthed a fatalistic view cleverly dubbed by Mary Annaïse Heglar of the Natural Resources Defense Council as “de-nihilism“. One manifestation: An increasing number of people appear to have grown doubtful about the possibility of staving-off climate disaster. However, a new interactive tool from a climate think tank and MIT shows that humanity could still meet the goals of the Paris accord and limit global warming.\nBy itself, a carbon tax rising to around $200 per ton of emissions would bring the world about halfway to the Paris goal, according to the En-ROADS interactive tool developed by the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Climate Interactive think tank. Countries would also need to implement other aggressive climate policies targeting the many different sectors of the economy that generate large-scale greenhouse gas emissions. The tool allows a user to figure out how:\n– civilization must change the fuel mix supplying the world’s energy and boost efficiency;\n– the extent to which more buildings and vehicles must be electrified;\n– strategies could help reduce deforestation and how to plant more trees of the optimum species at the right locations; and\n– carbon capture technology could be relied upon to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\nCarbon taxes seen as the most effective tool\nAccording to Climate Interactive’s climate and energy lead, Ellie Johnston, “Behind En-ROADS is a system dynamics model that weaves the interdependencies and feedbacks of our global climate system with the actions that we need to take globally to address climate change.”\nThe simulation begins with a default business-as-usual scenario leading to 4.1 degrees Celsius (7.3 degrees Fahrenheit) global warming above pre-industrial temperatures by the year 2100. This outcome is essentially a worst-case scenario, assuming that current worldwide climate policies and pledges (which would limit warming to approximately 3 degrees C, or 5.4 degrees F) are not successfully implemented. For context, the international Paris agreement set a target of no more than 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) global warming, whereas 3 to 4 degree C warming would likely result in disastrous climate change consequences.\nIn the En-ROADS simulator, taxing carbon pollution is the single most effective way to bridge the gap between business-as-usual warming and the Paris target. A strong global carbon tax that eventually rises to around $200 per ton of carbon dioxide would reduce global warming from 4 to approximately 3 degrees C by 2100, erasing half of the difference between the two scenarios. The carbon tax makes already-expensive coal even costlier, accelerating its replacement by renewables, and also increases consumer demand for more energy-efficient products that become comparatively cheap as fossil fuel energy prices rise. According to a recent International Monetary Fund report, a carbon tax of $75 per ton would more than triple the price of coal and increase natural gas prices by 70%, with gasoline prices rising by about 70 cents per gallon.\nA growing body of climate economics research supports a robust carbon tax. For example, an October 2019 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences focusing on risk and uncertainty concluded that the appropriate carbon tax is more than $100 per ton of carbon dioxide, most economically efficient if immediately implemented at that high price. As co-author Gernot Wagner at New York University described their results, “taking risk and uncertainty seriously – and applying standard tools from financial economics – dramatically increases today’s carbon prices. It also reverses carbon price paths over time: high today, declining over time.”\nExperts for some time have debated the best way to structure a carbon tax. Some argue that the price should start low and increase over time in order to give consumers a period to adjust, thus making the tax more politically palatable. The new PNAS study argues that from a risk management perspective, the carbon tax should start high because emissions will then fall quickly, reducing the risk of catastrophic outcomes. As Wagner put it, “folks in 2300 will know more about the climate in 2300 than we know today. Uncertainty resolves itself over time.” In the meantime, the reasoning follows, prudent risk management requires taking aggressive steps to avoid a possible climate catastrophe.\nHowever, there are limits to how effectively carbon taxes alone can cut emissions. An assessment by scientists at Columbia University and the Rhodium Group of a specific carbon tax bill introduced to Congress – the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act – found that its rising carbon price would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 37% below 2005 levels by 2030. That result would more than double the 16% that American emissions are anticipated to fall during that same period under current policies. However, the analysis found that the bulk of these emissions reductions would come from the electricity sector, while carbon pollution from other sectors like transportation would remain relatively high. For example, the resulting increase in gasoline prices by around $1 per gallon on its own would be insufficient to dramatically reduce American vehicular fuel consumption.\nComplementary policies are needed\nSimilarly, the En-ROADS model also shows that a carbon tax alone would dramatically reduce the share of energy generated by coal, leading to continued high emissions as a result of more oil and gas production.\nOil consumption can be reduced in the En-ROADS model by strengthening vehicle fuel efficiency and electrification policies. In the real world, this approach translates to policies like vehicle fuel economy standards, which can mandate increased efficiency and thus accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. Projects to improve and electrify public transportation systems can also reduce demand for oil. Natural gas consumption can similarly be reduced by expanding energy efficiency and electrification of buildings and industrial activities. Together, the En-ROADS model suggests that these steps could curb global warming by one-half a degree Celsius.\nSlowing deforestation, planting more trees, and cutting emissions of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases like methane could cut another 0.5 degrees C or more off global warming by 2100. Combined with a carbon tax, these policies could achieve the Paris climate targets, if implemented globally. However, the En-ROADS tool illustrates just how difficult it will be to meet those goals, and how many different large-scale policies must be implemented to do so.\nMeeting the Paris targets would require that countries around the world soon begin implementing aggressive climate policies targeting the many different sectors of the economy that generate large-scale greenhouse gas emissions. Pricing carbon pollution is one of the single most effective steps to curb emissions, but achieving the Paris goals will require additional complementary policies."

That’s equivalent to adding 2.6 million cars to the road annually.\nNo industrial facility in the United States reported emissions of that magnitude between 2011 and 2018, according to an E&E News review of EPA data. In 2018, only 13 coal plants emitted more.\nSunshine is at the forefront of an often-overlooked boom in America’s petrochemical sector, one that climate advocates worry could undo recent greenhouse gas reductions by locking in a new source of planet-warming pollution for decades to come.\nPlastics Plants Are Poised to Be the Next Big Carbon Superpolluters by Benjamin Storrow, E&E News/Scientific American, Jan 24, 2020\nClick here to access the entire article as posted on the Scientific American website.\nPerspective of the Week...\nWe can’t recall the planet if we mess up: Climate change is risky business\nA man stands in a flooded street in Miami on Sept. 10, 2017, as Hurricane Irma hits the area.

But that’s not how we as a society are responding — even though the potential consequences are a lot worse than most business risks.\nConsider how climate change risk is expressed in key reports like those from the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA) and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe NCA says there is at least a two-thirds chance that your asthma or hay fever will get worse because of climate change. There’s a more than 90 percent probability that extreme precipitation (think flooding) will increase in frequency and intensity. What about heat waves increasing? There’s a 99 percent probability. In fact, heat waves kill more people than any other weather-related event in the United States.\nWe can’t recall the planet if we mess up: Climate change is risky business, Perspective by Rob Motta & Jim White, Capital Weather Gang, Washington Post, Jan 25, 2020\nToon of the Week...\nVideo of the Week...\nThe cause of Australia’s bushfires – what the SCIENCE says by Potholer 54, YouTube Video, Jan 18, 2020\nComing Soon on SkS...\nWith the En-ROADS climate simulator, you can build your own solutions to global warming (Dana)\nGlobal warming is happening here and now (John Cook)\nSkeptical Science New Research for Week #4, 2020 by Doug Bostrom\nToo late to stop Climate Change?

   "paragraph": "2020 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #4\nPosted on 25 January 2020 by John Hartz\nA chronological listing of news articles linked to on the Skeptical Science Facebook Page during the past week, i.e., Sun, Jan 19, 2020 through Sat, Jan 25, 2020\nEditor's Pick\nThe companies that have contributed most to climate change\nThought-provoking readings on those most responsible for the pollution.\nSometimes, in our struggle to address climate change, we need to see ourselves as facing not an incredibly complex (or “wicked”) problem (and one to which most of us contribute) but a clear-cut adversary. The world’s biggest fossil fuel companies inevitably make good candidates for that role, partly because they have done so much to delay political action, but also because they are literally the biggest source of the problem.\nTo learn more, an excellent place to begin is with a recent series from The Guardian. Starting on October 9, 2019, that paper published a significant cluster of stories in conjunction with the Climate Accountability Institute. The lead story is “Revealed: The 20 Firms behind a Third of All Carbon Emissions“; here is the first of three pages of links to the complete series (and a few later pieces).\nStill, even identifying a clearly responsible party to blame might not make the climate problem look tractable: Getting off fossil fuels is a truly daunting challenge. Chris Turner’s essay “We’re Doomed. Now What?: An Optimist’s Guide to the Climate Crisis” (The Walrus, November 2019) is more about its subtitle than its title. This thoughtful and thought-provoking look at some realistic but encouraging practicalities of converting the energy system makes a stimulating counterpart to the Guardian series. These stories update the 2017 Carbon Majors Report about the 100 most-carbon-polluting companies.\nAn important element in getting the world off fossil fuels involves how best to address the attendant, and fully understandable, concerns of all those who have been involved in the carbon economy, through employment or investments – including through retirement funds and pensions.

   "paragraph": "How did climate change get so controversial?\nPosted on 21 January 2020 by John Cook\nAn excerpt from the book Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change, released Feb 25.\nOur human brain is poorly equipped to deal with a threat like climate change. Over millions of years, we’ve evolved to avoid life-threatening dangers like predators jumping out of bushes. We’ve survived by quickly detecting and avoiding immediate, short-term dangers.\nIn contrast, global warming is a slow-motion disaster happening on a global scale. Our brains aren’t built to respond to planetary crises stretched out over a lifetime. It should come as no surprise that people have trouble appreciating just how dangerous climate change is.\nOn top of all these difficulties, we are also being hit with a massive wave of misinformation about climate change. Vested interests, political polarization, the global nature of climate change, and misinformation combine to form a perfect psychological storm, preventing people from accepting climate science and supporting climate action.\nFrom the public’s point of view, the tsunami of misinformation looks like scientific controversy. We hear experts and contrarians on TV or social media spouting jargon and assume scientists are still undecided on basic questions, like whether humans are causing global warming.\nThis veneer of controversy conceals the fact that our scientific understanding of human-caused global warming is built on more than a century of research. Scientific confidence is strongest when many different lines of evidence all point to a single conclusion. That’s what we observe with climate change.\nUnique patterns matching human-caused global warming—otherwise known as human fingerprints—have been observed all over our climate. This body of evidence has resulted in overwhelming agreement among climate scientists.\nNot only has there been scientific consensus on climate change for decades, there used to be political consensus as well. In the 1980s, George H. W. Bush—head of the Republican Party—pledged to fight climate change.\nSo how did a bipartisan issue turn so partisan? The story begins in the late 1980s. Three physicists began attacking the science linking smoking to cancer, the reality of acid rain, the severity of the ozone hole, and global warming. In short, they tried to discredit any scientific evidence showing that industries were harming the public’s health or the environment.\nWhy did these scientists turn against science? While the obvious suspect is money, it turns out their motives run deeper. They subscribed to a belief system called free market fundamentalism. This ideology holds that capitalism and personal freedom are inextricably linked. Even a small action like a tax on tobacco could be the start of a slippery slope of ever-increasing regulation, leading to government controlling every part of our lives.\nThe controversy about climate change is not about the science. It’s about how much the government should regulate the marketplace to protect the public. Believers in free markets dislike the implications of the science, so they deny there is a problem in the first place.\nCranky Uncle vs. Climate Change uses cartoons, climate science, and critical thinking to make sense of climate denial and misinformation. Guided by psychological research into how to refute misinformation, the book embraces a creative approach, using cartoons and visual analogies to make the science engaging and accessible to readers. The book is written and drawn by John Cook, a former cartoonist who now researches climate communication at George Mason University. Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change will be published by Kensington Books on Feb 25.

   "paragraph": "Australia's heat and bushfires are signs of fundamental shifts in its climate\nPosted on 20 January 2020 by greenman3610\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nAustralia’s “worst fire season ever recorded.” That’s how the Australian Broadcasting Company, among many others, aptly described as “an apocalypse,” “the gates of Hell,” or the “nightmare” bushfires that have enveloped much of the southeastern coast of the “land down under.”\nIt’s not that there haven’t been breath-taking bushfires and heat waves in the past in Australia. There certainly have been. But “the nature of them this year has changed,” experts say in this month’s “This is Not Cool” video by Peter Sinclair for Yale Climate Connections. It’s not just a drought that afflicts Australia nowadays, two experts agree, but a fundamental “shift in the storm track,” with a parching decline in rainfall, particularly during the Southern Hemisphere spring and summer months, becoming the proverbial “new normal.”\nIt’s the frequency and intensity of those conditions that is so concerning, says University of Melbourne scientist Linden Ashcroft. She says the trends are “exactly in line with what the [climate] science said 10 or 20 years ago.” Broadcast meteorologist Jeff Berardelli points to a single recent day on which the entire enormous continent of Australia recorded a country-wide average temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit. National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Kevin Trenberth says a single month of such high temperatures often can be tolerated without lasting damage, but at two months or longer, as with this year’s bushfire season, serious damages can set in and be long-lasting.\nAlso see: How climate change influenced Australia’s unprecedented fires"

Photo: Felix Lipov - Shutterstock\nAbout forty-five hundred years ago, not long after the completion of the Great Pyramid at Giza, a seed of Pinus longaeva, the Great Basin bristlecone pine, landed on a steep slope in what are now known as the White Mountains, in eastern California. The seed may have travelled there on a gust of wind, its flight aided by a winglike attachment to the nut. Or it could have been planted by a bird known as the Clark’s nutcracker, which likes to hide pine seeds in caches; nutcrackers have phenomenal spatial memory and can recall thousands of such caches. This seed, however, lay undisturbed. On a moist day in fall, or in the wake of melting snows in spring, a seedling appeared above ground—a stubby one-inch stem with a tuft of bright-green shoots.\n...\nWhat is most astonishing about Pinus longaeva is not the age of any single organism but the collective oldness and otherness of its entire community. No two super-elderly trees look alike, to the point where they have acquired the characteristics of individuals. Trees are prone to anthropomorphism; we project our dreams and our anxieties onto them. Bristlecones have been called elders, sentinels, sages. The possibility that climate change will cause their extinction has inspired a spate of alarmed news stories, although tree scientists tend to discount the idea that the bristlecones are in immediate danger.

   "title": "How climate change influenced Australia's unprecedented fires",
   "paragraph": "How climate change influenced Australia's unprecedented fires\nPosted on 18 January 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections, and has been adapted into a new myth rebuttal on climate-wildfire connections with the short URL sks.to/wildfires\nAustralia’s frightening bushfires, which kicked off an early fire season in September 2019, have already had cataclysmic effects, and the continent is still just in the early months of the southern hemisphere’s summer. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has described the bushfires as unprecedented in size and scale, having burned more than 46 million acres (18.6 million hectares), killed at least 29 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes.*\nParts of Australia have had the worst air quality in the world. The air quality in Sydney has literally been alarming, having set off smoke alarms in buildings throughout the city’s central business district and exceeded hazardous levels for more than 30 days. Military assets have been deployed in response to the fires at a scale not seen since World War II. Researchers estimate that more than a billion animals have been killed. Several species will likely be pushed to extinction.\nThe conditions and climate change-wildfire connections in Australia have been strikingly similar to those amplifying California’s record 2018 wildfire season, but on a much larger scale. Scientific unknowns remain regarding some of those connections, but others are a straightforward result of physics – more heat creates more wildfire fuel.\nThe politics and climate policy environment down under, on the other hand, more closely bring to mind those at the national level in the U.S. than to the situation in California.\nHow climate change exacerbated Australian and Californian fires\nDespite widespread conspiracy theories about the bushfires, emerging science continues to find links between global warming and worsening wildfires, with the issue a focus of continuing investigation. As climate scientist Kevin Trenberth explained in a recent interview with videographer Peter Sinclair, global warming directly intensifies wildfires by drying out soil and vegetation, creating more fuel to burn farther and faster. That’s particularly a problem in drought-prone regions like Australia and California.\nThe Millennium drought in southeastern Australia from 1997 to 2009 was the driest 13-year period on record, according to a report by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The drought was broken by Australia’s two wettest periods on record in 2010 and 2011, but then came yet another intense drought from 2017 to the present. In fact, 2018 and 2019 were Australia’s hottest and driest years on record. On December 18, the continent had its hottest day on record, with an average high temperature of 107.4 degrees F. California experienced a similar “weather whiplash,” swinging from record-breaking drought in 2012–2016 to a very wet rainy season in 2017–2018. That combination generated growth of new plants that were subsequently dried out by record heat, creating fuel for the state’s record 2018 wildfire season.\nCalifornia’s drought was made worse by a persistent high-pressure system off the coast known as the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge.” That high-pressure ridge diverted storm systems to California’s north, leading to years of low precipitation. Researchers have suggested that climate change may cause such blocking systems to form more frequently. A 2018 study led by UCLA’s Daniel Swain found that as temperatures continue to rise, California will see a shift to less precipitation in the spring and fall and more in the winter, lengthening the wildfire season.\nThe situation in Australia is again strikingly similar to that in California. Researchers have shown that global warming is expanding an atmospheric circulation pattern known as the Hadley cell. This circulation is caused by hot air at the equator rising and spreading toward the poles, where it begins to cool and descend, forming high pressure ridges. In Australia, this process creates what’s known as the subtropical ridge, which as CSIRO notes, has become more intense as a result of global warming expanding the Hadley cell circulation. A 2014 study, CSIRO’s David Post and colleagues reported that stronger high-pressure ridges have been decreasing rainfall in southeastern Australia in the autumn and winter. The significance? The lack of rainfall creates more dry fuel for fires and lengthens the bushfire season.\nBased on this scientific research, the latest IPCC report found in 2014 that “fire weather is projected to increase in most of southern Australia,” with days experiencing very high and extreme fire danger increasing 5-100% by 2050. And a 2015 CSIRO report concluded, “Extreme fire weather days have increased at 24 out of 38 Australian sites from 1973-2010, due to warmer and drier conditions … [forest fire danger index] increase across southeast Australia is characterised by an extension of the fire season further into spring and autumn … partly driven by temperature increases that are attributable to climate change.”\nAustralia has among the world’s worst climate policies\nAccording to the Climate Change Performance Index created by environmental groups, Australia is 56th out of 61 countries evaluated. In the category of climate policy, Australia comes in dead last with a score of zero because “experts observe that the newly elected government has continued to worsen performance at both national and international levels.”\nIn 2014, the Liberal Party (which, confusingly, is politically conservative by U.S. measures) became the first in the world to repeal a carbon tax. Echoing an approach taken by Oklahoma’s U.S. Senator James Inhofe on the floor of the Senate in 2015, Australia’s current Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison brought a lump of coal to the floor of the Australian House of Representatives in 2017. The country’s climate negotiators were accused of sabotaging the international climate agreement in Madrid in 2019, as they tried to use old “carry-over” carbon credits from the Kyoto Protocol to meet current climate goals.\nAustralia is the world’s leading exporter of coal and the second-largest producer and exporter of liquid natural gas, and the government recently proposed opening new coal mines and ports in what would be one of the world’s largest fossil fuel expansions. According to a recent report produced by the United Nations Environment Programme, Australia’s fossil fuel extraction-based emissions will nearly double from 2005 to 2030. In November, the Swedish central bank divested from Australian government bonds because of the country’s high emissions. Despite all this, as record bushfires continue to rage, Liberal Party leaders have maintained their position that Australia does not need stronger climate policies.\nIn short, as the country’s citizens and many visitors get a glimpse at its potentially dystopian future of worsening droughts and bushfires, its political leaders are doing everything they can to increase the fossil fuel extraction and combustion that experts conclude are exacerbating these extreme events. If the Paris climate goals are exceeded, the current record Australian temperatures will become the norm for the country. The public appears increasingly concerned: In a November Guardian Essential poll, 60% of Australian voters said the government should do more to reduce risks posed by the warming climate, and this concern has been clear in U.S. network and cable TV coverage of Australian citizens’ reactions to the fires. But Morrison and his Liberal party nonetheless prevailed in the last federal election in May 2019, and barring an early dissolution, they won’t face re-election until 2022."

Ideology and the Narrative of Skepticism (open access) starts with some arguably frightening false connections between the science and policy outcomes of climate change with other drivers of social anxiety among people who reject what we know about climate change. Lejano moves on to identify some possible ways forward. Among those: \"Climate skeptics need to be listened to, taken seriously, and respected.\" Finding a way to respect people expressing racial and other brands of bigotry (as identified in the paper) as a justification for ignoring facts is a bit of a large ask. Leaving that aside, Lejano's work seems to confirm general findings of much other work, and his conclusions about improving the flow and efficacy of climate communications are thought-provoking.

   "paragraph": "'Cranky Uncle' smart phone game will show you how to disarm climate deniers\nPosted on 15 January 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Bud Ward\n(Image: Courtesy of John Cook)\nWhen it comes to climate change, it seems every family has its own version of the proverbial Cranky Uncle. An uncle, cousin, grandparent, in-law, neighbor, whatever. Just think back to the recent holiday season’s large family get-togethers.\nThey’re everywhere.\nAnd now your unique climate change version of Cranky Uncle will soon be yours for the asking for your delight and edification. This version will be unlike other flavors you’ve personally endured: This is a case in which folks wanting to better understand and teach about climate change are more likely to seek out the Cranky Uncle than to have to endure repeated visits from him.\nThe prototype version of the “Cranky Uncle” game, developed by John Cook, the founder of the popular skepticalscience.com website, is a product of Cook’s own years of experience in social science research as it applies to climate change. A researcher at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, Cook says he’s been developing the online prototype for the game to “inoculate people against misinformation by explaining the techniques used to mislead them,” primarily using humor and cartoons.\nCritical thinking about climate science is ’empowering’\n“Teaching students how to evaluate claims using evidence and logic is my primary objective,” Cook emphasized in a recent email. “But these skills are not only for scientists. As citizens in a world full of misinformation, learning how to think critically is the best way to avoid being misled. Simply put, critical thinking is empowering.”\nCook illustrates clearly throughout the prototype that he recognizes that such critical thinking does not come naturally to just anyone. Instead, “it requires hard work and practice to overcome our biased and irrational brains,” he says. The game – be forewarned, it may be addictive even for those well-steeped on the details of the climate system – teaches in ways that are “fun and engaging.” Cook could well have added somewhat humbling also, as even those having a fairly sophisticated understanding of the issue may find themselves flubbing a multiple-choice question here and there.\n(Image: Courtesy of John Cook)\nWhile the archetype lead character in the game may impress himself with his “gotcha” arguments against mainstream science, he’s actually committing common logical fallacies, says Cook. He says that rather than being frustrated by an inability to counter “bad arguments,” players learn to rebut them, “hysterically making Cranky Uncle crankier throughout the game.”\nCook can easily go on at length about the “formidable social and psychological challenges” to be overcome in putting the game together. Among them, fast thinking (instinctive) as opposed to slow thinking (effortful and challenging); tribalism as with political affiliation, which he calls “the greatest driver of climate denial”; and echo chambers, peoples’ tendency to consume information that reaffirms their existing preferences and viewpoints.\nHe says he turned as an academic researcher to “gamification” as a way to teach critical thinking.\nThrough interactive quizzes, points and rewards systems, and player-to-player competition, he hopes the iOS and Android games now being developed for release over the next few months will teach users to better assess arguments, rejecting spurious ones; spot fallacies; and sharpen their own critical thinking when it comes to climate change science.\nCook and colleagues have done some limited field testing of the pilot game in schools and in college and university classes, and he says “critical thinking ability increased after just 30 minutes of game-play.”\nThrough his crankyuncle.com website, he’s been doing some crowdfunding to support official development of the coming iOS and Android versions, building on the foundations of the web-based prototype, which itself is not available for test-drives. Cook says the online fundraising effort has exceeded initial goals and now provides enough support to move forward with the iOS and Android versions. He expects to launch them in late June and late September respectively, and work has begun on German-language versions. Other languages are in a queue beyond then."

   "paragraph": "I had an intense conversation at work today.\nPosted on 13 January 2020 by Guest Author\nClaire Cohen-Norris volunteers with Citizens Climate Lobby as a chapter founder and leader in rural New York. Her climate advocacy sprung from her drive to provide a secure, joyful and fulfilling life for her two wonderful children. It has become a life’s mission, shared with her like-minded husband and partner. Claire earned her biology degree from Mount Holyoke College and her law degree from Tulane Law School. She has taught high school biology and environmental science since 1996.\nI had an intense conversation at work today.\nThere is a man with whom I work that dismisses climate change. He is a good man who works hard. He and I talk from time to time. At one point, we talked cars. He likes muscle cars, but he was curious about my electric car. So we talked EVs. The savings on maintenance sounded really appealing to him. He said he would check into them for his wife's next car. I offered a test drive. He may take me up on it when the weather is nice.\nFast forward to this week.\nHe is from Puerto Rico, as are quite a few of the people that work in my school district. There have been a lot of anxious and worried faces and a lot of talk about the earthquakes. Someone suggested that the earthquakes were caused by oil drilling. He looked at me to see what I had to say. I said that I didn't think traditional offshore drilling is associated with increased seismic activity. He was surprised. He expected me to say the earthquakes were caused by oil drilling. I said I wasn't sure what drilling was happening there, that there is clear evidence that fracking increases incidence of earthquakes all across the midwest, but not something like this. I said I would read up on it. I looked up to see what offshore drilling is happening in PR. It appears that in 2013, it was determined that there were no appreciable oil or gas deposits there. I came back to him and told him this.\nThat conversation gained his trust in a way that no other conversation could have. He did not expect me to be thinking critically. He expected me to be guided only by motivated reasoning. My integrity and honesty gained his trust.\nAnd I relied on that trust today.\nI said, if, in fact, I got the facts right and there is no offshore drilling in PR, PR should be very, very glad. Yes, it wouldn't cause these earthquakes. But one spill, and the tourism industry of PR would be destroyed. I said, why anyone would put up an offshore oil rig when they could put up an offshore wind farm is beyond me.\nThen I looked right at him and I said \"we have to get off gas, oil and coal. We must end its use, completely. Look at Australia.\" He nodded about poor Australia...but replied that he read those fires were started by arsonists. He allowed me to explain how greenhouse gases work and that the warming was drying the forests and making them burn more fiercely, no matter the cause of the spark. We talked about how the climate here in New York has changed. He said \"it is supposed to be 60 this Saturday. Sixty!\" Then he said, \"but what about God?\"\nAnd I replied \"I am not religious, but I know of an Evangelical Christian climate scientist who is married to an Evangelical Minister and she points out that the Bible says that we must take care of God's creation.\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"but God is more powerful than humans.\"\nAnd I said \"if your neighbor throws his trash on your yard, does that mean that God is not all powerful?\" \"No, of course not,\" he replied.\n\"We are throwing our garbage all over the skies. We cannot see it but it is there. God helps those who help themselves.\"\nHe answered \"then our grandchildren and great grandchildren will suffer...\"\n\"No,\" I said. \"We are suffering already. Look at Australia.\"\nHe got very quiet.\nI repeated, \"I am not religious. But I believe we have an obligation ...\" He cut me off \"of course.\" I said, \"an obligation not just to stop harming others, but to step in where others are harmed. We must stop using fossil fuels, or all the work we do for our children will be for nothing.\"\nMy eyes were all welled up. He listened, quietly.\nTomorrow? Maybe we will talk about cars again.\n(illustration: The Science Nature Academy)"

Video of the Week... Coming Soon on SkS... Climate Feedback Claim Review... SkS Week in Review... Poster of the Week...\nStory of the Week...\nStudy Confirms Climate Models are Getting Future Warming Projections Right\nAn animation of a GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) climate model simulation made for the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, showing five-year averaged surface air temperature anomalies in degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2100. The temperature anomaly is a measure of how much warmer or colder it is at a particular place and time than the long-term mean temperature, defined as the average temperature over the 30-year base period from 1951 to 1980. Blue areas represent cool areas and yellow and red areas represent warmer areas. The number in the upper right corner represents the global mean anomaly. Credit:NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies\nThere’s an old saying that “the proof is in the pudding,” meaning that you can only truly gauge the quality of something once it’s been put to a test. Such is the case with climate models: mathematical computer simulations of the various factors that interact to affect Earth’s climate, such as our atmosphere, ocean, ice, land surface and the Sun.\nFor decades, people have legitimately wondered how well climate models perform in predicting future climate conditions. Based on solid physics and the best understanding of the Earth system available, they skillfully reproduce observed data. Nevertheless, they have a wide response to increasing carbon dioxide levels, and many uncertainties remain in the details.

   "title": "Fossil fuel political giving outdistances renewables 13 to one",
   "paragraph": "Fossil fuel political giving outdistances renewables 13 to one\nPosted on 9 January 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Karin Kirk\nCorporations, special interest groups, and individuals inject billions of dollars into the American political system every year. Much of the financial support in politics is concealed from public view, as some rules – and loopholes – allow “dark money” and undisclosed donors to remain behind a wall. But some of those contributions can be traced via the Federal Election Commission, the IRS, congressional public records offices, and other resources.\nThe Open Secrets database, for instance, shines a light on this often murky process. The website is the work of the Center for Responsive Politics, whose stated mission is to improve transparency and citizen engagement around the influences of money in public policy. The website uses existing transparency laws to track the finances of candidates, political parties, lobbyists, and outside groups, and it describes ways cash is funneled through the system.\nFew seriously question whether fossil fuel money in politics has played a substantial role in climate change and energy policy, and some researchers say it’s the single most important reason climate action has been stalled for decades in the U.S. Investigative reporting by InsideClimate News showed that Exxon and other oil companies have spent more than $5 billion undermining climate science and fighting clean energy policies. It reported in a 2017 article on how money circulated through multiple channels:\nThe industry sowed doubt for decades about climate science, spending $2.9 billion on advocacy advertising alone in a 10-year period ending in 2015. It spent $1.3 billion more lobbying to shape public policy on energy issues during the same period and has pumped out $827.9 million in campaign contributions since 2000 to elect sympathetic officials at the local, state and federal levels.\nWhile the breadth of fossil fuel spending on climate policy and political issues is not surprising, the scope and scale is perhaps best understood when hard numbers are brought out to daylight.\nFossil fuel interests outspend renewable energy by more than 13 to 1\nDuring the 2017-2018 midterm election cycle, corporations, individuals, and trade groups in the fossil fuel industry spent $265,773,915 in lobbying and $93,392,002 in contributions to national-level candidates, parties, and outside groups, bringing the total spending by the industry to more than $359 million in two years. That’s nearly $500,000 per day.\nDuring the same period, renewable energy companies spent $26 million. So for every dollar spent on behalf of wind, solar, or hydroelectric energy interests, approximately $13.70 was spent by fossil fuel interests on energy and climate-related issues.\nThose figures do not include all lobbying spending because of complex rules, and the Open Secrets database reflects only money circulating at the federal level, but the same things are at work in state-level offices. For instance, on recent statewide ballot initiatives the oil, gas, and coal industries spent $31 million in Arizona and $30 million in Washington to defeat clean energy measures. And at the same time, fossil fuel companies spend to directly influence the public via the airwaves, mailings, astroturf organizations, and social media campaigns.\nKoch, ExxonMobil, and Chevron top 3 in political spending\nThe leading campaign donors and lobbyists are power houses in the fossil fuel industry, led by Koch Industries, which gave more than $10 million to campaign coffers in the 2018 midterms and used another $20 million for lobbying efforts in 2017 through 2018. ExxonMobil and Chevron ranked second and third in spending, and ExxonMobil was the largest energy lobbyist in that two-year period, spending more than $22 million on strategic messaging with political leaders.\nFossil fuel campaign donations go mostly to Republicans\nU.S. senators representing principal fossil fuel-producing states, not surprisingly, have accumulated the largest sums from the industry. Those who have made presidential bids received the largest corporate donations. For example, Mitt Romney has received more fossil fuel money than any other U.S. senator, with a career total $8.5 million from oil, gas, and coal interests. About $6.9 million of this money was received during his 2012 presidential race. All told, Romney’s fossil fuel funding is more than double that of any other federal lawmaker; a typical family in Romney’s adopted home state of Utah would have to work for 125 years to earn the money he has been given by these industries.\nFossil fuel money in politics tilts overwhelmingly toward Republicans. Oil and gas companies give 87% of their donations to Republicans, coal companies 95% of their campaign funds to GOP politicians. In listing currently serving U.S. senators with the most backing from fossil fuel interests, it’s not until the 17th slot that a Democrat appears, Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\nCurrent Senators with over $1 million in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry:\nRomney, Mitt (R-UT) – $8,577,658\nCornyn, John (R-TX) – $3,790,755\nCruz, Ted (R-TX) – $3,684,350\nMcConnell, Mitch (R-KY) – $3,230,078\nInhofe, James M (R-OK) – $2,239,385\nMurkowski, Lisa (R-AK) – $1,628,230\nGardner, Cory (R-CO) – $1,624,820\nCassidy, Bill (R-LA) – $1,571,345\nBlunt, Roy (R-MO) – $1,519,341\nCapito, Shelley Moore (R-WV) – $1,452,354\nBarrasso, John A (R-WY) – $1,330,372\nCramer, Kevin (R-ND) – $1,302,846\nRubio, Marco (R-FL) – $1,298,887\nToomey, Pat (R-PA) – $1,284,979\nPortman, Rob (R-OH) – $1,279,355\nLankford, James (R-OK) – $1,255,270\nManchin, Joe (D-WV) – $1,008,268\nBut Democrats have also received fossil fuel financial backing. Barack Obama ranks No. 7 and Hillary Clinton No. 11 on the list of current and former senators with the most funding from the oil and gas industry, with over $2 million of campaign donations to Obama and $1.5 million to Clinton. As with Romney, most of these donations were made during their presidential campaigns.\nHow do your U.S. senators and others stack up?\nThe Open Secrets website is fairly intuitive to search, and a few minutes searching on a candidate, elected official, PAC, or corporation will likely yield rewarding results. For example, the database makes it easy to check on one’s own senators by looking at their funding from oil and gas and coal mining corporations. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives can be similarly tracked to show their oil and gas and coal mining funding connections.\nOther avenues for exploration are the donors, recipients, and lobbying activities in specific industries. Useful starting points are oil and gas, coal mining, or alternative energy. Note that the alternative energy sector includes biofuels, nuclear energy, and a few natural gas companies, along with renewable energy companies. In order to tally the financial involvement of the renewable energy sector, one needs to evaluate each specific company within the alternate energy category and winnow out those related to wind, solar, hydropower, batteries, and grid management.\nThose interested can also explore the involvement of a specific corporation, such as Koch Industries, ExxonMobil, or Chevron. The database shows the recipients of corporate donations and discloses lobbying activity on specific pieces of legislation.\nFor state and local offices, the Follow the Money database allows a detailed drill-down into candidates and public officials. With a little digging, it’s not hard to locate campaign contributions for one’s governor or state legislators.\nSleuthing through these records reveals an expansive breadth and depth of corporate funding of elected office holders. Some of them pledge to serve the public interest rather than uphold partisan interests: It’s up to the electorate to evaluate how they’re measuring up to those pledges."

   "paragraph": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #1, 2020\nPosted on 8 January 2020 by doug_bostrom\nSupply Side\nHow are we doing with CO2 emissions? It's an important question, increasingly posed to a mixed bag of CO2 contributors who may or may not provide accurate reportage. Liu et al present a new, additional means of measurement based on satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide co-emitted from coal-fired power plants, in A methodology to constrain carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants using satellite observations of co-emitted nitrogen dioxide (open access). From the abstract:\nThe broader implication of our methodology is that it has the potential to provide an additional constraint on CO2 emissions from power plants in regions of the world without reliable emissions accounting. We explore the feasibility by comparing the derived NOx∕CO2 emission ratios for the US with those from a bottom-up emission inventory for other countries and applying our methodology to a power plant in South Africa, where the satellite-based emission estimates show reasonable consistency with other independent estimates. Though our analysis is limited to a few power plants, we expect to be able to apply our method to more US (and world) power plants when multi-year data records become available from new OMI-like sensors with improved capabilities, such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and upcoming geostationary satellites, such as the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution (TEMPO) instrument.\n55 Articles\nObservations & observational methods of global warming & effects\nHuman fingerprint in global weather\nClimate change now detectable from any single day of weather at global scale\nProcesses driving global interior ocean pH distribution\nSignature of Ocean Warming at the Mixed Layer Base\nSeasonal and intra-seasonal rainfall and drought characteristics as indicators of climate change and variability in Southern Africa: a focus on Kabwe and Livingstone in Zambia\nModeling, simulation and assessment of global warming & global warming impacts\nWater level changes, subsidence, and sea level rise in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta (open access)\nRobust increases in extreme Pacific North American events under greenhouse warming\nImpact of climate change on sea surface wind in Southeast Asia, from climatological average to extreme events: results from a dynamical downscaling\nThe impact of wintertime sea-ice anomalies on high surface heat flux events in the Iceland and Greenland Seas\nClimate model advancement\nGlobal variability in radiative-convective equilibrium with a slab ocean under a wide range of CO2 concentrations (open access)\nData Assimilation for Climate Research: Model Parameter Estimation of Large Scale Condensation Scheme\nCauses of higher climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models\nRevisiting the impact of sea salt on climate sensitivity\nThe impact of sea surface temperature biases on North American precipitation in a high-resolution climate model\nThe Impacts of Horizontal Resolution on the Seasonally Dependent Biases of the Northeastern Pacific ITCZ in Coupled Climate Models\nSensitivity of future climate change and uncertainty over India to performance-based model weighting\nCMIP5: a Monte Carlo assessment of changes in summertime precipitation characteristics under RCP8.5-sensitivity to annual cycle fidelity, overconfidence, and gaussianity\nBiology & global warming\nWarmth disfavours natives\nTree growth influenced by warming winter climate and summer moisture availability in northern temperate forests\nExperimental acidification increases susceptibility of Mercenaria mercenaria to infection by Vibrio species\nLight alters the responses of two marine diatoms to increased warming\nGHG sources & sinks, flux\nEnhanced carbon uptake and reduced methane emissions in a newly restored wetland\nObserving and Simulating Spatial Variations of Forest Carbon Stocks in Complex Terrain\nBurial and origin of permafrost derived carbon in the nearshore zone of the southern Canadian Beaufort Sea\nThe capacity of northern peatlands for long-term carbon sequestration (open access)\nOrganic Carbon Characteristics in Ice-rich Permafrost in Alas and Yedoma Deposits, Central Yakutia, Siberia (open access)\nA methodology to constrain carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants using satellite observations of co-emitted nitrogen dioxide (open access)\nDecomposing supply-side and demand-side impacts of climate change on the US electricity system through 2050\nConversion of coastal wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands increases greenhouse gas emissions: A global meta‐analysis\nDrivers of change in China’s energy-related CO2 emissions (open access)\nChina's aircraft-related CO2 emissions: Decomposition analysis, decoupling status, and future trends\nClimate change communications & cognition\nScientists’ incentives and attitudes toward public communication (open access)\nNational print media vs. agricultural trade publications: communicating the 2012 Midwestern US drought\nHumans dealing with our global warming\nClimate change adaptation strategies of small-scale farmers in Ngamiland East, Botswana\nDynamic projection of anthropogenic emissions in China: methodology and 2015–2050 emission pathways under a range of socioeconomic, climate policy, and pollution control scenarios (open access)\nAssessing the impact of climate changes on the potential yields of maize and paddy rice in Northeast China by 2050\nPotential impacts of climate change factors and agronomic adaptation strategies on wheat yields in central highlands of Ethiopia\nDoes renewable energy efficiently spur economic growth?

   "title": "2019 in climate science: A continued warming trend and 'bleak' research",
   "paragraph": "2019 in climate science: A continued warming trend and 'bleak' research\nPosted on 7 January 2020 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nThe last six years have been the six hottest globally ever recorded by humans.\n2014 had been the hottest year up to that point, until the record was shattered in 2015, and again in 2016 thanks to a monster El Niño event. El Niños bring hot water up to the ocean surface where it warms the temperature of the surface air that most directly influences and interests humanity. Next came 2017, the second-hottest year recorded by humans, but far and away the hottest that wasn’t influenced by an El Niño event. And then 2018, the fourth-hottest overall, but by far the hottest year on record that was cooled by a La Niña event.\nAnd now 2019, warmed by a moderate El Niño event and as such not as hot as 2016 with its monster El Niño; but it was nevertheless the second-hottest year on record, and quite possibly the second-hottest in the history of human civilization.\nAs global warming has continued, so too has the volume of peer-reviewed reports and studies published by climate scientists documenting its accelerating impacts. Here are some of the most influential climate change research papers published in calendar 2019.\nUnited Nations IPCC reports\nThe U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published two special reports in 2019, one documenting climate change impacts on land and food security, the other on the oceans and ice. Both reports warned that the risks of severe climate change impacts will grow as global temperatures warm beyond the 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) targets set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Food security will become increasingly threatened, as will important marine species and ecosystems like coral reefs. Melting ice sheets will continue to accelerate sea-level rise, and permafrost, once-but-no-longer-permanently frozen, will release increasing amounts of previously trapped carbon into the atmosphere as it thaws. Those are but a few of the growing climate change threats documented in the IPCC special reports, which were widely characterized as being “bleak.”\nA report produced by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in November 2019 also documented that countries’ planned fossil fuel extraction efforts will far overshoot the Paris climate targets. While global fossil fuel production and associated carbon emissions must peak and begin to fall within a few years to meet those goals, countries instead plan to continue increasing fossil fuel extraction through the year 2040, which would be consistent with a pathway of more than 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F) hotter than pre-industrial temperatures by the end of the century. This report highlighted an important disconnect between countries’ goals to curb global warming and their plans to continue extracting ever-more fossil fuels.\nScientists are becoming increasingly concerned and outspoken about this disconnect. In November, more than 11,000 scientists signed a letter published in the journal BioScience declaring “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.”\nAccording to Altmetric, which tracks which scientific research most captures the public’s interest each year, the UNEP report was the fourth-most influential scientific paper published in 2019, with coverage in 527 news outlets and 8,290 tweets.\nStudies on the climate of the ‘Common Era’\nClimate scientists’ best global temperature reconstructions cover the past 2,000 years, a period also known as the “Common Era.” Several studies investigating the details of temperature changes over the Common Era were published in 2019.\nIn July, the journal Nature published a study that looked for significant natural climate change events during that period, such as the Medieval Warm Period (approximately the years 950 to 1250) and the Little Ice Age (approximately 1300 to 1850). The authors reported that they “find no evidence for preindustrial globally coherent cold and warm epochs … the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98% of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures, but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years.”\nAccording to Altmetric, that Nature report was the 28th-most influential scientific paper of 2019, with coverage in 264 news outlets and 1,930 tweets.\nThe Past Global Changes consortium of more than 5,000 scientists from some 125 countries published its newest reconstruction of global temperatures over the Common Era in Nature Geoscience in July. That group similarly concluded, “The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.”\nA study published in Quaternary Science Reviews in March 2019 sought to determine whether the arrival of Europeans in the Americas in 1492 and the subsequent large-scale massacres of native populations (an estimated 56 million deaths by 1600, shrinking the indigenous population 90%) had a detectable influence on the global climate. Forests re-grew on land previously altered by humans, which the authors estimated led to “5 ppm CO2 additional uptake into the land surface in the 1500s compared to the 1400s … The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth System in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution.”\nAccording to Altmetric, the Quaternary Science Reviews study was the 46th-most influential scientific paper of 2019, with coverage in 101 news outlets and 4,141 tweets.\nResearch in 2019 on coral reefs\nCoral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world and a critical source of food and habitat for about 25% of the ocean’s fish. They’re also among the species and ecosystems most vulnerable to the changing climate, and thus are the subject of much scientific research.\nResearchers published a study in Nature Climate Change exploring the resilience of Great Barrier Reef corals that had survived an extreme hot year in 2016 only to be hard-hit again by extreme heat the following year. The results offered a rare source of encouragement, finding that corals that survived 2016 without bleaching were also more resistant to bleaching in 2017.\nAccording to Altmetric, that study was the 14th-most influential scientific paper of 2019, with coverage in 47 news outlets and 6,228 tweets celebrating the good news.\nThe 22nd-most influential paper, with coverage in 98 news outlets with 4,812 tweets, however, painted a bleaker picture for the Great Barrier Reef. Published in Nature in April, authors of the study found that larval recruitment (the settlement of fish and coral larvae necessary for a healthy ecosystem) declined 89% in 2018 after those two extreme hot years. This study received a boost of media attention in November, when in a Nature Communications study, scientists used underwater speakers to replicate the sounds of healthy coral reefs. They found that twice as many fish arrived and stayed as in areas where no sound was played. This finding provides some hope that coral reef ecosystem recovery could be accelerated – if the reefs aren’t continually battered year after year by extreme heat.\nThe year’s major findings on flora and fauna\nLand species also were the subject of several influential papers published in 2019. One published in Science in July estimated the number of trees that could be planted and the amount of carbon they could pull out of the atmosphere. “Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25% increase in forested area, including more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity.” Those numbers would represent a removal of about one-third of cumulative human carbon emissions through current times, and 20 years’ worth at the current rate of about 10 billion tons of carbon per year. However, some scientific groups disputed the accuracy of these estimates, which also rely on foresting every available hectare of land. Nevertheless, the study was Altmetric’s 9th-most influential of 2019, with coverage in 330 news outlets and 6,518 tweets.\nTwo 2019 studies finding alarming rates of species extinctions were also high on Altmetric’s list. One published in Biological Conservation in April found “dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world’s insect species over the next few decades” as a result of various human factors including climate change, which “is particularly important in tropical regions.” This study was Altmetric’s 13th-most influential of the year, with coverage in 251 news outlets and 4,679 tweets.\nIn the second study, published in Science in October, researchers surveyed bird species and found “a net loss approaching three billion birds, or 29% of 1970 abundance” as a result of “habitat loss, agricultural intensification, coastal disturbance, and direct anthropogenic mortality, all exacerbated by climate change.” That study was Altmetric’s 34th-most influential paper, with coverage in 259 news outlets and 1,465 tweets.\nThese studies are consistent with the “bleak” notion that Earth is currently on a path to its sixth mass extinction event. (An upcoming post at this site will look in depth at major 2019 research reports addressing wildlife and climate change.)\nThe past year’s major findings on melting ice\nSeveral high-profile papers in 2019 also addressed the accelerating melting of ice and its implications. One, published in Science Advances in June, found that since 2001, Himalayan glaciers have been losing ice at a rate twice as fast as they had in the prior 25 years. Those glaciers provide an important source of water for billions of people in China, India, Pakistan, and several other countries in the region. The paper was Altmetric’s 65th-most influential, with coverage in 294 news outlets and 414 tweets.\nA January study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that over the past decade, Antarctica has been losing ice at a rate six times faster than during the 1980s. And another paper published in PNAS in June asking experts about future sea-level rise projections found that because of accelerating ice sheet declines, a rise of more than two meters (about six feet) by the year 2100 remains within the realm of possibility. Those were the 86th- and 70th-most influential papers of 2019, respectively.\nOverall, the second-hottest year was, sadly but perhaps unsurprisingly, full of bleak news in climate science research. Climate scientists’ findings and reports increasingly raise the alarm of a “climate emergency” or “climate crisis” – terms that many in the mainstream media began to use regularly in 2019 without feeling the need to qualify or use quotes. Because of climate scientists’ increasingly concerning research findings and language, climate crisis is becoming more widely accepted and used as the norm."

   "title": "Doubling down: Researchers investigate compound climate risks",
   "paragraph": "Doubling down: Researchers investigate compound climate risks\nPosted on 6 January 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Daniel Grossman\nIt was a grim day in Moscow on July 25, 2010. The English-language Moscow Times reported that the Russian capital had broken the 1936 temperature record for July: 98 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThat month, the city, where air conditioning was (and still is) rare, was an average of 32 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than a normal July.\nPlumes of smoke rising from peat bogs burning in the distance wafted through Moscow’s central Presnensky district. The newspaper reported that “grass has dried down to straw,” and trees were dropping leaves and dying from dehydration.\nThe mega heatwave – since designated eastern Europe’s hottest episode in 500 years – affected an area as large as Mexico. By the time it abated it had caused 55,000 deaths from respiratory failure and other disorders caused by heat and air pollution from wildfires. It had destroyed one-third of Russia’s grain harvest.\nJakob Zscheischler, a senior scientist at the Climate and Environmental Physics group at the University of Bern, calls the 2010 incident a quintessential compound climate event, a weather disaster intensified by the combined effect of two or more factors. In this case, a heat spike reinforced by a prolonged drought produced the second most deadly heatwave in history after the western European heatwave of 2003. Climate change could make compound events more likely, Zscheischler says.\nWhen it rains … it often really does pour\nResearchers generally study the intensity and likelihood of heatwaves, droughts, and other adverse climate incidents in isolation, as if the incidents were independent phenomena that don’t interact with each other. Radley Horton, a Columbia University climate science professor, who had helped organize the world’s first international workshop on compound events, says that such phenomena are often not independent at all and that assuming they are can lead to unreliable results. “Relying on climate models to look at single variables could understate the risk because of the way these extreme events interact,” he said in a phone call.\nResearch on the 2010 Russian heatwave illustrates how taking more than one factor into account can improve estimates of the likelihood that an adverse event will recur, and of the degree to which climate change can be held responsible for it.\nThough climate scientists have generally analyzed the incidence of drought and elevated heat in isolation, they have known for decades that the two phenomena go hand in hand, each making the other worse. The causal connection between them is easily explained by the well-known relationship between air and moisture in the soil, an effect called land-atmosphere feedback.\nWhen temperature increases so too does the amount of water evaporating from the ground. Even if precipitation remains unchanged, soils become drier – a defining characteristic of drought – when temperature goes up, reducing the availability of moisture for forests, crops, and urban gardens. By the same token, soil moisture regulates regional air temperature. Wetter soil absorbs more heat. So unseasonably low rainfall dries soil and raises temperature.\nWhen six plus three equals 13?\nAuthors of several papers have studied the Russian heatwave as a compound event with land-atmosphere feedback. Authors of a 2016 publication concluded that climate change increases the likelihood of a devastating heatwave by a factor of six. Low soil moisture increases the likelihood by a factor of three. The combined effect of drought and climate change raises the probability of such a heatwave by a factor of 13.\nAnother compound event attracting close attention is the combined impact of ocean surge and river flooding on coastal cities. Surge temporarily increases sea level when high wind pushes water against the shore. River flooding occurs when heavy rain swells waterways.\nEither surge or river flooding alone can swamp a city, threatening large losses of property and life. In 2011 Hurricane Irene caused $15 billion in damage, much of it caused by raging rivers swollen by intense rainfall. In 2012, in contrast, it was storm surge that made Superstorm Sandy one of the most costly natural disasters in U.S. history. High tide in New York was nine feet above normal, inundating entire neighborhoods, flooding subway lines, and shorting out parts of the electrical grid.\nWhen the surge of Sandy meets the rainfall of Irene …\nHorton advises that disaster planners consider the possibility that a future storm could combine the offshore surge of Sandy with the heavy rainfall of Irene. Prevented by elevated tides from draining into the ocean, rivers in flood would overrun the coast at their mouths. A 2015 analysis of weather records concluded that simultaneous ocean surge and heavy rainfall has become more common at major coastal cities of the contiguous U.S. “That combination could potentially lead to greater risk and loss of life,” Horton said.\nResearchers at the recent Columbia University workshop distinguished between several varieties of compound events (sometimes called correlated extremes). Not all are incidents enhanced by multiple factors occurring in synchrony such as drought-enhanced heatwaves or surge exacerbated by rain.\nAnother kind includes episodes occurring roughly simultaneously but far from each other. The El Niño weather pattern is a well-known example of how atmospheric conditions can change all at once in places separated by great distances. During an El Niño, drought descends on the Amazon and the U.S. Pacific Northwest, while heavier rains fall in the southeastern U.S. and British Columbia. Researchers have identified other climate phenomena, connecting far-flung parts of the world by often-poorly understood “teleconnections.” Could such events cause previously unanticipated problems? Researchers are striving to better understand and answer that question.\nIn a world dependent on far-flung shipments of food, fuel, and manufactured goods produced in and shipped through a small number of key centers, simultaneous climate disasters could create widespread economic and humanitarian disaster. For instance, Horton worries that drought and high heat could cause crop failure in the breadbaskets of the Ukraine, central Europe, and the U.S. “You could see big changes in crop prices and big implications on food security, and potential repercussions in terms of conflict and migration as well.”\nRecent research justifies Horton’s concern. Authors of one paper published last March have teased out relationships between adverse growing conditions in the world’s top wheat-growing regions. Among other findings, they noted a suggestive relationship between hot, dry periods in the E.U. and Australia. And authors of a paper published in June 2018 concluded that global warming will dramatically increase the likelihood that the world’s four top maize producing regions will have simultaneously climate-related crop losses.\nMore questions now than answers = more research to come\nJane Baldwin, a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, is studying another kind of compound event made up of a repeated series of short, extreme incidents. She wonders if a succession of short temperature spikes, each too brief to fit the definition of a heatwave, could be as deadly as a longer spell of high heat officially designated as a heatwave. Last April she and several colleagues at Princeton published a paper showing that climate change is increasingly the likelihood of such short extremes of heat. “We should be thinking if having multiple heatwaves in sequence matters,” says Baldwin. She’s continuing her research with epidemiologists to find out.\nGeoscience professor Michael Oppenheimer, at Princeton, says he thinks the Columbia University conference – which he helped put on – “signaled a broad interest in compound events in the climate community.” Zscheischler, who has written prominent papers on compound events in Nature Climate Change and Science Advances, says that so far researchers have raised more questions about the subject than they have answered. But, he added, “I’m sure there will be a lot of research in the next couple of years on the topic.”"

(NOAA)\nFor the first time, scientists have detected the “fingerprint” of human-induced climate change on daily weather patterns at the global scale. If verified by subsequent work, the findings, published Thursday in Nature Climate Change, would upend the long-established narrative that daily weather is distinct from long-term climate change.\nThe study’s results also imply that research aimed at assessing the human role in contributing to extreme weather events such as heat waves and floods may be underestimating the contribution.\nThe new study, which was in part motivated by President Trump’s tweets about how a cold day in one particular location disproves global warming, uses statistical techniques and climate model simulations to evaluate how daily temperatures and humidity vary around the world. Scientists compared the spatial patterns of these variables with what physical science shows is expected because of climate change.\nThe study concludes that the spatial patterns of global temperature and humidity are, in fact, distinguishable from natural variability, and have a human component to them. Going further, the study concludes that the long-term climate trend in global average temperature can be predicted if you know a single day’s weather information worldwide.\nThe signal of human-caused climate change has emerged in everyday weather, study finds by Paul Freedman, Capital Weather Gang, Washington Post, Jan 2, 2020\nClick here to access the complete article as published on the Washington Post website.\nEditorial of the Week...\nWe are seeing the very worst of our scientific predictions come to pass in these bushfires\nAs a climate scientist I am wondering if the Earth system has now breached a tipping point\n‘The thing that really terrifies me is that weather conditions considered extreme by today’s standards will seem sedate in the future.’ Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP via Getty Images\nAs a climate scientist, the thing that really terrifies me is that weather conditions considered extreme by today’s standards will seem sedate in the future.

It’s human nature.\nAnd so perhaps it’s not surprising that we’ve spent the past decade or so outlining what a “safe” level of global warming is. Language reflecting the conception of “safe” global heating abounds in scientific literature, climate negotiations, and the press. The Paris Agreement enshrined the idea that 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) as pretty safe. Advocacy from small island nations and others has made a compelling case that 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) would be safer still, allowing, at least, for their continued existence. At various times, each of these levels of heating have been called a “guardrail,” “defence line,” and “buffer zone.” On one side, dangerous climate change. On the other, something we can figure out and adapt to if we play our cards right.\nRecently, the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold appears to have won out as our best bet for safety. And over the next decade, the world will decide its fate of whether it can limit heating to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. But we don’t have to wait to find out if that level of heating is safe because the answer is right in front of us.

   "paragraph": "Few countries on track to meet Paris climate goals\nPosted on 4 January 2020 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nTo meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, countries need to cut carbon pollution – fast.\nBut Bill Hare of the research think tank Climate Analytics says most countries are not on track. Climate Analytics partners on a project called the Climate Action Tracker. It analyzes the impact of climate policies in 32 countries that produce about 80% of global emissions.\nHare says some have adopted policies that could significantly reduce carbon pollution.\n“If you take India as an example,” he says, “there’s a lot going on in renewable energy and electric vehicles, for example, that wasn’t really happening five or more years ago.”\nBut he says most countries’ efforts are insufficient. Climate Action Tracker estimates that based on countries’ current policies, temperatures will likely rise by more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That could cause catastrophic sea-level rise and devastating weather extremes.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, meeting the Paris goals is still feasible. But Hare says it won’t happen unless countries implement far more ambitious policies on climate.\n“The urgency on the policy side is getting more and more acute,” he says."

   "title": "2019 in Review: another busy year for the Skeptical Science team",
   "paragraph": "2019 in Review: another busy year for the Skeptical Science team\nPosted on 31 December 2019 by BaerbelW\nAs we wrap up 2019 and prepare for 2020, here is our annual review of what our team was up to during the year. As in previous recaps, this one is divided into several sections:\nScholary publications, projects and books\nOther publications and activities\nRecorded talks and podcasts\nOur MOOC Denial101x\nConferences\nWebsite activities\nRebuttal statistics\nDownloads\nTranslations\nSocial media\nCranky Uncle fundraising campaign\nScholarly publications, projects and books\nSeveral members of the SkS-team were lead- or co-authors of peer-reviewed papers published during 2019. Here is a list of some of them:\nIs emphasising consensus in climate science helpful for policymaking?\nJohn Cook\nIn Hulme, M. (Ed.), Contemporary Climate Change Debates (in press)\nTesting Logic-based and Humor-based Corrections for Science, Health, and Political Misinformation on Social Media\nEmily Vraga, Sojung Claire Kim, John Cook\nJournal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 63(3), 393-414\nUnderstanding and countering misinformation about climate change\nJohn Cook\nIn Samoilenko, S., & Chiluwa, I. (Eds.), Handbook of Research on Deception, Fake News, and Misinformation Online(pp. 281-306). Hershey, PA: IGI-Global\nTurning climate misinformation into an educational opportunity\nJohn Cook\nIn J. C. Fessmann (Ed.), Strategic Climate Change Communications: Effective Approaches to Fighting Climate Denial (pp. 27-44). Wilmington, DE: Vernon Press.\nScience by Social Media: Attitudes Towards Climate Change are Mediated by Perceived Social Consensus\nStephan Lewandowsky, John Cook, Nicolas Fay & Gilles Gignac\nMemory & Cognition\nAmerica Misled: How the fossil fuel industry deliberately misled Americans about climate change\nJohn Cook, Geoffrey Supran, Stephan Lewandowsky, Naomi Oreskes & Ed Maibach Fairfax, VA: George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication\nA Limited Role for Unforced Internal Variability in Twentieth-Century Warming\nKarsten Haustein, Friederike E. L. Otto, Victor Venema, Peter Jacobs, Kevin Cowtan, Zeke Hausfather, Robert G. Way, Bethan White, Aneesh Subramanian, and Andrew P. Schurer\nJournal of Climate, 32(16), 4893-4917\nComment on “The Impact of Recent Forcing and Ocean Heat Uptake Data on Estimates of Climate Sensitivity”\nKevin Cowtan and Peter Jacobs\nJournal of Climate, 33(1), 391-396.\nOur 2013 study Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature hit one million downloads on July 17! This makes it the #1 most downloaded paper at the journal Environmental Research Letters. In fact, it's the most downloaded paper in the 80+ journals published by the Institute of Physics. One million+ downloads are usually reserved for viral videos involving piano-playing cats. Not a bad effort for a peer-reviewed scientific paper!\nAbout two months later, Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming published in 2016 went past 500,000 downloads. As of this writing (Dec. 23, 2019) John Cook has three papers in ERL's list of ten most read papers: the already mentioned Cook et al. 2013 (#2) and Cook et al. 2016 (#3) as well as Cook et al. 2018 (#10).\nThe University of York's chemistry department and Kevin Cowtan will play an important role in the GloSAT project which commenced in October 2019. The project plans to accurately estimate global climate change since the start of the industrial era, using data collated since the days of the Clipper ships over 200 years ago. One source of early marine air temperature observations is the fleet of the English East India Company between 1789–1834 along trade routes from Europe to India and Southeast Asia. There are also observations from land stations before 1850 that have not yet been used in global datasets. GloSat will be led by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in collaboration with the Universities of York, Reading, East Anglia, Edinburgh and Southampton, as well as scientists from the Meteorological Office’s Hadley Centre.\nJohn Mason published the book \"The making of Ynyslas\", which he described in his blog post in October. Ynyslas is a well-known National Nature Reserve on the coast of Mid-Wales. The book is all about the deglaciation foillowing the last ice-age and the accompanying substantial global rise in sea levels. In one sense, it's an answer to the popular denialist argument, \"the climate's always changed\", since it shows in graphic detail what that can entail. In another, it's a novel and experimental way of communicating climate change, using a science-based narrative hard-wired to a real and well-loved place.\nOther Publications\nAs in previous years, members from our team again published articles in various other outlets:\nDana Nuccitelli wrote for Yale Climate Connections, The Guardian, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and DeSmogUK. John Cook had two articles in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and Stephan Lewandowsky published two articles in TheConversation.\nRecorded Talks, Podcasts and other outreach activities\nBärbel Winkler leveraged some of John Cook's \"Cranky Uncle\" fallacy cartoons in a quiz to identfiy logical fallacies at the Scientists for Future booth during the global climate strike on September 20. Dana Nuccitelli did an AMA on Reddit about climate science on November 5. John Cook discussed Climate Change and Cranky Uncles with Sofia Baca and Gabriel Hersch in episode #45 of the Breaking Math podcast published on December 10.\nSome presentations were recorded during the year:\n21 March 2019 Dana Nuccitelli - Truckee, California\n05 April 2019 Dana Nuccitelli - CCL webinar\n08 April 2019 Bärbel Winkler - 2-minute-madness about Denial101x\n24 April 2019 John Cook - Texas A&M University\n25 June 2019 John Cook - Elders Climate Action\n25 Nov. 2019 Bärbel Winkler - SAP Community Call\nOur MOOC Denial101x\nDenial101x was available throughout the year as one paced and one long-running self-paced version, with the latter attracting over 3.500 participants. At the moment, we are inbetween runs in order to \"regroup\" and to add some new videos before the next self-paced run starts on February 4, 2020. It will then be available throughout the year until mid-December. Registration is already open on edX.\nConferences\nIn April, Bärbel Winkler travelled again to Austria's capital Vienna to participate in the week-long European Geoscience Union's General Assembly. On Monday she did a presentation about Denial101x in Session EOS7.1 - Climate Change Education which was done in the interesting PICO-format which is a mixture of extremely short presentations, aptly named \"2-minute-madness\", and self-service presentations made available on large touchscreens.\nIn September Bärbel took part at the K3 conference about Climate, Communication and Society in Karlsruhe, Germany and offered a well attended workshop about misinformation on the 2nd day of the conference. Our German partnersite Klimafakten has a write-up about the workshop.\nZeke Hausfather presented a poster about Rethinking the definitions of modes of decadal climate variability during this year's AGU meeting in San Francisco.\nWebsite activities\nAt the beginning of the year we took the Pro-Truth-Pledge as an organisation - even if this may seem somewhat akin to \"stating the obvious\" as the rating of \"factual reporting: very high\" for Skeptical Science on Media Bias/FactCheck makes pretty clear! As we have been fighting misinformation about human-caused climate change since the website was launched in 2007, it seemed like a logical step to take.\nSeveral of our blog series kept getting published throughout the year with John Hartz leading the way with his weekly summaries and digests. Ari Jokimäki published his New Research posts on a weekly basis until mid-May and Doug Bostrom took over shortly afterwards. Dana Nuccitelli reposted his articles published in other outlets (see list above) and wrote several original articles for SkS. Several of Zeke Hausfather's CarbonBrief articles were reposted. Evan and jg added five analogies to their successful collaboration. Other members providing serveral articles were Riduna and Bärbel Winkler.\nAccording to our website statistics and the unique visitors counted per month, 2019 was a very good year for Skeptical Science as we had several months above 500,000 unique visitors during the second half of the year! The following chart shows this particular statistic for years we have data for, 2015 to 2019:\nNote: Data for May 2019 and January 2018 was missing in the stats so we tried to extrapolate it from the other months we had data for. Click for larger version or view with stacked years.\nRebuttal statistics\nAlthough lower than in 2018, the number of views for some of our rebuttals is still quite impressive, collecting well over 4.5 million views all told. \"Consensus\" again made first place (730,000+ views), \"Impacts\" (410,000+) came in 2nd, and \"Past\" 3rd with more than 350,000 views. Runner-ups are \"Sun\" with 290,000+ views and CO2 with 280,000+ views.\nAs mentioned in an earlier blog post, one month stuck out during 2019 when the view numbers were considerably higher than usual. We are fairly certain that this was caused by the \"global week of climate action\" kicking off on September 20 with a huge global climate strike followed by Greta Thunberg's \"How dare you?\" speech to world leaders on Sept. 23. The spike is clearly visible in the daily views across all rebuttals since January 1, 2019 (click for larger version):\nNot really wanting to overdo the charts in this review post, but one particular spike in rebuttal views is too distinct to not get a special mention, especially as we couldn't trace it back to its source. Anybody have an idea, why the basic version of \"consensus\" got viewed 6,000 times on December 7 (click for larger view)?\nDownloads\nThe Debunking Handbook is still by far the most downloaded of our resources with more than 36,000 downloads of the English version. The various translations got downloaded more than 17,000 times with over 9,000 of those being the German version. Speaking of The Debunking Handbook, we'll soon add translations into Turkish and Persian!\nOther notable downloads include the Guide to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (7,000+) and the Fact-Myth-Fallacy summary (5,500+) with its German version getting downloaded more than 1,200 times in December alone (and the other months together not quite reaching 900).\nTranslations\nOn January 2 we added the Portuguese Translation of The Debunking Handbook thanks to the work of our translation team in Brazil (Claudia Groposo, Luciano Marquetto and Sabrina Leitzke). A Turkish and a Persian translation of The Debunking Handbook is currently getting finalized. On September 20 we made the German translation of The Consensus Handbook - created by Baerbel Winkler, Timo Lubitz and Thomas Traill - available and the Portuguese translation is currently in the works.\nA new team in Israel added or updated 44 rebuttals, making the list of Hebrew translations considerably longer. Our Brazilian team updated or created 18 Portuguese rebuttals, and translators in Russia worked on 10 rebuttals.\nSocial media\nOur Facebook page currently has about 188,000 followers. It provides breaking news and timely information about climate-related matters from around the world. Its format allows readers to comment on and discuss each post, albeit in a more abbreviated form than the comment threads on the SkS website. John Hartz creates the bulk of the FB posts and other members of the SkS team respond to questions submitted by readers on a regular basis.\nOn Twitter we have ca. 21,000 followers, up by more than 2,500 compared to a year ago.\nWe've also set up shop on MeWe, a relatively new social media platform which promises to stay ad- and tracking free. You can find the Skeptical Science MeWe page via this link but need to register an account before you can join the 310+ followers we have \"accumulated\" there since starting the page on January 1.\nCranky Uncle\nAt the time this review is published, the crowdfunding campaign which started on December 4 for the free Cranky Uncle app has hit it's half-way point and thanks to the donations received thus far, at the very least the iPhone/iPad version will become a reality.\nAs we head into 2020 we'd really appreciate your help in order to reach additional stretch goals by February 4. We'd like to make the app as impactful as possible in order to inoculate large parts of the population against the misinformation still making the rounds about human-caused climate change. Wouldn't it be neat to get herd immunity against fake news? If your answer to this question is \"Yes\", please consider supporting the Cranky Uncle Crowdfunding Campaign!\nAnother exciting development heading into 2020 is the publication of the upcoming book Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change by John Cook, to be released on Feb 25, 2020. This is a 176-page book featuring hundreds of cartoons explaining and exposing climate misinformation. If you want a preview of the book, John has been posting a steady supply of cartoons in response to current climate misinformation on his Instagram page...\nThanks for reading and all the best for whatever 2020 has in store for us!"

   "title": "Statistic of the decade: The massive deforestation of the Amazon",
   "paragraph": "Statistic of the decade: The massive deforestation of the Amazon\nPosted on 30 December 2019 by Guest Author\nLiberty Vittert, Professor of the Practice of Data Science, Washington University in St Louis\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.\nThis year, I was on the judging panel for the Royal Statistical Society’s International Statistic of the Decade.\nMuch like Oxford English Dictionary’s “Word of the Year” competition, the international statistic is meant to capture the zeitgeist of this decade. The judging panel accepted nominations from the statistical community and the public at large for a statistic that shines a light on the decade’s most pressing issues.\nOn Dec. 23, we announced the winner: the 8.4 million soccer fields of land deforested in the Amazon over the past decade. That’s 24,000 square miles, or about 10.3 million American football fields.\nThis statistic, while giving only a snapshot of the issue, provides insight into the dramatic change to this landscape over the last 10 years. Since 2010, mile upon mile of rainforest has been replaced with a wide range of commercial developments, including cattle ranching, logging and the palm oil industry.\nThis calculation by the committee is based on deforestation monitoring results from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, as well as FIFA’s regulations on soccer pitch dimensions.\nCalculating the cost\nThere are a number of reasons why this deforestation matters – financial, environmental and social.\nFirst of all, 20 million to 30 million people live in the Amazon rainforest and depend on it for survival. It’s also the home to thousands of species of plants and animals, many at risk of extinction.\nSecond, one-fifth of the world’s fresh water is in the Amazon Basin, supplying water to the world by releasing water vapor into the atmosphere that can travel thousands of miles. But unprecedented droughts have plagued Brazil this decade, attributed to the deforestation of the Amazon.\nDuring the droughts, in Sao Paulo state, some farmers say they lost over one-third of their crops due to the water shortage. The government promised the coffee industry almost US$300 million to help with their losses.\nFinally, the Amazon rainforest is responsible for storing over 180 billion tons of carbon alone. When trees are cleared or burned, that carbon is released back into the atmosphere. Studies show that the social cost of carbon emissions is about $417 per ton.\nFinally, as a November 2018 study shows, the Amazon could generate over $8 billion each year if just left alone, from sustainable industries including nut farming and rubber, as well as the environmental effects.\nFinancial gain?\nSome might argue that there has been a financial gain from deforestation and that it really isn’t a bad thing. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, went so far as to say that saving the Amazon is an impediment to economic growth and that “where there is indigenous land, there is wealth underneath it.”\nIn an effort to be just as thoughtful in that sense, let’s take a look. Assume each acre of rainforest converted into farmland is worth about $1,000, which is about what U.S. farmers have paid to buy productive farmland in Brazil. Then, over the past decade, that farmland amounts to about $1 billion.\nThe deforested land mainly contributes to cattle raising for slaughter and sale. There are a little over 200 million cattle in Brazil. Assuming the two cows per acre, the extra land means a gain of about $20 billion for Brazil.\nChump change compared to the economic loss from deforestation. The farmers, commercial interest groups and others looking for cheap land all have a clear vested interest in deforestation going ahead, but any possible short-term gain is clearly outweighed by long-term loss.\nRebounding\nRight now, every minute, over three football fields of Amazon rainforest are being lost.\nWhat if someone wanted to replant the lost rainforest? Many charity organizations are raising money to do just that.\nAt the cost of over $2,000 per acre – and that is the cheapest I could find – it isn’t cheap, totaling over $30 billion to replace what the Amazon lost this decade.\nStill, the studies that I’ve seen and my calculations suggest that trillions have been lost due to deforestation over the past decade alone."

(Photo: USAFRICOM/Flickr\nAs 2019 draws to a close, the rift between the climate vanguard and the laggards has never been so wide.\nPublic pressure for faster and deeper emissions cuts has peaked this year and a growing alliance of countries, regions, cities and businesses are pushing for more ambitious climate action.\nAcross the world, the reality of climate impacts has grown ever starker. But support to help the most vulnerable cope is lacking. Meanwhile, scientists continue to warn of a narrowing window of time to act.\nEntrenched nationalism continues to threaten the multilateral order which underpins the Paris Agreement and a global commitment to limit warming “well below 2C”.\nDonald Trump has officially started to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement and Jair Bolsonaro is working to open up the Amazon to large agribusiness interests. Other emerging economies such as China and India are seemingly hiding behind the US retreat to delay bolder action.\nThroughout 2019, Climate Home News has continued to report on the science, the people and the big diplomatic players shaping the commitments and disagreements taking the world into the future.

Shouting into the wind? Well, after a decade of rising pollution, failed politics and worsening disasters, it seems the many, many of us who care about the climate crisis increasingly are shouting into the hurricane, if not the apocalypse.\nOn the cusp of 2020, the state of the planet is far more dire than in 2010. Preserving a safe and healthy ecological system is no longer a realistic possibility. Now, we're looking at less bad options, ceding the fact that the virtual end of coral reefs, the drowning of some island nations, the worsening of already-devastating storms and the displacement of millions — they seem close to inevitable. The climate crisis is already costly, deadly and deeply unjust, putting the most vulnerable people in the world, often who've done the least to cause this, at terrible risk.\nThe worst part? We've known about this for a very long time. The climate emergency may seem like the issue of the moment, a new thing, a 2020 Democrats thing or a Greta Thunberg thing, but check out this 1958 educational film that mentions \"tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami;\" or coverage of the first Earth Day in 1970, 50 years ago this coming April, when millions hit the streets; or NASA scientist James Hansen's 1988 testimony before the US Senate stating the era of global warming had begun.\nIt bears repeating that scientists have looked at the evidence, and more than 97% of them agree that humans are warming the planet, primarily by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The warnings from scientists are only getting more dire as we peel decades off the calendar.\n\"The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,\" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said earlier this month. \"It is in sight and is hurtling towards us.\"\nThere's a bright spot in all of this, and I will get to that.\nBut first I think we must take a clear-eyed, cold assessment of 2020.\nShouting into the apocalypse: The decade in climate change, Opinion by John D Sutter, CNN, Dec 26, 2019\nEditors Note: John D.

   "title": "The never-ending RCP8.5 debate",
   "paragraph": "The never-ending RCP8.5 debate\nPosted on 27 December 2019 by , ATTP\nThis is a re-post from ATTP\nI think my New Year’s resolution is going to be to not talk about RCP8.5. However, I think I will briefly summarise the state of the never-ending debate. I thought we’d reached a bit of a breakthough when Zeke Hausfather and Justin Ritchie posted an article suggesting that [a] 3C world is now “Business as Usual”, but it seems to have degenerated once more. David Wallace-Wells also has a follow up article pointing out that our climate future doesn’t look as bad as it once looked. If you’re interested, Pietro Monticone has a summary of the state of the debate.\nThe basic idea is that current emission projections (from the International Energy Agency) suggest that emissions won’t rise much between now and 2040. If you then make some reasonable assumptions and project these to 2100, you find that we will probably follow something close to an RCP6 pathway which will probably lead to warming of between 1.9oC and 4.4oC, with a best estimate of around 3oC. In other words, current policy suggests that business-as-usual is closer to RCP6, than to RCP8.5 (which has often been regarded as a business-as-usual pathway).\nSo, the basic message seems to be that we’re heading towards a world where the climate impacts might not be as apocalyptic as they could have been. Good news, in some sense. However, there are a great many uncertainties associated with these projections. Even though we may be heading towards a 3oC world, we can’t rule out that we’ll still end up in a >4oC world.\nThis is where I have some problems. Some are interpreting this as suggesting that we’ve essentially limited warming to ~3oC, which completely ignores all the uncertainties associated with these projections. Similarly, some are arguing that we should pay no attention to studies that use RCP8.5, which completely ignores that we still can’t rule out levels of warming typically associated with RCP8.5 (>4oC, for example). From a climate modelling perspective, RCP8.5 is simply a concentration/forcing pathway. Even if it’s now higher than is likely along business-as-usual pathway, it is still a useful pathway for investigating the higher levels of warming that are still possible.\nI think it is good that we may have ruled out some of the worst case impacts, but we’re still potentially heading for a world that has warmed by more than 3oC (potentially even 4o – 5oC). Also, despite the confidence of some energy analysts, we have still yet to peak global emissions. A number of quite high-profile climate scientists (Richard Betts and Ken Caldeira) are still pointing out that given the uncertainties associated with socio-economic projections, and potential carbon cycle feedbacks, we really can’t yet completely rule out an RCP8.5 concentration pathway.\nI do think it’s become very unlikely that we will follow such a high concentration pathway, but I also think that this current narrative has been poorly framed, and that some will use it to argue that we don’t really need to do much more about climate change. I do worry that in 10 years time we’ll be having a similar discussion – “yes, emissions may have continued rising through the 2020s, but – trust us – they’re just about to peak”. I hope I’m wrong.\nLinks:\nA 3C world is now “Business as Usual” – Breakthrough Institute article by Zeke Hausfather and Justin Ritchie.\nWe’re Getting a Clearer Picture of the Climate Future — and It’s Not as Bad as It Once Looked – Article by David Wallace Wells.\nRCP8.5 issues & comments – summary by Pietro Monticone."

   "title": "The five corrupt pillars of climate change denial",
   "paragraph": "The five corrupt pillars of climate change denial\nPosted on 24 December 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from The Conversation by Mark Maslin, Professor of Earth System Science, UCL\nThe fossil fuel industry, political lobbyists, media moguls and individuals have spent the past 30 years sowing doubt about the reality of climate change - where none exists. The latest estimate is that the world’s five largest publicly-owned oil and gas companies spend about US$200 million a year on lobbying to control, delay or block binding climate policy.\nTheir hold on the public seems to be waning. Two recent polls suggested over 75% of Americans think humans are causing climate change. School climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion protests, national governments declaring a climate emergency, improved media coverage of climate change and an increasing number of extreme weather events have all contributed to this shift. There also seems to be a renewed optimism that we can deal with the crisis.\nBut this means lobbying has changed, now employing more subtle and more vicious approaches – what has been termed as “climate sadism”. It is used to mock young people going on climate protests and to ridicule Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old young woman with Asperger’s, who is simply telling the scientific truth.\nAnti-climate change lobbying spend by the five largest publicly-owned fossil fuel companies. Statista, CC BY-SA\nAt such a crossroads, it is important to be able to identify the different types of denial. The below taxonomy will help you spot the different ways that are being used to convince you to delay action on climate change.\n1. Science denial\nThis is the type of denial we are all familiar with: that the science of climate change is not settled. Deniers suggest climate change is just part of the natural cycle. Or that climate models are unreliable and too sensitive to carbon dioxide.\nSome even suggest that CO₂ is such a small part of the atmosphere it cannot have a large heating affect. Or that climate scientists are fixing the data to show the climate is changing (a global conspiracy that would take thousands of scientists in more than a 100 countries to pull off).\nAll these arguments are false and there is a clear consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change. The climate models that predict global temperature rises have remained very similar over the last 30 years despite the huge increase in complexity, showing it is a robust outcome of the science.\nRead more: Five climate change science misconceptions – debunked\nModel reconstruction of global temperature since 1970. Average of the models in black with model range in grey compared to observational temperature records from NASA, NOAA, HadCRUT, Cowtan and Way, and Berkeley Earth. Carbon Brief, CC BY\nThe shift in public opinion means that undermining the science will increasingly have little or no effect. So climate change deniers are switching to new tactics. One of Britain’s leading deniers, Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor, now agrees that humans are causing climate change, despite having founded the sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation in 2009.\nIt says it is “open-minded on the contested science of global warming, [but] is deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated”. In other words, climate change is now about the cost not the science.\n2. Economic denial\nThe idea that climate change is too expensive to fix is a more subtle form of climate denial. Economists, however, suggest we could fix climate change now by spending 1% of world GDP. Perhaps even less if the cost savings from improved human health and expansion of the global green economy are taken into account. But if we don’t act now, by 2050 it could cost over 20% of world GDP.\nWe should also remember that in 2018 the world generated US$86,000,000,000,000 and every year this World GDP grows by 3.5%. So setting aside just 1% to deal with climate change would make little overall difference and would save the world a huge amount of money. What the climate change deniers also forget to tell you is that they are protecting a fossil fuel industry that receives US$5.2 trillion in annual subsidies – which includes subsidised supply costs, tax breaks and environmental costs. This amounts to 6% of world GDP.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that efficient fossil fuel pricing would lower global carbon emissions by 28%, fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46%, and increase government revenue by 3.8% of the country’s GDP.\n3. Humanitarian denial\nClimate change deniers also argue that climate change is good for us. They suggest longer, warmer summers in the temperate zone will make farming more productive. These gains, however, are often offset by the drier summers and increased frequency of heatwaves in those same areas. For example, the 2010 “Moscow” heatwave killed 11,000 people, devastated the Russian wheat harvest and increased global food prices.\nGeographical zones of the world. The tropical zones span from the Tropic of Cancer in the North to the Tropic of Capricorn in the South (red shaded region) and contains 40% of the World population. Maulucioni/Wikipedia, CC BY-SA\nMore than 40% of the world’s population also lives in the Tropics – where from both a human health prospective and an increase in desertification no one wants summer temperatures to rise.\nDeniers also point out that plants need atmospheric carbon dioxide to grow so having more of it acts like a fertiliser. This is indeed true and the land biosphere has been absorbing about a quarter of our carbon dioxide pollution every year. Another quarter of our emissions is absorbed by the oceans. But losing massive areas of natural vegetation through deforestation and changes in land use completely nullifies this minor fertilisation effect.\nClimate change deniers will tell you that more people die of the cold than heat, so warmer winters will be a good thing. This is deeply misleading. Vulnerable people die of the cold because of poor housing and not being able to afford to heat their homes. Society, not climate, kills them.\nThis argument is also factually incorrect. In the US, for example, heat-related deaths are four times higher than cold-related ones. This may even be an underestimate as many heat-related deaths are recorded by cause of death such as heart failure, stroke, or respiratory failure, all of which are exacerbated by excessive heat.\nUS weather fatalities for 2018 alongside the ten- and 30-year average. National Weather Service, CC BY\n4. Political denial\nClimate change deniers argue we cannot take action because other countries are not taking action. But not all countries are equally guilty of causing current climate change. For example, 25% of the human-produced CO₂ in the atmosphere is generated by the US, another 22% is produced by the EU. Africa produces just under 5%.\nGiven the historic legacy of greenhouse gas pollution, developed countries have an ethical responsibility to lead the way in cutting emissions. But ultimately, all countries need to act because if we want to minimise the effects of climate change then the world must go carbon zero by 2050.\nPer capita annual carbon dioxide emissions and cumulative country emissions. Data from the Global Carbon Project. Nature. Data from the Global Carbon Project\nDeniers will also tell you that there are problems to fix closer to home without bothering with global issues. But many of the solutions to climate change are win-win and will improve the lives of normal people. Switching to renewable energy and electric vehicles, for example, reduces air pollution, which improves people’s overall health.\nDeveloping a green economy provides economic benefits and creates jobs. Improving the environment and reforestation provides protection from extreme weather events and can in turn improve food and water security.\n5. Crisis denial\nThe final piece of climate change denial is the argument that we should not rush into changing things, especially given the uncertainty raised by the other four areas of denial above. Deniers argue that climate change is not as bad as scientists make out. We will be much richer in the future and better able to fix climate change. They also play on our emotions as many of us don’t like change and can feel we are living in the best of times – especially if we are richer or in power.\nBut similarly hollow arguments were used in the past to delay ending slavery, granting the vote to women, ending colonial rule, ending segregation, decriminalising homosexuality, bolstering worker’s rights and environmental regulations, allowing same sex marriages and banning smoking.\nThe fundamental question is why are we allowing the people with the most privilege and power to convince us to delay saving our planet from climate change?"

   "title": "The high and low points for climate change in 2019",
   "paragraph": "The high and low points for climate change in 2019\nPosted on 23 December 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Bud Ward\nPicture it this way just for fun: Three scientists walk into a bar.\nThey join a few more, early arrivals, and soon after are joined by yet a few more; like them, perhaps, taking a respite from the intensity of consecutive long days of highly technical PowerPoint presentations at an annual year-end mega-conference.\nThe casual talk soon turns to their views of 2019’s most ENcouraging and most DIScouraging developments in their field. (Part II explores scientists’ and crystal ball visions of the coming new year’s major developments – hoped-for, feared, or just expected best they can see down the road.)\nActually, of course, that’s not at all how it happened in what follows, not even close. Instead, those quoted below, each invited by the author, responded to an email seeking their views of high and low points of the year just ending, and their outlooks for the year just about to start.\nBright spots in an otherwise dim 2019 climate year\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the youth movements – personified by, but not limited to, Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, Time magazine’s 2019 “Person of the Year” – get several mentions, kudos.\nThunberg’s “Fridays for Future” international movement “changed the conversation in useful ways,” said Jeff Severinghaus, PhD, of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego. “Instead of half-hearted national ambitions, the focus is now on the spectacular failure of today’s adults to solve a problem that will primarily impact the future of today’s children.\nYouth movement highlights ‘spectacular failure of today’s adults to solve a problem’ primarily affecting children’s futures.\n“It highlights the moral dimension of the climate problem,” according to Severinghaus, a member of the National Academy of Sciences: “One group harming another by abdication of responsibility is widely considered to be immoral.”\nMaureen Raymo, PhD, of Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, along with Alan Robock, PhD., of Rutgers University and National Academy of Sciences member Peter H. Gleick, PhD, president-emeritus of the Pacific Institute in Oakland, California, also single out Thunberg and youth activism for praise. Raymo wrote that she is “heartened by the rapidly expanding engagement of youth and young adults in the climate movement. They appreciate that it is their future at stake.”\nGoing beyond the youths’ activities, Don Wuebbles, PhD, University of Illinois, said he finds particularly encouraging “the new science and technology developments being discussed that may help greatly reduce future greenhouse gas emissions.” He singled out developments in solar energy “in and of itself, and also the potential to use solar energy for high-temperature industrial applications.”\nKatharine Hayhoe, PhD, of Texas Tech, said that, looking beyond the U.S., she is very encouraged by real-world, large-scale, system-wide actions that are being taken by countries around the world. For example:\nCanada (my home) has a federal price on carbon and re-elected the party that introduced it (as compared to Australia where they were voted out and the carbon tax was flushed down the toilet).\nThe United Kingdom has (at least temporarily) imposed a moratorium on fracking.\nFinland is phasing out coal and it will be banned by 2029.\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund is divesting from companies dedicated to oil and gas exploration.\nIreland became the first country in the world to divest from fossil fuels entirely (they voted on it in 2018 but I am counting it for this year since it takes a while to accomplish!).\nNew Zealand has committed to being carbon neutral by 2050, and Scotland by 2045. Additionally, nearly 70% of Scotland’s electricity is already green.\nHayhoe said she is encouraged by “the increasing awareness of the climate crisis and its coverage by the media,” and she pointed to youth protests, major IPCC and National Climate Assessment reports, and “the Trump Administration’s rejection of the science and rollback of environmental protections.” She also said public awareness of climate change implications has been driven by “the increasingly severe events we have been experiencing as a result of climate change loading the natural weather dice against us.”\nSocial scientist and international relations expert David Victor, PhD, of UCSD and Scripps, said he finds satisfaction in 2019 from “the expansion of carbon neutrality goals across more of the U.S. states.” And Andrew Dessler, PhD, of Texas A&M University, pointed to “the continued reduction in the price of renewables” as especially encouraging. “This alone might keep us below the RCP4.5 trajectory,”* Dessler wrote. “That’s good news!”\nFinding yet more “good news,” Gleick pointed to “serious efforts by some Democratic presidential candidates to develop real climate plans.”\nA flood of bad news from the year now ending\nAll that is not to put too rosy a picture on a year that also had abundant disappointments on climate change issues.\nTurning to that side of the ledger, Wuebbles singled out as “most discouraging” the lack of progress on policy issues by the U.S. “and around the world.” Agreeing, Severinghaus decried “the current U.S. administration’s rollback of dozens of Obama-era positive climate mitigation” initiatives. “And the increasing use of disinformation on many fronts to weaken our democracy, and push the U.S. toward becoming a petroleum autocracy like Russia or Saudi Arabia.”\nBad news: a close second is ‘hollowing-out of government’s ability to use science to make decisions.’\nLack of federal action in the U.S. is “obviously” a major disappointment in looking at 2019, according to Dessler. “A close second is the continued hollowing-out of the U.S. federal government’s ability to use science to make decisions.” He said he fears many senior federal scientists are being driven to leave civil service and added: “This will make it easier for politicians to make decisions that go against science and satisfy narrow constituencies rather than society as a whole. … Don’t expect things to snap back to the way they were before Trump.”\nThose losses of federal scientific expertise come just as “new science is pointing to climate change actually being an even larger issue than we already thought,” according to Wuebbles. He pointed in particular to “more significant severe weather issues and higher climate sensitivity in new models suggesting longer-term impacts.”\n‘So many depressing scientific studies’\n“There ARE no encouraging advances in climate science in my opinion,” said Hayhoe. “just more bad news, punctuated by the occasional not-so-bad news.”\n“It is truly hard to choose among so many depressing new scientific studies, so I would say in general: the trend towards recognizing that, increasingly and in many (but not all) ways, the scientific consensus has under-estimated the rate, magnitude, and/or extent of climate impacts on both human systems and the natural environment,” Hayhoe said. “This is not new – we’ve been seeing this for a number of years already – but there were a number of studies this year that continued to reinforce this discouraging trend.”\n“Also discouraging,” she said, “is the fact that our carbon emissions continue to rise, globally, despite so many efforts that are being made to reduce them.”\nVictor characterized as discouraging the U.S.’s formal notice of withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. But he cautioned that “it is easy to overstate that” because he expects the U.S. will rejoin “when Trump is gone.”\nAn enduring concern, Victor said, is that “actions on Paris undermine U.S. credibility, and the damage from that will be lasting – as they will from our actions in Syria and many other places.”\nIn addition, Victor cautioned that “the ongoing (often petty) expansion of the trade war with China will amplify the damage to the U.S.-China relationship. That relationship is fraught with challenges that go far beyond the Trump administration, but it is impossible to get serious about climate without a serious engagement with China.”\nKatharine Hayhoe’s concerns that our fears ‘could doom us’\nWhat is it that makes Hayhoe “profoundly discouraged” right now? Hayhoe, seen as one of the nation’s most effective climate science communicators, spelled it out this way:\n“I am profoundly discouraged by how quickly this [increased popular awareness of climate change] turns into fear, and fear turns into judgment, and judgment turns into circling the wagons and attacking each other.\n“Climate fear is turning into a new religion (because what is religion other than a set of behavioral rules we obey because we believe they will make us right in our own eyes, and perhaps those of others and/or a god?) with a brand-new set of 10 commandments: Thou shalt not eat meat or animal products, thou shalt not fly, thou shalt not use any mechanized transportation, thou shalt not have a child – that we then use to persecute any we perceive to be heretics with the zeal of the Spanish Inquisition.\n“If there is any trend I am most discouraged by this past year, it is this. I used to fear that apathy could doom us – now, I fear that it is our fear that will.”\n*Editor’s note: RCP4.5 is an IPCC scenario in which average global surface temperatures would rise about 3 degrees C (about 4.8 degrees F) by 2100."

Talks\nEmpty chairs of the delegations are pictured during the U.N. Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, on Dec. 13, 2019. Photo: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images\nLAST WEDNESDAY, over 300 demonstrators at COP25 in Madrid — this year’s 14-day U.N. climate talks, the group’s longest ever — watched from the courtyard of a conference center as a metal wall rose up seemingly out of nowhere, locking civil society observers literally out in the cold. Moments earlier, some had had their entry badges snatched off them by U.N. guards in skirmishes outside the main plenary hall before they were cordoned off. Security prevented them from speaking even to the press; all civil society observers had been barred from entering the conference center. With access to the venue now blocked, protesters marched out the back entrance, where they were greeted by Spanish police.\nThe protest was intended to call out the widespread lack of ambition coming from some of the world’s biggest emitters of heat-trapping greenhouse gasses, calling on countries in the “global north” to provide support for climate mitigation, adaptation, and recovery, plus excise loopholes that would give polluters a way out to keep on with business as usual. Demonstrators’ credentials were restored a few hours later, but the talks had done little to address their concerns. By Saturday afternoon — two days after talks were set to end — there was little agreement as to what would come out of them. “There is no one issue that is completely resolved,” Harjeet Singh, who leads up global climate work for ActionAid, told me. By the end of the closing plenary the next day, most major issues had been punted to future meetings. Even U.N. Secretary General António Guterres expressed his dissatisfaction on Twitter.\n“There is no doubt: rich countries have been blocking progress across the board,” Singh said.\nRich Nations, After Driving Climate Disaster, Block All Progress At U.N.

   "title": "Scientists plan year locked in ice to unlock Arctic climate change data",
   "paragraph": "Scientists plan year locked in ice to unlock Arctic climate change data\nPosted on 19 December 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Kristen Pope\nMore than 300 scientists from 19 nations are engaged in planned two- to three-month stints locked in polar ice on the German icebreaker RV Polarstern. Over the winter, researchers face constant darkness, frigid temperatures plunging to -45 degrees Celsius, and the threat of hungry polar bears near their research camps.\nWith humanity in desperate need of data about the drastic, dangerous, yet mysterious changes that global warming is wreaking at the top of the world, the ship will lock itself in Arctic sea ice for a full year to facilitate the MOSAiC project (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate).\n“We’re in a new Arctic, and we don’t understand how things work in this new Arctic, so that’s one of the things that’s most exciting, and that’s the overarching science question of MOSAiC: What are the causes and consequences of an ice-diminished Arctic Ocean?” says Donald Perovich, professor at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth and co-lead of the MOSAiC sea ice team. “And I think trying to answer that question for me is the most exciting part of MOSAiC. The Arctic is a lot different than when I started doing this.”\nPerovich saw Arctic sea ice for the first time in 1979 when he was a 28-year-old researcher. It was right around the time satellites started tracking sea ice. The minimum Arctic sea ice extent recorded in 1979 was 2.7 million square miles – a number that plunged to 1.32 million square miles in 2012, a sign of drastic melting.\n“The ice extent has changed,” Perovich says. “There’s less, particularly in the summer, and a very basic property of the ice has changed. There used to be more older, thicker ice, and when I talk about sea ice, old is like four or five years old.” Perovich explains that ice changes as it ages, becoming thicker and more robust over time. “That really old ice has decreased greatly in the 40 years since I’ve been working on the ice to where now it is just a few percent of the ice cover, and a consequence of that is the ice now is thinner and less robust.”\nThe loss of that ice affects coastal communities that had been protected from fall storms by a buffer of sea ice. That sea ice also protects those communities from coastal erosion. Now, communities are exposed to harsh waves and storms, and some areas are crumbling into the ocean. Perovich also points out that the loss of sea ice makes Arctic oil and gas extraction more accessible and increases the feasibility of northern shipping routes and increased tourism, both of which are likely to impact the area and its ecology.\nMelting sea ice doesn’t just affect those who live in the Arctic. The effects of an ice-diminished Arctic ocean range are global in scale and hinge around a process called Arctic amplification, which throws the jet stream off its normal path and leads to extreme weather events. These altered patterns lead to heat waves, droughts, and extreme wildfires, among other impacts. As sea ice melts, the ocean absorbs more sunlight for an easily explained reason: Dark sea water absorbs more solar energy than light ice does, further increasing temperatures and inducing a cycle that further intensifies the melting.\nAn unprecedented full year on site to ‘see this whole movie’\n“We see that there’s less and less ice, and we first want to understand what’s driving those changes,” Perovich says. He says his research team is particularly interested in learning about how snow behaves, including how wind moves it, how it builds up in winter, and how it melts in summer. He is scheduled to join the fifth leg of the journey, from June to August 2020, a time period closely aligned with another research interest: how sunlight interacts with sea ice and melt.\n“The big opportunity of MOSAiC is to get an annual cycle, to be there for the whole year to see this whole movie,” Perovich says. “There’s a lot of experiments done in the Arctic that are really good, but typically they’re for shorter time periods, months, a couple months in this place, a couple months over here. But here we get to be in an area for a whole year and see how things evolve over time, and we also want to see how they evolve spatially – there’s a lot of variability in the ice cover.”\n“It’s the biggest sea ice experiment that’s ever been done,” Perovich says.\nThe ambitious project aims to study the new Arctic as scientists focus on five main research categories: atmosphere, sea ice, ocean, ecosystem, and biogeochemistry. They will study everything from zooplankton to atmospheric mercury deposition and explore how systems interact.\nMOSAiC isn’t a completely novel idea – scientists have held year-long drift ice experiments in the past. “Drifting Station Alpha” was a 1957-1958 project held in honor of the International Geophysical Year. Then came the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment in the 1970s, and SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean) in 1997-1998.\nChallenge of finding the suitable floe\nIn September 2019, the first group of scientists set sail from Tromsø, Norway, and in early October they confirmed the ice floe where the project would take place: a 2.5 by 3.5 kilometer floe located at 85 degrees north and 137 degrees east. Using specially designed metal anchors, they affixed the ship to the ice, and it will drift with it over the next year.\nSummer ice melt increased the researchers’ challenge of finding a suitable floe. Using satellite images, the team located 16 potential floes, further scouting via icebreaker, helicopter, snowmobile, and on foot. They collected ice core samples and charted ice thickness with electromagnetic sensors and helicopter-based laser scanners before agreeing on a specific floe. It contains an area with fairly stable ice and also has areas with thinner, more unstable ice characteristic of the “new Arctic.”\nIn an October 4 press release, MOSAiC expedition leader Markus Rex from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, said, “It may not be the perfect floe, but it’s the best one in this part of the Arctic and offers better working conditions than we could have expected after a warm Arctic summer.”\nA decade in the making\nFinding the best ice floe to set up camp was only one of many logistical endeavors in the extraordinarily complex project. Spearheaded by the Wegener Institute’s Helmholtz Centre, MOSAiC took around 10 years to plan and is expected to cost more than 140 million Euros, about $155-million.\nChris Polashenski, research geophysicist at Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory at Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, has been working on MOSAiC for nearly a decade. He says the idea first came about when a group of scientists discussing their work realized they shared a data gap: the central Arctic.\nIt is prohibitively expensive for any one project to spend a year collecting data there, so researchers decided to collaborate to find a solution. The scientists began planning a joint international expedition to collect and share data: They spent years holding workshops; planning; sorting out the key questions to address; figuring out funding; and developing a science plan.\n“Some people would complain that it takes a decade to put something like this together, but I actually would say no, that’s how much time it takes to do it right,” says Polashenski, who is to join Leg 4 from from mid-April to late June 2020.\nResearchers ‘all covering for each other …’\nPolashenski has two specific science goals for his work with MOSAiC: studying the thermal conductivity of snow, and analyzing how wind moves ice and how pieces of ice interact. However, in addition to collecting their own data, the scientists will also spend time collecting data for colleagues who are not onboard.\n“We’re all covering for each other,” says Polashenski. “I’ll only be on the boat for 2.5 months, but I need someone to take my samples when I’m not there, and they need me to take their samples when I’m there, and I need to make sure that we both understand each others’ projects.”\nIn addition to working together to make sure all samples are acquired, scientists also coordinate to make sure they have all the equipment they need without too much overlap. “We can also look and see, well, we’ve got 10 people bringing the same thing, and we only need five of those, so we’ll keep the other five in a warehouse in Norway in case we need them later,” Perovich says.\nActually getting people and equipment to the Polarstern is another huge logistical challenge. Depending on the time of year, and state and thickness of the ice, short-field jets, icebreakers, and long-haul helicopters could be used to ferry personnel and supplies on and off the vessel.\nOnce safely on the ice, scientists spend long days – sometimes over 12 hours – collecting measurements and data at stations on the ice while guards keep watch for polar bears. After a day’s work is done, they retreat to the ship for the night. Though there isn’t a lot of personal space, the ship provides warm berths, hot meals, and camaraderie. And unlike conducting field work in tents, researchers don’t have to worry about the ice breaking up under a tent at night or a polar bear approaching their camp while they sleep.\nHoping practice makes perfect: No on-floe ‘dry runs’\nTo prepare for the rigorous fieldwork, participants have attended training sessions ahead of their deployments to the ice. While many MOSAiC researchers are veteran polar scientists, others are graduate students and early-career scientists less experienced with harsh polar conditions, so they wanted to make sure everyone was ready. The researchers also used those opportunities to field test equipment and work out any hiccups ahead of time. Polashenski led a training session in Utqiagvik, Alaska (formerly known as Barrow).\n“[MOSAiC] is a big commitment,” Polashenski says. “You’re going two and one-half months to the central Arctic, and there’s no real way to get home after four days if you don’t like it. We took everyone up to [Utqiagvik] and had them all out on the sea ice and out in the wind and the cold and testing their instruments and seeing what broke and what didn’t in a much lower-stakes environment where we could go back into a heated building at the end of the day, and they could go home in a 737 at the end of the week.”\nDuring the training, Polashenski helped colleagues practice using a variety of equipment and navigating on ice, as GPS is unreliable on drifting floes. He also wanted to get people used to spending all day outside in -30 temperatures, allowing time to fine-tune equipment and clothing selections. The team also focused on troubleshooting a variety of problems they may run into in the field, such as a tipped-over snowmobile. “I want them to not be going up to MOSAiC and encountering something for the first time,” Polashenski says.\nIndividual projects, interests, but ‘the data is the legacy.’\nAfter the field training, scientists are even better prepared to conduct their research and ultimately leave a legacy of data – which they say is the most important part of the project.\n“One of the things about MOSAiC is that we all have our special projects and our interests and you can already get excited about the findings you expect to make and get even more excited about the unexpected things that you’ll encounter,” Perovich says, “and we all realize that the data is the legacy.”\n“We’re creating a data set that hopefully people will be using 20 or 30 years from now, and we put a lot of effort into making sure that we come up with a data set that’s archived with all the data you need to understand the observations we’re going to be making.”"

   "title": "SkS Analogy 21 - Snow on a Hot Tin Roof",
   "paragraph": "SkS Analogy 21 - Snow on a Hot Tin Roof\nPosted on 17 December 2019 by Evan, jg\nWith many feet of snow on our shed roof and with another winter storm approaching, I knew I had to get some of the snow off the roof to prevent its collapse. So, I worked for a couple of days pulling off some of the snow. When I finished there was a thin layer of remaining snow over most of the roof, and the sheet metal at the edge of the roof was exposed, bare metal.\nIn the following days I noticed that the amount of bare metal kept getting bigger and bigger, moving up from the edge of the roof towards the peak of the roof. This did not happen with a nice, uniform layer of snow on the roof, all the way down to the edge. For months the snow had not retreated, but once I exposed the edge of the tin roof, the snow started retreating, exposing the tin roof as the snow line proceeded on its upward march towards the peak of the roof.\nOf course, you know what was happening. White snow reflects most of the sunlight, keeping the snow cool. But when even a sliver of metal roof is cleared of snow, the sunlight hits it, warming it up, because the tin roof absorbs most of the sunlight. Now that the tin is warm, the snow next to the tin melts, causing more tin to be exposed, causing the larger amount of exposed tin to absorb more heat, etc. What started as only a sliver of metal exposed on the edges and a small amount of melting, soon turned into a rapidly increasing fraction of the roof being cleared of snow, accelerating the local warming and the melting of snow. Before long the snow on the shed roof had melted all the way to the peak of the roof and cleared itself off.\nThis phenomenon is called the ice-albedo feedback. “Albedo” is a fancy term that essentially means how white something is. Snow has a high albedo, and blacktop has an albedo near 0. Surfaces with high albedo reflect most of the sunlight, whereas surfaces with low albedo absorb most of the sunlight. The idea of the ice-albedo feedback is that when snow is sitting on top of something that has a low albedo, like the snow on our tin roof or like the ice on top of the Arctic ocean, the dark surface near the ice melts more ice or snow, which exposes more dark surface underneath, which causes more warming, which melts more ice or snow, and so on and so forth until soon a large area of snow or ice is melted. One of the only things that interrupts this process is that at some point the sun sets, allowing the environment to cool. This interrupts the ice-albedo feedback because the sunlight that drives the warming is not available during polar night. In Minnesota the sun rises and sets once a day, but in the Arctic there is a period when the sun sets and does not rise again for many months, just as there is also a period when the sun never sets, allowing the ice-albedo feedback to proceed unchecked for months at a time.\nWhy does this snow-clearing effect not keep our shed roof clear all winter long, and why did this ice-albedo feedback not cause massive ice loss in the Arctic 100 years ago? Sun shining on dark waters or on a shed roof causes heating, but if there are other processes causing more cooling than warming, then the overall system will cool. Ultimately whether ice melts or water freezes depends on the balance of many competing heating and cooling processes. The ice-albedo feedback mechanism simply describes an acceleration once melting has begun. But the overall heat transfer processes must allow melting to begin before the ice-albedo feedback process can accelerate the melting.\nBecause of this ice-albedo feedback mechanism the Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as elsewhere on Earth, because where ice is removed to expose a dark surface underneath, the environment goes from stable cooling to stable heating. This dramatic shift from cooling to heating is much of what is causing the Arctic to rapidly warm. Read here, here, and here.\nThis is a problem partly because the Arctic provides a source of global warming on steroids, and therefore a strong, localized source of intense warming. This extreme Arctic warming is also a problem because maintaining stable weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere requires maintaining reliably cold temperatures in the Arctic. As the Arctic warms faster than elsewhere on Earth, the global circulation patterns are disrupted, affecting the motion of the jet stream. Because the jet stream controls weather systems in the Northern Hemisphere, Arctic warming is at the source of much of the recent disruption of our weather patterns according to the following effects.\nA meandering jet stream allows deep troughs and ridges, allowing some areas to get unusually warm while other areas become unusually cold (see here and here). See “A Sinking Ship Reaches New Heights.”\nA slowing, meandering jet stream is associated with weather patterns persisting for longer periods than they would with a jet stream that blows more strongly and directly in a West-to-East direction. A few hot days can turn into a heat wave, a period of rain can turn into a flood, and a period of dry weather can turn into a drought.\nThe jet stream may shed high-pressure systems that act like blocking highs. This is part of what it believed to have caused SuperStorm Sandy and Hurricane Florence to turn into the East coast of the US rather than assuming a northward trajectory that would have kept them away from the East Coast of the US. Read here and here.\nAlthough the ice-albedo feedback primarily occurs in the Arctic, because of its influence on the jet stream, its effects are felt all over the Earth."

   "paragraph": "COP25: Key outcomes agreed at the UN climate talks in Madrid\nPosted on 16 December 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief\nThis year’s annual UN climate conference, COP25 in Madrid, became the longest on record after it concluded after lunch on Sunday, following more than two weeks of fraught negotiations. It had been scheduled to wrap up on Friday.\nNearly 27,000 delegates arrived in the Spanish capital in early December aiming to finalise the “rulebook” of the Paris Agreement – the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020 – by settling on rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation under “Article 6” of the deal.\nThey also hoped to send a message of intent, signalling to the wider world that the UN climate process remains relevant – and that it recognises the yawning gap between current progress and global goals to limit warming.\nThis disconnect was highlighted by a huge protest march through the heart of the Spanish capital and by the presence of climate activist Greta Thunberg, who arrived from her transatlantic journey by sail just in time to make several high-profile appearances in the COP25 conference halls.\nUltimately, however, the talks were unable to reach consensus in many areas, pushing decisions into next year under “Rule 16” of the UN climate process. Matters including Article 6 and “common timeframes” for climate pledges were all punted into 2020, when countries are also due to raise the ambition of their efforts.\nUN secretary general António Guterres said he was “disappointed” with the results of COP25 and that “the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis.”\nThe meeting was finally gavelled to a close at 1:55pm on Sunday. At nearly 44 hours after its scheduled end of 6pm on Friday, this means COP25 became the latest-ever finish by beating COP17 in Durban, which had finished at 6.22am on the Sunday.\nHere, Carbon Brief provides in-depth analysis of all the key outcomes in Madrid – both inside and outside the COP…\nAround the COP\nNeed for ‘ambition’\nArticle 6\nCounting progress – and lack of progress\nAccounting rules to avoid ‘double-counting’\nCarryover of Kyoto carbon ‘units’ and projects\n‘Share of proceeds’ to fund adaptation\n‘OMGE’ for net climate benefits\nLoss and damage\nCommon timeframes\nFinance\nPeriodic review\nResponse measures\nCommon metrics\nGender action plan\nKoronivia joint work on agriculture\nWhat next?\nAround the COP\nThis year’s COP got off to a difficult start, when Chile’s president Sebastian Piñera announced at the end of October that his country could no longer host the event. Piñera blamed “difficult circumstances”, referring to violent anti-government protests in the capital of Santiago.\nWith barely a month to go, Spain stepped in and agreed to take on the event in Madrid, a considerable task that the German government had said “would not have been logistically possible” at the UNFCCC’s headquarters in Bonn, where the COP was held in 2017.\nNevertheless, Chile retained the presidency, with the event rebranded as “COP25 Chile Madrid”.\nDespite this last-minute venue change, the event proceeded in much the same manner as previous COPs, characterised by drawn-out debates and all-night sessions in which negotiators and then ministers discussed jargon-filled texts.\nAt the start of the meeting, COP25 president and Chilean environment secretary Carolina Schmidt said the conference “must change the course of climate action and ambition”. The UN secretary-general António Guterres, in the first of several interventions, asked attendees: “Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand?”\nAlthough the world’s major emitters were never expected to announce fresh climate pledges at COP25, there was still hope that they might collectively send a strong message of intent for next year. However, talks quickly became bogged down in technical issues, such as the rules for carbon market mechanisms, which have eluded completion for years.\nThere was a growing sense among many attendees of a disconnect between these slow, impenetrable UN processes and the action being demanded by protesters around the world.\nThis was summarised by the executive director of Greenpeace Jennifer Morgan, who told assembled journalists that despite the “fresh momentum” provided by the growing global climate movement, it was yet to penetrate the “halls of power”:\n“In the 25 years that I have been at every COP, I have never seen the gap bigger between the inside and the outside.”\nWhen Greta Thunberg arrived in those halls of power, fresh from a transatlantic voyage by sail, she instantly found herself at the centre of the COP’s media circus.\nAt the end of the first week, the young Swedish activist joined a march through central Madrid that organisers said drew half a million people (although local police offered, without explanation, a far more modest estimate of 15,000).\nIn her final speech at the conference, Thunberg captured the mood when she told those assembled in the main plenary hall that the COP “seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes”. Shortly after her appearance, she was announced as Time Magazine’s “person of the year”.\nLater that day, around 200 climate campaigners and indigenous rights activists – expressing frustration at the lack of progress – were ejected from the venue, following a protest outside the same plenary room where Thunberg had spoken just hours before.\nA common refrain from protesters and observers was the discrepancy between the slow pace of the talks and the urgency suggested by the latest science.\nThe UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) own emissions gap report, released just prior to the COP, showed the stretch 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement is “slipping out of reach”. Even if existing climate pledges – countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs – are met, emissions in 2030 will be 38% higher than required to meet that target, the report concluded.\nThis point was hammered home by a new Global Carbon Project report a few days later, which showed emissions from fossil fuels and industry are expected to continue rising in 2019 and 2020.\nThis apparent disconnect was highlighted further by the language used to describe the latest reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the first of which covered land, and the second oceans and cryosphere.\nBoth of these reports were only “noted”, as opposed to “welcomed”, by the final text, though it also “expressed its appreciation and gratitude” to the scientists behind the work. (At last year’s COP24 summit, the refusal by the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait to language “welcoming” the IPCC 1.5C report was a source of significant tension.)\nThere were moves to raise ambition by some non-state actors at the COP with, for example, 177 companies pledging to cut emissions in line with the 1.5C target as part of the Climate Ambition Alliance. This came after a group of 477 investors, controlling $34tn in assets, called on world leaders to update their NDCs and step up ambition.\nFinally, owing to its original location in Chile – a nation with around 4,000 miles of coastline – the leadership dubbed this year’s event the “blue COP”, laying out its intention to focus on oceans.\nA report released in the first week of the COP by the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, a group of 14 heads of government, brought “a stark reminder of the serious economic consequences of our changing climate for ocean industries”.\nWhile most attention at the COP was focused on the tense negotiations and need to send a clear signal to countries on raising their climate ambition, the president did announce in the second week that 39 countries had committed to including oceans in their future NDCs.\nOne of the final decision texts also requested that a “dialogue” be convened at the next meeting of the UN climate process in Bonn in June 2020 “on the ocean and climate change to consider how to strengthen mitigation and adaptation action”.\nA similar dialogue in June 2020 was requested “on the relationship between land and climate change adaptation related matters”, after Brazil backed away from its objections at the last minute.\nNeed for ‘ambition’\nFrom the outset, Chile made it clear this was to be an “ambition COP”, reflecting the significant gap between current pledges and what would be needed to meet global temperature goals.\nThe hashtag #TimeForAction was emblazoned across the conference centre and the presidency launched a “climate ambition alliance” to accelerate progress towards the Paris goals.\nGuterres emphasised this in his opening address to the conference, telling parties “to step up next year”. He added: “The world’s biggest emitters need to do much more.”\nUnder the Paris Agreement, all parties committed to not only submitting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for cutting emissions, but also to “[re]communicate” or “update” their pledges by the end of 2020.\nFurthermore, successive NDCs must “represent a progression” and “reflect [each country’s] highest possible ambition”. Along with five-yearly “stocktakes” of progress, these regular rounds of new NDCs are at the heart of the Paris “ratchet” mechanism, designed to raise ambition over time.\nHowever, for the majority of NDCs, which already cover the period to 2030, the Paris text does not explicitly require that new pledges be submitted next year – parties may simply “[re]communicate” the same offering they made in 2015 or 2016.\nSue Biniaz, senior fellow for climate change at the UN Foundation and a key architect of the Paris deal in her former role as a senior US negotiator, told a COP25 side event:\n“The reason we threw in ‘recommunicate’ was we didn’t want it to be easy for a country to sit back quietly and maintain its target. We thought, if you had a very unambitious target, it might be more embarrassing if you had to send in a postcard saying ‘I’m sticking to my unambitious target’, than if you just had to say nothing. We’ll see next year whether that actually worked, psychologically.”\nGiven that current NDCs are nowhere near enough to limit warming to 1.5C, there have been efforts at successive COPs to agree text calling for greater ambition from all parties. At COP24 in December 2018, some parties tried, but ultimately failed to insert strong language on raising ambition.\nWith COP25 being the final summit before the clock ticks over into the deadline year of 2020, Madrid was seen by many as a last chance to secure increased ambition. Naoyuki Yamagishi, climate and energy lead for WWF Japan, told Carbon Brief that COP25 was the “last chance, the last call to make the case for raising ambition in 2020”.\nUNFCCC executive secretary Patricia Espinosa reminded delegates that “ambition” was not officially on the agenda for COP25, but that many saw it as essential to send a clear message to the world. In the first week, the Chilean presidency began consultations on a series of texts, which collectively were supposed to convey this message, namely “1/CP.25”, “1/CMA.2” and “1/CMP.15”.\nAt the opening of the high-level political segment of the COP in week two, Teresa Ribera, Spain’s acting minister for the ecological transition, told delegates:\n“Countries will have to announce more ambitious contributions in 2020 – and let me remind you that 2020 begins in exactly 20 days. This is also the year in which we have committed ourselves to announcing long-term cohesive strategies to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.”\nAs it stands, according to the World Resources Institute NDC tracker, just 80 countries – primarily, small and developing nations – have stated their intention to enhance their NDCs by 2020, representing just 10.5% of world emissions. All the biggest emitters are absent from this list.\nAlthough Chile postponed its plans to enhance its NDC at COP25, some promising signs did emerge over the course of the conference, most notably a fresh signal from the European Union.\nOn 12-13 December, EU heads of state met in Brussels and agreed to make the bloc “climate neutral” by 2050. Despite resistance from Poland, which has until next summer to come onboard, the European Commission revealed a “European Green Deal”, which, if it becomes law, will commit at least 25% of the EU’s long-term budget to climate action. Ursula von der Leyen, the new European Commission president, described it as Europe’s “man on the Moon” moment.\nThe deal also includes a proposed timetable for boosting the EU’s NDC target for 2030, from its current aim of cutting emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels, to a higher target of “at least 50% and towards 55%”.\nHowever, there was concern expressed by NGOs at COP25 that this raised pledge must be signed off well in advance of the “crucial” EU-China summit in Leipzig next September. This is because, they argue, there needs to be enough diplomatic time and, hence, leverage to use the improved NDC to persuade the world’s largest polluter to improve its own climate pledge.\nTo stick to this timetable, the new target must undergo a formal impact assessment by the end of the spring next year, say the NGOs. They fear that if that timing slips then there will not be enough time to use the Leipzig meeting to pressure the Chinese to up their offer. With key emitters such as the US, Australia and Brazil displaying hostility towards international climate action, a lot now hangs on China and the EU acting as one to maintain the Paris Agreement’s momentum.\nAnother brief moment of optimism at the COP came when the Danish parliament adopted a new climate law, setting a legally binding target to cut emissions to 70% below 1990 levels by 2030.\nHowever, a general lack of progress with negotiations led to simmering tensions in the COP25 conference centre, with the “ambition text” at the centre of the storm.\nIn part, this tension reflected differing interpretations of the word “ambition”. Many developed countries and vulnerable states viewed “ambition” mainly as a means to increase efforts on cutting emissions after 2020, so as to close the gap to meeting climate goals.\nOthers, particularly India and its partners in the “Like-Minded group of Developing Countries” (LMDCs), argued for a broader interpretation that also covered the promised provision of climate finance, as well as efforts to boost adaptation and build capacity in poorer countries.\nThese countries called for a particular focus on the failure of many developed countries to fulfil their climate pledges in the pre-2020 period, arguing that it was this failure that had left the world so far from meeting its aim of avoiding dangerous warming.\nThe splits on the “ambition” question and a range of other key debates at COP25 are shown in the table, below, with positions colour-coded as priority issues or “red lines”. The grid is based on informal intelligence gathered by Carbon Brief in Madrid, as well as public interventions by negotiating alliances during the talks.

Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP via Getty Images\nClimate talks in Madrid have ended with a partial agreement to ask countries to come up with more ambitious targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris accord.\nFew countries came to this year’s talks with updated plans to reach the Paris goals, though the EU finally agreed its long-term target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Experts say more ambitious emissions cuts are needed globally if the Paris pledge to hold global heating to no more than 2C is to be met.\nThis year’s round of annual UN talks focused on narrow technical issues such as the workings of the global carbon markets, a means by which countries can trade their successes in cutting emissions with other countries that have not cut their own emissions fast enough.\nBy midday on Sunday, more than 40 hours after the talks deadline, agreement on that was still far off and the issue will have to be resolved next year.\nUN climate talks end with limited progress on emissions targets by Fiona Harvey, Environment, Guardian, Dec 15, 2019\nClick here to read the entire article as posted on the Guardian website.\nOpinion of the Week\nThe Party That Ruined the Planet\nRepublican climate denial is even scarier than Trumpism.\nA new federal report finds that climate change in the Arctic is accelerating.

   "paragraph": "In-depth Q&A: How ‘Article 6’ carbon markets could ‘make or break’ the Paris Agreement\nPosted on 12 December 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief\nA little-known and highly technical section of the Paris Agreement could “make or break” the regime – and its aim of avoiding dangerous climate change.\nThese “Article 6” rules, for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation, are the last piece of the Paris regime to be resolved, after the rest of its “rulebook” was agreed in late 2018.\nTo its proponents, Article 6 offers a path to significantly raising climate ambition or lowering costs, while engaging the private sector and spreading finance, technology and expertise into new areas.\nTo its critics, it risks fatally undermining the ambition of the Paris Agreement at a time when there is clear evidence of the need to go further and faster to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\nIf the Article 6 rulebook is to be agreed, a set of interlocking, overlapping and conflicting national priorities – a veritable “four-dimensional spaghetti” of red lines – will have to be traded off at the December COP25 UN climate talks in Madrid, or, failing that, at COP26 in Glasgow in 2020.\nThis is a classic example of the horse-trading that characterises international negotiations. But the stakes are high ahead of the crunch 2020 talks, where countries are due to raise their currently inadequate ambition towards the 1.5C and “well-below 2C” twin goals of the Paris Agreement.\nIn this in-depth Q&A, Carbon Brief breaks down the Article 6 text, explaining the key points of contention and how they might be resolved.\nWhat is article 6 of the Paris Agreement?\nWhat exactly does Article 6 Say?\nWhy is Article 6 so important?\nWhy has this issue proved so contentious?\nWhat are Article 6’s key issues?\n‘Overall Mitigation in Global Emissions’ (OMGE)\n‘Double-counting’ and ‘corresponding adjustments’\nAccounting for trade between NDCs with single or multi-year targets\nEmissions reductions ‘inside’ vs ‘outside’ the scope of host NDCs\n‘Transition’ of Kyoto-era projects, methods and carbon credits\nThe ‘share of proceeds’ from trading that will be set aside for adaptation\nWhat happens next with Article 6?\nWhat is Article 6 of the Paris Agreement?\nOn 1 January 2020, a new international climate regime will take effect under the 2015 Paris Agreement, according to detailed rules agreed at the COP24 climate summit in December 2018.\nBut one piece of that regime is unresolved, having proved so contentious that countries have been unable to agree the rules governing its use. This is Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, covering a single side of A4 and containing just nine densely worded paragraphs (6.1 through 6.9).\nThis short text contains three separate mechanisms for “voluntary cooperation” towards climate goals: two based on markets and a third based on “non-market approaches”. The text outlines requirements for those taking part, but leaves the details – the Article 6 “rulebook” – undecided.\nIn simple terms, the first mechanism would allow a country that has beaten its Paris climate pledge to sell any overachievement to a nation that has fallen short against its own goals. This overachievement could be in terms of emissions cuts, but might also cover other types of target. For example, some countries have set goals for renewable energy capacity or forest expansion.\nThe second mechanism would create a new international carbon market, governed by a UN body, for the trading of emissions reductions created anywhere in the world by the public or private sector. Carbon credits could, for example, be generated by a new renewable power plant, an emissions-saving factory upgrade or the restoration of an area of forest.\n(It remains undecided whether to include projects reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, known as “REDD”, within the Article 6 scheme.)\nThis new market is sometimes referred to as the “Sustainable Development Mechanism” (SDM). It would replace the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which operated under the predecessor to the Paris Agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which gave developed countries legally-binding emissions targets that applied from the start of 2008 until 2012.\n(Targets for a second commitment period, running until the end of 2020, were adopted in the “Doha Amendment”, but this has yet to enter force. EU states have pledged to meet it anyway.)\nThe final Article 6 mechanism for “non-market approaches” is less well defined, but would provide a formal framework for climate cooperation between countries, where no trade is involved, such as development aid.\nThis could include similar activities to those under the other mechanisms – support for a new windfarm, for example – but without any buying and selling of the resulting CO2 savings.\nThe three separate mechanisms – under Article 6.2, 6.4 and 6.8 – all became part of the Paris deal in recognition of the different interests and priorities among parties to the agreement. These differences remain and must be traded off once again, if the Article 6 rulebook is to be agreed.\nIn order to finalise the rulebook, negotiators must navigate a thicket of impenetrable jargon, a series of technical accounting challenges and bear-traps of “constructive ambiguity” in the text, that hide often incompatible visions of how Article 6 should work and what it was created for in the first place.\nThe negotiations are also embedded in the decades-long political context of the UN climate talks, subject to all its usual battlegrounds over ambition, finance, support for vulnerable nations and the extent to which climate action should be nationally versus internationally determined.\nThe challenge this represents is clear from the fact that Article 6 was the only part of the Paris rulebook that could not be agreed at COP24 in December 2018.\nWhereas draft negotiating texts for each other part of the rulebook were progressively whittled down during that two-week meeting, the sections on Article 6 remained stuck, with 132 unresolved sections of text contained in “square brackets”, shown in the chart below in red.\nNumber of square brackets, indicating areas of disagreement, in successive drafts of the Paris Agreement “rulebook”, broken down by the relevant article of the deal. Apart from Article 6 carbon markets, shown in red, all sections reached zero brackets and were agreed by the end of COP24 on 15 December 2018.

As things stand, the draft rulebook texts on Article 6.2, Article 6.4 and Article 6.8 cover 41 pages, containing 672 square brackets.\nThe increased number of unresolved areas in the text after the Bonn meeting reflects a retrenchment, with many countries and negotiating blocs at the talks retreating to their starting positions having previously given way in a spirit of compromise at COP24.\nThis retrenchment means that issues and red lines can once again be traded off against each other as negotiators work towards agreement across the Article 6 rulebook. There could also be attempts to tie these talks to other political priorities at the COP, further complicating matters.\nKelley Kizzier, now associate vice president for international climate at US NGO the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), was co-chair of the Article 6 negotiations at COP24. She tells Carbon Brief:\n“The reason we got as far as we did in Katowice is that people were expecting a deal. Those compromises were made in the context of a deal, so when a deal doesn’t materialise, of course, people back off from their compromises.”\nDespite this setback, Kizzier says that “the heart of a deal on Article 6 is still there on the table”. She adds: “There are some crux issues that still need to be resolved, but once those are agreed the text could come together very quickly.”\nWhat exactly does Article 6 say?\nAt the international climate summit at COP25 in Madrid, in December 2019, climate negotiators will try once again to finalise the Article 6 “rulebook”, which will govern voluntary international cooperation on climate change, including carbon markets.\nTo truly understand the task they face and the key areas of remaining disagreement, the first port of call is the text of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement itself, shown in annotated form in the graphic, below.\nClick here to read the rest"

To all those who've already contributed, a massive Thank You!\nGreenland mass balance refined by IMBIE\nThe IMBIE team have published a new analysis, Mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2018. This improved, more comprehensive study finds loss of ice from Greenland at the upper end of IPCC assumptions. The loss is due to subaerial surface melting and and warmer waters touching certain parts of the periphery of Greenland, in particular the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbræ. The implication is routine flooding or loss of living space for another 40 million or so persons by the end of this century, up to ~400 million from the previously estimated 360 million.

Jenkins et al take a look at spent nuclear fuel repositories in the United States in Unmanaged climate risks to spent fuel from U.S. nuclear power plants: The case of sea-level rise. As with the rest of such investigations into warming knock-on effects, this paper helps to illustrate future costs being imposed on us by politicians thwarting construction of perspicacious policy while expediently posing as climate science deniers. It would be better if these artistes dropped their acts and spoke as adult-adult to their constituencies. From the abstract:\nA geospatial analysis of coastal sites shows that with six feet of sea-level rise, seven spent fuel sites will be juxtaposed by seawater. Of those, three will be near or completely surrounded by water, and should be considered a priority for mitigation: Humboldt Bay (California), Turkey Point (Florida), and Crystal River (Florida). To ensure policy-makers manage such climate risks, a risk management approach is proposed. Further, we recommend that policy-makers 1) transfer overdue spent fuel from cooling pools to dry casks, particularly where located in high risk sites; 2) develop a long-term and comprehensive storage plan that is less vulnerable to climate change; and 3) encourage international nuclear treaties and standards to take climate change into account.\nHousekeeping\nFor people without academic or other rare library privileges it's quite annoying to be intrigued by an article link here and then be thwarted by a publisher fee.

   "title": "What would Bill Ruckelshaus do?",
   "paragraph": "What would Bill Ruckelshaus do?\nPosted on 9 December 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Bud Ward\nWhat exactly would Bill Ruckelshaus do?\nIt’s a question every EPA Administrator since him, and perhaps every serious environmental professional, should be asking.\nThe first and twice-serving EPA administrator, now deceased at age 87, would make few lists of most influential climate change savants. Would that he had been in his prime, and in office, during the rise of that issue as the seminal and existential environmental issue of our lifetimes.\nIn Memory\nSo it is, in fact, impossible to know, just what exactly the formidable “Ruck” would have done.\nBut some things he would do would differ not a twit from what he did during his two times serving at EPA, both in Republican administrations, first that of Richard Nixon and then that of Ronald Reagan. We know, for instance, that he would adhere to his binding allegiance to the rule of law. We know too that he would not forsake his strong commitment to the principles of sound and responsible science, whether its findings reinforced or shattered his own personal convictions. Or those of anyone else, including the president he served.\nSpeak even fleetingly to any of those whose environmental career paths crossed that of William Doyle Ruckelshaus: the term “giant” often arises. Not only for his time as EPA’s first administrator, in the 70s, when he brought forth essential restrictions on DDT, pressures on localities to clean up contaminated water supplies, and groundbreaking introductions of motor vehicle emission standards, controls on lead in gasoline, and the introduction of catalytic converters on our cars.\nAnd not solely either for his second curtain call as EPA administrator, under President Reagan, when he returned to the scandal-scarred, battered, and downtrodden agency. He returned to EPA not solely to serve it, but in effect to also save it; save it from the rampant scandals that had damaged the agency and its professional staff under the early Reagan administration and the tenure of the “do more with less” Anne Gorsuch as EPA head.\nModestly brilliant yet soothingly modest in his dealings with those around him, Ruckelshaus had a way of making fun of himself: Upon returning in the early 80s to the same position he had held in the early 70s, he would wonder out loud how proud his mom must be that he had re-assumed the same job he had held 10 years earlier – and at the same pay grade.\nForever, untouchable or, ironically, “teflon” after resigning as deputy attorney general from the Justice Department rather than execute Nixon’s directive to fire Watergate investigator Archibald Cox (just after Attorney General Elliot Richardson had done the same), Ruckelshaus forever secured his standing as a public servant and official of impeccable integrity and sound judgment.\nBut as for his reputation for self-deprecation, he would comment that: “Retire as EPA Administrator in a Republican administration before you are indicted, and everyone thinks you’re a hero.” In his case, he was indeed.\nAs the first head of the soon-to-be half-century-old EPA, Ruckelshaus set a high bar for all those who have followed him. Many have come nowhere close.\nAn early Republican would-be elected officeholder from Indiana, Ruckelshaus leaves a legacy any cabinet member, EPA administrator, or civil servant can only admire. Reason enough for Time magazine’s long ago having acknowledged him as one of the most effective and widely admired cabinet heads in the nation’s history.\nWhat, indeed, would Ruckelshaus have done, and what would he be doing, if he’d been able to address the daunting challenges posed by the warming of our atmosphere?\nTruth is, we’ll never know.\nWhat we do know, however, is that he wouldn’t have stood idly by as decades of delayed actions passed. Ruckelshaus would not have endlessly pondered one after another “skeptical” rejection of the established body of science.\nAt this point, one cannot say that the nation’s progress – and accordingly that too of much of the Western world’s? – in confronting the climate challenge would have put us miles ahead of the snail’s pace we now find ourselves in. But it’s not a stretch to hold that our collective steps toward making such progress likely would be far better than what we’re seeing currently.\nWhat Ruckelshaus would have done is something our environmental leaders at the federal level, Democratic and Republican, should have been doing all along, to the maximum extent of their capabilities. It’s never too late to start doing the right thing."

One Tells Us ‘We Can’t Wait Any Longer’ For Action\nTwila Moon, at left, and Maria Caffrey at the CPR News studios Friday Nov. 15 2019. The two are climate scientists who discussed the line between activism and science.\nFor decades, scientists have warned of the dangers of human-caused climate change through what they do best — science. But are papers and global summits enough for those concerned that climate change is an existential threat?\nMore than 1,500 scientists recently signed a declaration in support of Extinction Rebellion, the climate activist group that uses nonviolent civil disobedience to encourage government action on reducing carbon emissions. Notable XR protests have included gluing themselves to the gates of London’s Buckingham Palace and interrupting a summit at the Colorado Governor’s Mansion.\nThe scientists’ declaration reads, “The scientific community has already tried all conventional methods to draw attention to the crisis. We believe that continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful and nonviolent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law.”\nScientistsâ€™ Declaration of Support for Non-Violent Direct Action Against Government Inaction Over the Climate and Ecological Emergencyhttps://t.co/Ps6xQkdxfl\n— ScientistsForXR (@ScientistsX) October 13, 2019\nThere’s community disagreement over researchers supporting or participating in displays of activism. Colorado Matters spoke with Twila Moon, a climate scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, and Maria Caffrey, who was a partner with the National Park Service, about those differences.\nCaffrey was recently catapulted onto the national stage after she filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration. She alleges she lost her job with the park service because she refused to eliminate mentions of human-caused climate change from her research.\nMoon chose not to sign the letter while Caffery did sign on in support of the actions of Extinction Rebellion.\nShould Climate Scientists Be Climate Activists?

   "paragraph": "Climate models have accurately predicted global heating, study finds\nPosted on 5 December 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from The Guardian and has been incorporated into the rebuttals to the myth 'Models are unreliable'\nClimate models have accurately predicted global heating for the past 50 years, a study has found.\nThe findings confirm that since as early as 1970, climate scientists have had a solid fundamental understanding of the Earth’s climate system and the ability to project how it will respond to continued increases in the greenhouse effect. Since climate models have accurately anticipated global temperature changes so far, we can expect projections of future warming to be reliable as well.\nThe research examines the accuracy of 17 models published over the past five decades, beginning with a 1970 study and including 1981 and 1988 models led by James Hansen, the former Nasa climatologist who testified to the US Senate in 1988 about the impacts of anthropogenic global heating. The study also includes the first four reports by the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC).\n“We found that climate models – even those published back in the 1970s – did remarkably well, with 14 out of the 17 model projections indistinguishable from what actually occurred,” said Zeke Hausfather, of the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the paper.\nBased on modern climate model projections, if countries follow through with current and pledged climate policies, the world is on track for about 3C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 – a situation the IPCC and others predict would be catastrophic.\nThe challenge in evaluating climate model accuracy lies in the fact that due to computing power limitations, simulations are only run for a few specific future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. There are an infinite number of such possible scenarios, but real-world emissions will follow only one path, and it will never exactly match the few scenarios input into climate models. Thus, if Earth warms less than in a climate model projection, it does not necessarily mean the model was inaccurate.\nPut simply, climate scientists are not in the business of predicting human fossil fuel consumption but are attempting to accurately simulate how the climate will change in response to a given rise in greenhouse gas emissions.\n“Future emissions depend on human behaviour, not physical systems, and climate models should be evaluated on their physics rather than the future emission projections,” said Hausfather.\nIn nearly half of the model projections examined in the paper, the input scenarios were significantly different from the real-world changes in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, projected temperature changes were only consistent with observed global warming in 10 of the 17 models, with four projecting more warming and three projecting less than subsequently occurred.\nHowever, the study authors addressed these inconsistencies by evaluating the change in temperature per change in “radiative forcing” – the global energy imbalance caused by the increased greenhouse effect and other factors – in models against what happened in the real world. This metric reveals whether the climate models are accurately producing the temperature response to a given emissions change – in essence, whether are accurately simulating the physical response of Earth’s climate system. With this factored in, 14 of the 17 models were accurate.\n“The rate of warming we are experiencing today is pretty much exactly what past climate models projected it would be,” said Hausfather.\nClick here to read the rest"

Many of the over 100 journals we scan regularly publish moments of bigger picture thinking, these being distinguished from beery bar chatter because even as they seek to form conclusions or suggestions about where we're headed or may want to go as a society, they're grounded in a foundation of scrupulous attention to facts and evidence. There's too much good thinking of this kind to leave unread, yet these musings don't fit the strict definition of research publications. To account for all of this, we've added a section at the bottom of the weekly research roundups titled \"Informed opinion and nudges.\" Some select governmental and NGO whitepapers with roots in solid science may also be found there.\n*Apologies to Lebowski\nUpdate to global warming \"hiatus\" research survey\nFor many years Skeptical Science volunteer Ari Jokimäki published this weekly research review. Of late Ari's been working on updating his massive literature review/compendium of papers investigating a seeming slowdown in warming that was for a time unaccounted for in Earth's energy budget, the so-called \"global warming hiatus.\" The latest version is now published as Global Warming Hiatus papers, version 3.0. Constructing and maintaining this assembly is a massive amount of picky work— hats off to Ari.\nNear and dear to Skeptical Science\nTwo papers in this month's list are particularly germane to Skeptical Science.\nQuestioning scientific practice: linking beliefs about scientists, science agencies, and climate change examines public attitudes and beliefs about science and scientific researchers. In plain language, what authors Safford et al identify is quite familiar: when confronted with unassailable facts and evidence, people posing as \"skeptics\" and pursuing various agendas are forced to abandon actual argument, shifting instead to ad hominem attacks on character. That's not a fair or honestly productive means of discourse, but the authors also identify possible ways of mitigating effects of such tactics. From the abstract:\nThe climate-change debate in the U.S. has increasingly turned from discussing climate data and scientific consensus to questioning the credibility of scientists. While disinterested unbiased assessment of data is a fundamental norm within the scientific community, it is unclear whether the public believes scientists are objective in their practices or how general views about scientists’ integrity shape acceptance of climate-related scientific claims... Our results suggest that the scientific community may need to expand discussion of the ethics and rigor of their practices when discussing climate change and point to the importance of further sociological investigation of how perceptions of scientists and scientific practices shape climate views.\nIn Patterns of controversy and consensus in German, Canadian, and US online news on climate change, Tschötsche, Schuck and Wonneberger identify some distinguishing characteristics of style and slant in climate news coverage across national boundaries. Highlights:\nGerman media focus on controversies about efficacy and portray a wide range of actors.\nCanadian media emphasise consensus to limit emissions, but rarely discuss efficacy.\nUS media foreground political divisions concerning the need for policy to limit emissions.\nRare portrayals of controversy about climate science are driven by US politicians.\nMedia seem to index seemingly relevant positions across countries, with variation in emphasis.\n65 Articles:\nPhysical science of global warming\nOn the impact of future climate change on tropopause folds and tropospheric ozone (open access)\nEarly Holocene temperature oscillations exceed amplitude of observed and projected warming in Svalbard lakes\nPhysical observations of global warming and effects\nSupraglacial lake drainage at a fast-flowing Greenlandic outlet glacier (open access)\nAnalysis of polarimetric satellite measurements suggests stronger cooling due to aerosol-cloud interactions (open access)\nMulti‐decadal changes in meteorological drought severity and their drivers in mainland China\nMeltwater intrusions reveal mechanisms for rapid submarine melt at a tidewater glacier\nImpact of West Antarctic Ice Shelf melting on the Southern Ocean Hydrography (open access)\nChanges in temperature extremes on the Tibetan Plateau and their attribution\nModeling global warming & global warming effects\nSimulated retreat of Jakobshavn Isbræ during the 21st century (open access)\nDetecting Climate Change Effects on Vb‐Cyclones in a 50‐Member Single‐Model Ensemble Using Machine Learning\nDo CMIP5 models show El Niño diversity?\nWhy do crop models diverge substantially in climate impact projections?

   "title": "Cranky Uncle crowdfunding campaign launches!",
   "paragraph": "Cranky Uncle crowdfunding campaign launches!\nPosted on 3 December 2019 by John Cook\nCranky Uncle Matching Gift! We're closing in on our stretch goal to fund Cranky Uncleas an Android app. $6,000 will finish this stretch goal. To get us over the line, two anonymous contributors have agreed to match other contributions until midnight of December 31st, dollar for dollar up to $3,000, taking us past the post. Double your impact by contributing right now while you're thinking about it! To all those who've already contributed, a huge Thank You!\nWe've just launched our crowdfunding campaign to develop the Cranky Uncle smartphone game. The purpose of this free game is to teach resilience against misinformation. We've already tested the game in college classes across the country, finding it increases students' ability to detect reasoning fallacies in misinformation across a range of topics. You can donate to help turn our game into reality at the Cranky Uncle Crowdfunding Page.\nLest I bury the lede, I should mention the most time-sensitive element of our crowdfunding campaign: I'm going to personally draw the first 97 early birds who donate $250 or more in our Giving Tuesday event. These cartoons will be an integral part of the game, used in critical thinking quiz questions that help players practice spotting logical fallacies in false arguments. But I'm only offering this reward to the first 97 Cameo donors because I have to draw you all myself and there are only so many hours in the day! Here's what the process looks like (starring Brendan deMelle from Desmogblog):\nWe are actually offering a wide range of rewards and swag for supporters of the Cranky Uncle game. While you get a brief overview of the rewards at the Cranky Uncle crowdfunding page, here is a more detailed breakdown of each reward:\n$10 or more: Game Supporter\nAnyone who donates $10 or more will get their name listed in the credits of the game as well as on the crankyuncle.com website. You'll also receive behind-the-scenes updates as we develop the game and conduct research into how cartoons, critical thinking, and gameplay can counter misinformation. That's right, the inside scoop on cutting-edge research into how the combination of art, science, and technology can overcome fake news - who wouldn't want a piece of that?!\n$25 or more: Beta Tester\nAs well as Game Supporter rewards (credit + behind-the-scenes updates), you'll get the opportunity to be an early access beta-tester. In other words, you can help us shape the Cranky Uncle game, making it more effective in building resilience against misinformation (as well as more fun and entertaining). In addition, I have created three Cranky Uncle digital wallpapers that you can use on the background of your computer or tablet - these will be exclusive to supporters of the Cranky Uncle game:\n$50 or more: Cranky Uncle Book\nOn 25 February 2020, I'll publish the 176-page book, Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change, published by Kensington Books.\nThis book examines every aspect of climate science denial, using cartoons and critical thinking to debunk myths denying the reality of global warming, human-causation of climate change, the severity of climate impacts, and denial of climate science itself. Because the book is such a comprehensive treatment of climate misinformation, I've spent the last year grabbing cartoons from the book and posting responses to current climate misinformation on Instagram or Twitter.\nAs well as Beta Tester rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, and digital wallpapers), anyone who donates $50 or more will receive a copy of the book to be sent out when the book is published.\n$97 or more: The 97% Club\nA few months ago, geologist Callan Bentley asked if I could supply a cartoon poster for a climate art gallery he was organizing. I dusted off the artwork from the 97 Hours of Consensus and adapted it into a poster. Here is a 30 x 20 inch version of the poster which was displayed at Callan's climate art gallery:\nWhile organizing the different donor levels for our crowdfunding campaign, I felt a gravitational pull towards including a $97 reward level, and once that decision was made, it seemed inevitable that we include a 97% consensus poster as swag (well, it does in hindsight). So we made some adjustments to the original poster (added a background) and increased the size to 35 x 25 inches.\nAs well as Cranky Book rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, digital wallpapers, and the Cranky Book), anyone who donates $97 or more will receive the 97% consensus poster. Not only will you get a cool cartoon poster for your wall, you'll also be raising awareness of the 97% scientific consensus on climate change - shown in many studies to be a highly effective climate communication message. And you'll help solve that public malaise where most people can't name a living scientist!\n$125 or more: Cranky Moods T-Shirt\nAs you play the Cranky Uncle game, you learn new denial techniques and accumulate cranky points. Your goal is to earn so many cranky points that you become a cranky uncle. This feature of the game is (somewhat) reflected in the Cranky Moods T-shirt.\nAs well as 97 Club rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, digital wallpapers, the Cranky Book, and the 97% consensus poster), anyone who donates $125 or more will receive the Cranky Moods T-shirt. The T-shirt sizes available are S, M, L, XL, 2XL, and 3XL.\n$150 or more: Make Earth Cool Again Cap\nAs I wrote and drew Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change in 2018, the cartoon character that grew on me the most was Earth - the suffering (but adorable) victim of climate change. He was so much fun to draw, I kept coming up with new reasons to include him more in the book (anyone who knows Deke Arndt will know where I'm going with the below comic strip).\nSo of course I had to include an Earth cartoon in the Cranky Uncle rewards. A Make Earth Cool Again cap seemed an obvious idea - it lets you publicly show your support for climate action with an adorable Earth cartoon character!\nAs well as the Cranky Moods T-shirt rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, digital wallpapers, the Cranky Book, the 97% consensus poster, and the Cranky Moods T-shirt), anyone who donates $150 or more will receive the Make Earth Cool Again cap. You can choose a blue or green cap.\n$250 or more: EARLY BIRD: Cameo!\nOne key to the success of educational games is that they're fun and entertaining, as well as instructive. A recurring comment we've heard from students so far who played the game was overwhelmingly positive reaction to the cartoons scattered throughout the game (my other favorite comment from a student was \"it helps you outsmart boomers\"). In the game, I use cartoons both to explain fallacies (a technique known as parallel argumentation) and in quiz questions.\nHaving drawn cartoon caricatures of climate scientists in the 97 Hours of Consensus campaign, and being a glutton for punishment, I decided to offer to draw donors and include them in cartoons used throughout the game. But I am setting a cap on the number of people I'll be drawing for this reward to 97. Yes, I do have a bit of a thing for that number!\nAs well as the Make Earth Cool Again Cap rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, digital wallpapers, the Cranky Book, the 97% consensus poster, the Cranky Moods T-shirt, and the Make Earth Cool Again cap), I will draw the first 97 people who donate $250 or more and include them in the game! This is a first-in-first-served offer - once we hit 97 donors, this reward level will be closed. Sorry but I'm just one person and there are only so many hours in the day!\n$1000 or more: Producer\nAs well as the Cameo rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, digital wallpapers, the Cranky Book, the 97% consensus poster, the Cranky Moods T-shirt, the Make Earth Cool Again cap, and getting drawn in the game), anyone who donates $1000 or more will be listed as a Producer in the game/website credits.\n$5000 or more: Executive Producer\nAs well as the Cameo rewards (credit, behind-the-scenes updates, beta-testing, digital wallpapers, the Cranky Book, the 97% consensus poster, the Cranky Moods T-shirt, the Make Earth Cool Again cap, and getting drawn in the game), anyone who donates $5000 or more will be listed as a Executive Producer in the game/website credits.\nThe greatest reward: supporting the fight against climate denial!\nSwag is great. But ultimately, the Cranky Uncle game is about fighting climate denial, removing a roadblock that has delayed meaningful climate action for decades. By supporting our crowdfunding campaign, you help us release a game that will build a more resilient public against misinformation. The greater the amount of support we receive, the more ambitious we get with this game and the greater the societal impact. The more funding we raise, the closer we get to our vision of getting this free game into classrooms all over the world, creating a generation of students resilient against fake news.\nSo please donate to help us make the Cranky Uncle game reality. And share our game with your friends, colleagues, and social media networks. Thanks for your support!\nJohn Cook"

   "title": "UN report: Pollution from planned fossil fuel production would overshoot Paris climate goals",
   "paragraph": "UN report: Pollution from planned fossil fuel production would overshoot Paris climate goals\nPosted on 2 December 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nIn the 2015 international Paris Climate Agreement, nearly every country [see editor’s note] agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and preferably closer to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures. Achieving these goals will require dramatic changes, as the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), and temperatures, fossil fuel consumption, and carbon pollution all are continuing to rise.\nTo determine how far off track emissions are with respect to the Paris goals, groups like the International Energy Agency and Climate Action Tracker evaluate each country’s climate policies. According to their analyses, were each country to follow through only with current policies, global temperatures would rise about 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures by the year 2100 – a level of warming that would result in severe and dangerous climate changes.\nIn addition, a new report produced by the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, and a coalition of research organizations takes a different approach: The report examines government plans for fossil fuel production and the amount of carbon pollution and global warming that would result if all these fuels were burned.\n“Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions”, UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a statement releasing the report. So urgent is the need for action, he said, that “every city, region, business and individual need(s) to act now”.\nThe resulting picture is indeed bleak – total carbon emissions between now and 2030 from global fossil fuel production plans are about 10% higher than those from the current climate policies that would put the world on track for 3 degrees Celsius warming by 2100. These fossil fuel plans present a difficult impediment to meeting the Paris climate goals.\nThe challenge, by the numbers\nAccording to the newly released figures, to stay on track to meet the 2 degrees Celsius Paris target, the fossil fuel supply can release only about 350 billion more tons of carbon dioxide between now and 2030, and a total of 550 billion tons by 2040. For the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, the numbers are about 300 billion tons by 2030 and 450 billion tons by 2040.\nBased on the analyses of current pledged climate policies, humans are currently on track to exceed the 2 degree path by 17% by 2030 and 36% by 2040. Those are policies that would instead send the world towards the 3 degrees Celsius warming scenario by 2100.\nHowever, based on countries’ fossil fuel production plans, carbon pollution will be about 10% higher yet. Those plans translate to about 450 billion tons of carbon dioxide released between now and 2030, and nearly 850 billion tons by 2040. For the latter date, it’s an overshoot of the 2 degrees Paris carbon budgets by 50%, and 85% too much carbon to stay on the 1.5 degrees Celsius path.\nIn short, if countries follow through with their current fossil fuel production plans, the world will be on track to warm more than 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F) by 2100, and meeting the Paris targets would become virtually impossible.\nAchieving Paris goals means ‘stranding’ valuable assets\nThe Paris agreement includes “a global stocktake every five years” starting in 2023, at which point countries can ratchet up their climate goals and policies. Implementing such policies often is a political and economic challenge, and reducing planned fossil fuel production may be even more difficult.\nAccording to a recent study published in the journal Energy Research & Social Science, for the world to meet the Paris 2 degrees Celsius target, more than 80% of all proven fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground – by no means an easy choice in any capitalist system or democratic society. The reserves and some associated infrastructure would then become “stranded assets,” meaning that they no longer hold any value.\nThese goals are difficult to reconcile with the reality that, as the data document, many large countries plan to expand rather than reduce their fossil fuel production over the coming decades. In the United States, oil and gas production is projected to increase 30% above current levels by 2030. Chinese coal production currently accounts for 43% of the global total, has expanded the past two years, and is forecast to decline slowly after 2020 as the country’s natural gas production ramps up. India foresees more than a tripling of coal production by 2040. Australia, currently the world’s leading exporter of coal and the second-largest producer and exporter of liquid natural gas, has proposed opening new coal mines and ports in one of the world’s largest fossil fuel expansions. And in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described a Trans Mountain pipeline expansion transporting tar sands oil to coastal ports as being “of vital strategic interest to Canada.” The country’s oil and natural gas production are projected to increase 60% and 34%, respectively, between 2017 and 2040.\nThe new UNEP report calmly and briefly summarizes the challenges posed by these planned fossil fuel expansions:\nOnce built, this infrastructure is difficult to turn away from; it decreases fossil fuel prices, hooks consumers on fossil fuels, and deeply entangles many parts of society – including workers and communities – in a fossil fuel economy.\nIn other words, the more countries invest in expanding fossil fuel extraction infrastructure now, the costlier and more difficult it becomes down the road to strand the assets as needed to meet the Paris targets.\n‘Supply-side’ policy solutions\nClimate policies have tended to focus on reducing fossil fuel demand, for example by taxing carbon pollution, fostering alternative energy sources, and improving energy efficiency. To tackle the problem of excessive fossil fuel production, the report recommends several “supply-side” climate policies.\nFor example, while the leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) countries with the world’s largest economies in 2009 committed to “phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”, many governments have instead kept most of their fossil fuel production subsidies, and some have even introduced new ones. According to the International Monetary Fund, global fossil fuel subsidies amount to more than $5 trillion per year, accounting for 6.4% of the global gross domestic product (although only $500 billion of this total comes from direct subsidies, with the remainder resulting from a failure to price carbon pollution). Eliminating fossil fuel subsidies is one straightforward supply-side policy solution.\nThe new UNEP report notes that governments can also limit fossil fuel exploration, production, or export via moratoria, bans, or quotas: “The governments of Belize, Costa Rica, France, Denmark, and New Zealand, for instance, have all enacted partial or total bans or moratoria on oil and gas exploration and extraction.” And governments can prohibit development of, or limit permits for, specific resources and infrastructure like oil pipelines and coal terminals, or the use of certain technologies like hydraulic fracking.\nState-controlled investment funds can divest from fossil fuel production companies, and policymakers could tax fossil fuel production. Most directly, governments can set targets to reduce rather than expand fossil fuel production, and restrict financing for fossil fuel supply projects through government-owned finance institutions.\nSuch policies are clearly politically and economically difficult to implement in light of the vast wealth and political influence of fossil fuel companies, and what many see as consumers’ virtual addiction to fossil fuels. However, there are many examples of countries already implementing such steps. Experts increasingly have come to agree that to have any chance of meeting the Paris climate targets, governments will have to recognize that trillions of dollars of fossil fuel assets will need to be stranded, and plans and policies undertaken accordingly."

With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to increase, even more drastic reductions are needed to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.\n“Any further delay brings the need for larger, more expensive and unlikely cuts,” wrote Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme in the Emissions Gap Report 2019. “We need quick wins, or the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach.”\nAnd the impacts of climate change are already here. Climate scientists told us late last year in the National Climate Assessment that the United States is already experiencing the severe and costly consequences of a changing climate. In a separate United Nations report released in October, scientists reported that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require a gargantuan global effort to halve emissions — and that we have roughly 12 years to do it.

   "title": "Harnessing gamification to defeat climate misinformation",
   "paragraph": "Harnessing gamification to defeat climate misinformation\nPosted on 26 November 2019 by John Cook\nFor the past decade, I've been researching the psychology of climate denial, exploring ways to counter misinformation about climate change. I came out of my PhD with inoculation as a powerful solution. After completing my PhD, I explored critical thinking as a tool to help develop inoculating messages.\nOne of the most intriguing leads from my critical thinking work was the potential of parallel arguments. This involves taking the flawed reasoning in misinformation and transplanting it into an absurd situation, making the logical fallacy more obvious. A lightbulb moment for me was realizing that this technique was used every night by late night comedians to debunk the misinformation of the day, in a way that was both entertaining and instructive.\nHaving worked as a cartoonist before my PhD, I immediately saw that cartoons were the perfect delivery mechanism for parallel arguments. So for the last two years, I've been experimentally testing parallel arguments as a means of countering misinformation on social media. Not only has this research shown that my funny is statistically significant (yes, that was the first thing I checked after data collection), we have also shown that parallel arguments in cartoon form are effective in neutralizing misinformation.\nThree challenges in building a resilient public\nDespite progress made in these various lines of research, there remain several formidable social and psychological challenges to putting these scientific findings into practice:\nFast thinking: Our brains have evolved to react to immediate threats such as predators jumping out of bushes, and instinctive, fast thinking (otherwise known as system 1 thinking) dominates our psychology. Performing slow, reasoned thinking (known as system 2 thinking) is effortful and challenging—not because we're stupid but because our brains are hardwired for fast thinking.\nTribalism: The greatest driver of climate denial is political affiliation (with political ideology a close second). In other words, which political tribe we belong to determines what we believe about the greenhouse effect and climate science. This means that communicating climate science to people who are politically motivated to disbelieve the science is usually ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive.\nEcho chambers: Even if we develop inoculating messages that can overcome fast thinking and tribalism, our society has evolved towards echo chambers where people consume information from sources that they agree with. While cable television began this process, social media platforms have accelerated the problem, using algorithms to deliver content tailored to maximize user interaction and link-clicking. Their business models depend on delivering belief-confirming information.\nIn recent years, I have continued my research into inoculation while not knowing what to do about those unanswered challenges. A new branch of inoculation research, begun by Sander van der Linden, explored how a game where players interactively learnt the techniques of fake news could train people to detect the tell-tale red flags of fake news. Sander's game focused on teaching media literacy. I wondered whether his approach of \"active inoculation\" could also work against science denial.\nI began designing a game that taught the techniques of denial. One powerful element of gamification is the capacity to use characters and narrative to engage and inform players. I created an archetypal \"Cranky Uncle\" character who mentored you in the techniques of denial—teaching you how to earn cranky points and eventually become a cranky uncle yourself. I also used cartoon parallel arguments to illustrate understanding of the logical fallacies.\nWhenever I mentioned the game to climate scientists, college professors, and high school teachers, I was (pleasantly) surprised at their strong interest in incorporating the game into their lessons. Without even trying, I had educators across the country interested in testing the game and assessing its effectiveness in increasing critical thinking skills.\nThis made me realize that gamification offered a potential solution to one of science denial's great problems: piercing through echo chambers. Given the hunger in educators for interactive resources that engage students, there was strong potential for a game that taught both climate science and critical thinking to be adopted in classes in red and blue counties all over the country. The seemingly insurmountable challenge of echo chambers suddenly seemed manageable.\nTurning critical thinking into muscle memory\nI also incorporated quiz questions to get players practicing spotting different types of fallacies. I ran a series of quizzes via Twitter, receiving a great deal of feedback that helped me improve the design of my questions. I incorporated much of this advice in the game design:\nAs I developed a large library of fallacy quiz questions, I began to realize that gamification offered a powerful opportunity for educators seeking to teach critical thinking. By using game features such as interactive quizzes, points and rewards systems, and player-to-player contests, players were motivated to continue practicing assessing arguments, spotting fallacies, and honing their critical thinking skills. Essentially, games can help turn a slow thinking task like argument assessment into a fast thinking reaction. Gamification has the potential to turn critical thinking into muscle memory.\nI also began talking to Autonomy Coop, a group of marketers using their professional skills for social good. We began a collaboration testing parallel argument cartoons on Facebook (one of our experiments involved sending cartoons debunking the \"cold weather disproves global warming\" myth into conservative parts of the country about to get hit by a polar vortex cold spell). In our conversations, they opened my minds to the power of players competing against other players, or even more exciting, groups competing against other groups.\nI began to imagine a critical thinking tournament, where classes in one school would compete against classes in other schools across the country. Regional contests draw on tribal instincts to motivate players to improve and compete. Imagine tribal instincts motivating students to hone their critical thinking skills, strengthening their resilience against misinformation. The chief driver of climate denial could be employed to help eradicate science denial!\nSo I began testing a prototype of the game in community colleges and universities. In collaboration with Jasper Fessmann from West Virginia University and David Kinkead from the University of Queensland, we developed a quiz that measured students' ability to detect 11 types of science denial techniques. We tested student's fallacy-detection skills before and after playing a prototype of the Cranky Uncle game. We found that critical thinking ability increased after just 30 minutes of game-play.\nThe most exciting thing about this research is that the quiz questions were non-climate-related. A game that explained logical fallacies in climate misinformation imparted resilience against other types of misinformation. Inoculation researchers call this the \"umbrella of protection\", and is one of the most powerful aspects of logic-based inoculation.\nCrowd-funding development of the Cranky Uncle game\nAlso exciting was that the improvement in critical thinking came from a simple prototype that only simulated the game—it wasn't a properly programmed native app. That is the next step in this project. In order to fund development of the game, I will be launching a crowd-funding campaign early next week. You can sign up to be notified of when we launch at crankyuncle.com.\nI've only been involved in crowd-funding once before. In 2013, we crowdfunded the journal fee required to publish our paper on the scientific consensus on climate change. We were surprised and delighted that it only took 9 hours to raise the $1,600 journal fee. The only disappointment was that given our international readership, some people woke up to find we'd already raised the funds and never got to contribute to what turned out to be a historic paper. We thought the consensus study might be significant at the time but never dreamed it would attract attention from world leaders such as President Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, and be downloaded over one million times (actually now up to 1,106,341 downloads).\nThis time, rather than cap our crowdfunding amount, the more funds we raise, the more ambitious our game will become and the greater the societal impact. Here is a brief summary of our stretch goals depending on how successful our crowdfunding campaign is:\n$15,000: iPhone game. Our initial goal will fund development of a native iPhone/iPad version of the game.\n$25,000: Android game. We will also develop an Android version (I'm really hoping we don't end up between $15,000 and $25,000 as I will never stop hearing from Android users).\n$35,000: Multi-lingual version of the game. Thanks to the ever-amazing Bärbel Winkler, Skeptical Science has a robust set of translation volunteers with our rebuttals translated into 20 languages. Our plan is to release the game in German, then explore translation into other languages.\n$50,000: Player-to-player functionality. Adding player-to-player contests will take the Cranky Uncle game to the next level. By adding a social element to the game, it makes it much easier for people to invite friends, challenge people to contests, and help spread critical thinking through social networks. It will also motivate people to play the game longer—the more they play, the more opportunity they’ll have to hone their critical thinking skills.\n$70,000: Classroom functionality. The game is most effective when played in a classroom setting, where educators can seamlessly incorporate the game into their lessons. We will develop resources for teachers within the game, such as the ability to track the progress of a class of students, monitoring individual progress and identifying which fallacies students are struggling with. I will also develop educational resources to complement the game play (I've already given guest talks to a number of classes, my favorite part being when I role-play with the teacher with me playing Cranky Uncle).\n$100,000: Group-to-group functionality. Imagine if a classroom could challenge another classroom to a critical thinking contest, either in the same school or even across schools! Cards on the table: my long-term hope is the game will culminate in a nationwide (or even global) \"Cranky Bowl\" critical thinking tournament.\nOne more thing (for now). There is only one time limit with this crowd-funding campaign. We will be offering a number of rewards for donors (more on this later) but the top reward will be a cameo appearance in the game. In other words, I will draw a caricature of you into a parallel argument cartoon that will be used to illustrate a specific denialist technique. For example, I will draw one donor into this example of cherry picking:\nHowever, I'm only offering this reward to the first 97 \"Cameo\" donors. Why 97? First, because if you haven't noticed yet, I have a bit of a thing for the number 97. Second, drawing 97 people is a lot of work! Drawing 97 climate scientists nearly killed me! So only the first 97 Cameo backers will get immortalized in the game. If you want to be one of the first to find out when the crowd-funding campaign launches, sign up at crankyuncle.com."

The damage will be very real. But that damage won’t make it harder, come 2021 or 2025 or 2030, to do the right thing about healthcare.\nBut the climate crisis doesn’t work like that. If we don’t solve it soon, we will never solve it, because we will pass a series of irrevocable tipping points – and we’re clearly now approaching those deadlines. You can tell because there’s half as much ice in the Arctic, and because forests catch fire with heartbreaking regularity and because we see record deluge.

   "paragraph": "New report finds costs of climate change impacts often underestimated\nPosted on 20 November 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nClimate economics researchers have often underestimated – sometimes badly underestimated – the costs of damages resulting from climate change. Those underestimates occur particularly in scenarios where Earth’s temperature warms beyond the Paris climate target of 1.5 to 2 degrees C (2.7 to 3.6 degrees F).\nThat’s the conclusion of a new report written by a team of climate and Earth scientists and economists from the Earth Institute at Columbia University, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. It’s a conclusion consistent with the findings of numerous recent climate economics studies.\nOnce temperatures warm beyond those Paris targets, the risks of triggering unprecedented climate damages grow. However, because the rate and magnitude of climate change has entered uncharted territory in human history, the temperature thresholds and severity of future climate impacts remain highly uncertain, and thus difficult to capture in climate economics models. Put simply, it’s difficult to project the economic impacts resulting from circumstances which are themselves unprecedented.\nFor example, if the science community does not know the temperature at which various “tipping points” might occur – things like accelerated ice sheet collapse or large carbon releases from the warming oceans or melting permafrost – then economics models will exclude the associated impacts (rapid sea-level rise or accelerated climate change).\nAdditionally, climate change economic cost estimates have traditionally suffered from questionable assumptions about continued economic growth, and from an inability to account for non-monetized values.\nThe challenges of unprecedented climate change\nResearch has shown that humans are warming the climate at a rate 20 to 50 times faster than some of Earth’s fastest natural climate change events. Global temperatures may already be hotter than they have been during all of human civilization, and they continue to rise rapidly.\nContinuing on this rapid warming path will create a “rising probability that major thresholds in the Earth’s climate system will be breached as global mean surface temperature rises, particularly if warming exceeds 2°C above the pre-industrial level,” according to the authors of the new study. Some of these thresholds include even more severe extreme weather events (e.g. drought, heat, floods, and hurricanes), destabilizing ice sheets and the resulting sea-level rise, destruction of biodiversity, and collapsing ecosystems.\nClimate models incorporate these impacts as best as they can – some better than others – but as Earth’s climate enters a state unprecedented in human history, the range and severity of damages become increasingly difficult to accurately account for. Climate economics modelers like recent Nobel Laureate William Nordhaus incorporate these climate damages into their models through what’s called the “damage function.” However, as Nordhaus has noted, “estimates of damage functions are virtually non-existent for temperature increases above 3°C. … The damage function needs to be examined carefully or re-specified in cases of higher warming or catastrophic damages.”\nFor example, Nordhaus’ model suggests that global warming of 6 degrees C (about 11 degrees F) – which would have catastrophic impacts on society and ecosystems – would reduce global income by only 8.5 percent. A 2010 paper led by the late economist Frank Ackerman found that not until global warming reached 19 degrees C (34 degrees F – a global temperature that is virtually incompatible with life) did the model yield a 50% reduction in economic output.\nContinued economic growth: How reliable?\nOne problem is that these climate economic models tend to assume that the global economy will continue to grow reliably regardless of the magnitude of climate change. As climate historian Naomi Oreskes and British economist Nicholas Stern recently wrote in the New York Times, the models “approach climate damages as minor perturbations around an underlying path of economic growth, and take little account of the fundamental destruction that we might be facing because it is so outside humanity’s experience.” As Stern and economist Simon Dietz concluded in a 2015 paper, these models have “in‐built assumptions on growth, damage and risk, which together result in gross underassessment of the overall scale of the risks from unmanaged climate change.”\nNumerous recent climate economics research papers have concluded that, as one might expect, continued climate change will indeed hamper economic growth. For example, that is the conclusion of\n– a 2012 study led by Melissa Dell at MIT;\n– a 2015 paper by Frances C. Moore and Delavane B. Diaz at Stanford;\n– a 2015 study by Marshall Burke, Solomon M. Hsiang, and Edward Miguel at Stanford and Berkeley; and\n– a 2018 working paper by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that focused on the American economy.\nThe 2015 study led by Burke found evidence of an optimal temperature for economic activity. Regions with average temperatures around 13 degrees C (55 degrees F, like the U.S., Japan, China, and much of Europe) have the strongest economies. As temperatures warm beyond that sweet spot, economic productivity weakens, which is especially problematic for poorer countries nearer to the equator that already have sub-optimally hot climates.\nIn short, economic models assuming that the global economy will continue to hum along with only relatively minor climate perturbation will inevitably underestimate the economic impacts of severe climate change. The economy has consistently grown in the past, but that doesn’t mean it must continue to grow rapidly in the future in the face of potentially extreme changes to the climate and widespread societal impacts.\nUndervaluing future wellbeing and non-monetary factors\nAnother complication lies in what economists call the “discount rate.” Simply put, because saved money accrues interest (because of historically reliable economic growth), it’s assumed to be worth more in the future than money spent today. However, it’s easy to see where this assumption can go wrong in a world with unprecedented climate change. Saving money today rather than spending it to curb global warming could lead to severe future impacts on the economy and society. As the new report puts it, “Inappropriate discounting by economists can lead to very significant future impacts … to be treated as if they are relatively trivial compared with current impacts.”\nAnd finally, it’s easy to forget that not everything can be evaluated based on economic costs alone. As a recent Special Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted, “Many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services are difficult to value and monetize.” A powerful hurricane might have a relatively small economic impact, but the lost lives, homes, stability, and other intangibles can carry significant non-monetary value and create trauma and suffering. For example, one study found that nearly half of low-income parents impacted by Hurricane Katrina experienced post-traumatic stress disorder.\nUnless it addresses these shortcomings, economic forecasting is likely to continue to underestimate the true costs of climate change. In 2013, Stanford’s Jonathan Koomey published a paper suggesting that instead of relying on economic cost-benefit analyses, climate policy should be shaped by “working forward toward a goal” like the Paris climate targets. In this framework, economics would be used for evaluating the most cost-effective policies to meet the targets, rather than for setting goals or arguing that all policies are too expensive so humans should instead just learn to adapt to the changing climate. A substantial amount of research has shown that approach of simple adaptation will be the costliest option of all."

   "paragraph": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #46, 2019\nPosted on 19 November 2019 by doug_bostrom\nGem of nature, moral hazard, or attractive nuisance?\nIt's hard to miss the inherent tension in Welling & Abegg's Following the ice: adaptation processes of glacier tour operators in Southeast Iceland:\nThe growing recognition that global climatic change is a pressing reality and that its impacts on humans and ecological systems are inevitable makes adaptation a core topic in climate change research and policymaking. The glacier tourism sector that is highly sensitive towards changing climatic conditions is among the most relevant in this respect. This study aims to examine empirically how adaptation to climate change impacts is practiced by small- and middle-scale glacier tour operators. Data was collected by means of a set of semi-structured interviews with the managers or owners of nine small- or middle-scale tour companies operating in the Vatnajökull National Park in Southeast Iceland and observations of glacier sites where the respondents’ companies are operating. The results indicate that all entrepreneurs consider climate change to be a real phenomenon that affects their present daily operations, but they perceive these implications not as significant threats to their business. The interaction of operator’s attributes of agency such as firsthand experiences, risk perceptions, and abilities to self-organize, with structural elements of the glacier destination system such as economic rationales and hazard reduction institutions, has shaped and consolidated operators’ adaptation processes in the form of a wait-and-see strategy combined with ad hoc reactive adaptation measures and postponed or prevented proactive long-term adaptation strategies.\nEmphasis ours. We may safely assume that the vast majority of visitors to these glaciers are arriving on Iceland via aircraft.

   "title": "Here Are 3 Climategate Myths That Have Not Aged Well",
   "paragraph": "Here Are 3 Climategate Myths That Have Not Aged Well\nPosted on 18 November 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from DeSmogUK\nExcessive media coverage of an email hacking tilted the outcome of a critically important event against the victims of the crime. Sound familiar?\nIn 2016, it happened to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. That was déjà vu for climate scientists, who seven years earlier had experienced a nearly identical chain of events leading up to the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen.\nIn summary: emails from the University of East Anglia in the UK were hacked, and many journalists assumed that where there was smoke, there must be fire. Even the Daily Show’s Jon Stewart jumped on the bandwagon, accusing climate scientists of trying to “trick you” based on a few selective, out-of-context quotes from the hacked emails (though he also later ripped the media for not covering the debunking of the Climategate myth). Commentators at the time were divided over whether this was a media storm, or just a storm in a very British teacup.\nNonetheless, the Copenhagen climate summit a few weeks later was widely considered a failure. That wasn’t only because of the hacked emails, just as another cache of emails aren’t the sole reason for the words “President Donald Trump” — but in both cases the media-amplified story played a significant role in shaping subsequent events.\nNine separate inquiries into the email hack exonerated the climate scientists, but came well after the damage had been done. And a decade on, many of the climate science denial myths that emerged from the email hack are still in play.\nSo, on the 10th anniversary of what came to be known as ‘Climategate’, let’s examine three of the key email quotes that so captured the media’s attention, and how the associated science has since evolved.\nSpoiler: the deniers’ lies haven’t aged well.\nThe misunderstood 'trick'\nOne quote regularly mangled (most recently in a myth-filled Telegraph article, which was evaluated by the climate scientists at Climate Feedback as having “very low” scientific credibility) referred to using “Mike’s Nature trick … to hide the decline.” The ellipses mask that two separate issues were being discussed in this hacked email.\nFirst, climate scientist Michael Mann’s “Nature trick” simply refers to adding temperature measurements from modern instruments to a chart illustrating indirect “proxy” temperature estimates (i.e., analyzing tree ring sizes) in the more distant past. The use of the word “trick” in the email was in the context of “trick of the trade,” not “tricking the audience.” If the latter were the case, the use of two different sources of data would not have been labeled as explicitly as possible in Mann’s scientific paper and subsequent reports.\nSecond, “hiding the decline” referred to the fact that indirect proxy temperature estimates from tree rings were known to be unreliable after about 1960. From about 1960 to 1990 they showed temperatures falling, whereas we know temperatures actually rose during that time.\nTree ring data matched other temperature records accurately prior to 1960 before diverging from the reliable instrumental record thereafter. Climate science research has linked this so-called “divergence problem” to increases in human-caused pollution in recent decades. The email in question was merely suggesting adding reliable instrumental temperature measurement data so that the chart being discussed didn’t end with a segment of data showing a “decline” that was known to be inaccurate. So, in fact, the “trick” was an effort to give as accurate information as possible (rather than the opposite, as was repeatedly alleged).\nA related quote (also included in the Telegraph article) claimed that climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck asserted that “we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP).” This is a fabrication — Overpeck actually said, “I'm not the only one who would like to deal a mortal blow to the misuse of supposed warm period terms and myths in the literature.”\nOverpeck was correct that the MWP is incorrectly referenced regularly. For example, the recent much-maligned Telegraph article went on to claim that the MWP (which roughly spanned the years 900 to 1300 AD) “was even hotter than today,” which is a relatively widespread myth. Numerous studies have reconstructed temperatures over the past several thousand years since Mann and colleagues published their paper in the scientific journal Nature in 1998. All have arrived at the same conclusion: that the MWP was at most a small blip in average global temperatures and that current temperatures are significantly hotter.\nThe most recent and robust such reconstruction was completed by a team of over 5,000 scientists from more than 100 countries contributing to the Past Global Changes (PAGES) 2k network, which produced the following chart of global temperatures over the past 2,000 years. It shows temperatures today rapidly rising above the historical record like the blade of a hockey stick.\nGlobal mean surface temperature history over the Common Era (Pages 2k, Nature Geoscience, 2019)\nRecord ocean heat\nAnother oft-referenced quote comes from a stolen email from climate scientist Kevin Trenberth saying, “we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't.”\nAs Trenberth has explained, this email referred to the fact that when it was written in October 2009, measurements of the amount of heat in the Earth’s climate system didn’t match what they should have been based on the overall global energy imbalance (more incoming than outgoing energy) measured by satellites. This discrepancy was due to the limitations of our observational systems, particularly in the deeper oceans — a limitation that at the time frustrated climate scientists like Trenberth.\nFortunately for Trenberth’s distress levels, measurements of the heat content of the oceans have improved significantly over the past decade, especially with more data coming from the Argo float network and its 3,000 buoys deployed in oceans around the world. In recent research, Trenberth and colleagues have now resolved his “travesty,” as heat measured in the oceans and other parts of the Earth’s climate system now match the global energy imbalance from satellite measurements.\nThe oceans absorb over 90 percent of that trapped heat — a vast and accelerating amount. A UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on oceans and ice from this year concluded that during the mid-to-late 20th century, the oceans absorbed an amount of heat equivalent to the energy of two Hiroshima atomic bombs every second. Since 1993, the ocean heating rate has gone up to five atomic bombs per second.\nClick here to read the rest"

   "paragraph": "What it's like to be a mom in fire country\nPosted on 15 November 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Daisy Simmons\n“Can we go to the new playground?” my 6-year-old son Jude asks one day at after-school pick-up. It’s early November 2018 but still unseasonably warm in Northern California – perfect playground weather.\n“Of course!” I exclaim. I’m older than many of the parents around here, so I can be a bit of a try-hard when it comes to spontaneous fun.\nThe sky is sunny with puffy clouds. Jude is climbing on a spiderweb structure when I am startled by a stray comment from a parent by the swing set.\n“Paradise was wiped off the map this morning,” he says dispassionately, like he’s reading a stock chart.\nI have never heard of this fictional-sounding place, even though it turns out it is – was? – just 50 miles away.\nMaybe he’s talking about a role-playing game, I think, and get back to oohing and ahhing over Jude’s excitement over the too-safe carousel, the funny little hideout, the two-person swings.\nThe next day, a few parents are sitting at a picnic table outside Jude’s school, chatting as our kids dart between redwoods.\nNone of us really knows the others. These little sessions are still like a pop quiz of whose children should be friends, based on whose parents could maybe like each other. I shade my eyes from the too-bright sun as I watch Jude, the only boy in a group of girls.\nAs we talk, the air changes suddenly, like a storm is coming. The sky blackens and eerie shadows fill the playground. Smoke from the fire that destroyed Paradise is pouring into our river valley. A thick gray smear eclipses the sun, now a vague dot in the ash cloud.\nNo one speaks for a moment. One mom breaks the silence.\n“If the fire comes here – there’s only one way out of our neighborhood. What if a tree falls on the road?”\nAnother silence follows.\nThen each of us mutters something meant to be encouraging as we gather up our own and leave.\nA breathtakingly fast fire\nClick – “Fire Captain Says Wildfire Destroyed Calif. Town.” Click – “Father Sings to Three-Year-Old Daughter as They Evacuate California Fires.” Click – “Wildfire Growing at a Rate of About 80 Football Fields per Minute.”\nThe November 2018 fire in Paradise, driven by bone-dry vegetation, low humidity and high, northeasterly winds, was breathtakingly fast. It killed 85 people in a matter of hours.\nMany Paradise residents couldn’t or didn’t know to evacuate until it was too late. Others got out of their homes in time only to get trapped on a road blocked by fire.\nI can’t stop reading the news, picturing the people in these stories. It’s too easy to imagine my family in that situation.\nParadise is eerily close, and disturbingly similar, to our town – another small, sweetheart destination in the Sierra foothills, a peaceful place to raise children.\nI cling to small differences: We’re about a thousand feet higher in elevation, for example. But it’s not enough to keep me from waking up at night.\nAsh coats the roofs of our cars, our winter squash, Jude’s wagon. Persistent smoke prompts daily health warnings to stay indoors.\n“We had indoor recess again today,” Jude tells me.\nHis class collects donations for the kids who’ve been affected by the fire. The boxes fill up each day with toys, books, and clothes.\nOne day, we’re driving home from school, smoke still blocking from view the rolling hills beside us.\n“I don’t want there ever to be any more fires,” Jude says from the backseat.\nHis voice is calm but the words tear at me. In this moment I hate the beautiful home and life we’ve built here.\n“Oh, me neither,” I say with fake-calm camaraderie. “Unfortunately, though, there probably will be more fires in the future, so what matters is that we know how to be safe, and if we need to evacuate, we’ll do that. And we’ll be OK, because all we really need is each other and to be safe, which we will be!”\nThe smiley emojis are so clearly present in my speech that I almost convince myself.\nBut I don’t feel that full-throttle confidence, not really.\nParadise has broken that because at 41, I’ve learned that it doesn’t always matter whether you get out the front door in time. What matters is whether you can actually make it out of town.\nA secret escape plan\n“Are you guys going on a bike trip?” our neighbor asks.\n“No, I mean, yes. I mean, not that we’re really planning, but you never know,” I reply.\nThings are getting awkward. Our family likes to bike, so bikes on the back of the car aren’t all that suspicious.\nThe truth is I’ve been keeping the bikes locked on top of the hatchback (a pretty restrictive move – you can’t even open the trunk) because the thought of getting trapped in gridlock while fleeing fire has been keeping me awake at night.\nBut I’m trying to keep it a secret so that a) Jude doesn’t get traumatized by my neuroses (founded or otherwise), and b) our neighbors still think we’re rational, reliable people they can turn to in need. Not frantic types who overthink every possible way an evacuation could go awry.\nFortunately, now we actually are going somewhere, so I’m hoping we can stop worrying about bike racks and what the neighbors think of us.\nSoon after, we’re waiting at an airport shuttle stop, decked out in our N95s, ready to escape. Like many others have done lately, we snap an #airmask selfie. I tighten the metal clamp around Jude’s nose, but the gaps around his chin make the effort seem futile.\nWhen the bus arrives to whisk us away to the airport, I try to guess who’s coming or going based on whether they’re wearing a mask.\nWhen we arrive at my aunt and uncle’s home in the wonderfully wet North Carolina, we’re thrilled to hear it could rain all week. On Thanksgiving day, we offer thanks for the torrential, merciful, rains that we’ve heard are falling in our hometown, too.\nBy the time we head home, fire season is over, the rainy season has begun, and we can officially go back to our regular lives.\nFor a little while, at least.\nA new mother-son pastime\nI learn that, scary as it is, it’s natural for fire to happen here. Some of the area’s most wondrous species of flowers only germinate after there’s been a fire.\nBut climate change is causing tinder-dry conditions, hotter summers, and warmer winters across the Western U.S. Fire suppression and development that balloons into wildfire-prone areas are compounding the threat – to the point where fire “season” is no longer the right word for what this is. These days, it’s more like a marathon that runs from Memorial Day or so to, in some years, Thanksgiving.\nWhen spring arrives, I still feel haunted by what happened to Paradise. Late at night, I think about the doctor who said she’d always felt comforted by the thought that, if you were going to die in a fire, the smoke would knock you out before any flames could – until she was trapped in her car, surrounded by lightning-fast-moving fire, and saw why that would not be the case, here. And I think about the people whose lives were saved by a bulldozer driver who plowed a path of safety for them to escape and lost his life in the process.\nI get a text from a friend. “Yikes,” it says. It includes a link to a news roundup featuring California’s many fire-prone cities. Two hundred or so California towns have been officially designated as highly vulnerable to major fire. Our town didn’t just make the list – it’s highlighted as a prime NorCal example.\nI struggle to respond to my friend’s text. It’s not clear what we can do with that information. Should we move?\nIn Paradise, perhaps surprisingly, that question is still being asked. Few people even had homes to come back to. Those who did still face other challenges, like the fact that no one will insure their property or that they no longer have many neighbors. Still, some are rebuilding. The local paper is full of the high school sports teams’ news and practical information on which government buildings have reopened.\nFor now, many of the rest of us are staking hope in the efforts taking place all over the state to protect our communities from fire – like the $170 million in grants the state is giving out to help residents protect their homes by maintaining defensible space, a perimeter you keep clear of vegetation to help slow approaching fire and give firefighters a fighting chance to protect your home.\n“A weed-whacker? That’s a weird present.” Our 8-year-old neighbor smirks, his blond tangles bouncing in the light spring breeze.\n“Yeah, right?” my son agrees. His yearning to be like his older friend is plain as he shrugs away the Mother’s Day gift he himself helped pick out.\nLopping invasive species has become one of our favorite mother-son pastimes. Every time we clear a section of our gully, we talk about all the fun things he can now do in the space: more freely explore “Crystal Cove,” home to mystery rocks and tiny flakes of what may well be gold (this is Gold Country, after all). Discover new things like the apple tree we’ve never seen until now. Daydream about a treehouse where he is already plotting future sleepovers.\nWe haul the yard waste bin to the street. It’s staying light, later, but we’ve been so busy it’s dark by the time we head in for dinner.\nAfter staring dreamily into the dinner candles for a moment, Jude says in a sleepy voice, “Bodie can put his whole arm through a flame. Can you believe that?”\nA new normal\nNow it’s fall again and fire season has returned. “Don’t you love the power outage?” Jude asks a family friend who’s visiting for dinner. We’re dining al fresco on the porch, with our jackets on, because there’s more light outside than in the kitchen.\nWe’re in the dark after a high-wind forecast prompted utility PG&E to cut the power in our county and elsewhere, an outage that affects roughly two million people across the state. High winds like these, together with faulty electrical lines, sparked the fire that engulfed Paradise.\nJude’s school closes for three days in a row one week, two the next, and so forth – so far the school has clocked nine shuttered days in one month. This freedom to run around with the neighbor kids all day and stay up late thrills him.\nBut we grownups worry about what it means that these multi-day outages are becoming a new normal, one that lacks the infrastructure to support school, work, and the local economy. Many homes here rely on well water, which requires power to draw from, so you can’t even flush the toilet when the power is out, let alone put out a small fire should one spring up. The outages are also hard on people who live alone, particularly seniors and people who are sick. People are snapping at each other when they show up to work in dark, cold offices, at teachers who can’t help that school is closed, at restaurant servers who can’t take credit cards, and at other drivers in the darkened intersections.\nIt’s not going to be easy to get California out of this mess. It’s going to take systemic work to combat climate change and restructure the way we get and consume power. But for now, I like to think we’re doing some good by simply rallying around one another.\nOne night, we gather with the neighbors to march through the cold wind to one of the few downtown restaurants with a generator. The menu is limited – sorry, kids, no fries tonight – but the warmth in that room makes us all feel brighter. I pull Jude’s chair closer, pushing his hair behind his ears so I can see his eyes.\n“I love you,” I whisper-sing, kissing his forehead. “Love you too,” he says, wriggling out of my reach to get back to his friends and their paper airplanes.\nLater, as we’re walking home, the three boys run ahead of the parents, plunging into the dark without flashlights. They’re not unnerved by the pitch black sky; they’re exhilarated by its mystery and enchanted by its wondrous blanket of stars.\nAnd for this moment, I am too."

   "paragraph": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #45, 2019\nPosted on 12 November 2019 by doug_bostrom\nA telegenic thumb on the scales of perception\nKristin Timm reports on presentation habits of television weather forecasters, in AMS journal Weather, Climate and Society. \"Conformal comportment\" might be the label on the bucket of behaviors described in Timm's paper, but styles change with time— hopefully. Abstract:\nThe journalistic norm of balance bas been described as the practice of giving equal weight to different sides of a story; false balance is balanced reporting when the weight of evidence strongly favors one side over others—for example, the reality of human-caused climate change. False balance is problematic because it skews public perception of expert agreement. Through formative interviews and a survey of American weathercasters about climate change reporting, we found that objectivity and balance—topics that have frequently been studied with environmental journalists—are also relevant to understanding climate change reporting among weathercasters. Questions about the practice of and reasons for presenting an opposing viewpoint when reporting on climate change were included in a 2017 census survey of weathercasters working in the United States (N=480; response rate=22%). When reporting on climate change, 35% of weathercasters present an opposing viewpoint ‘always’ or ‘most of the time.’ Their rationale for reporting opposing viewpoints included the journalistic norms of objectivity and balanced reporting (53%), their perceived uncertainty of climate science (21%), to acknowledge differences of opinion (17%), to maintain credibility (14%), and to strengthen the story (7%). These findings show that climate change reporting from weathercasters sometimes includes opposing viewpoints, and possibly a false balance, but further research is necessary. Moreover, prior research has shown that the climate reporting practices among weathercasters are evolving rapidly and so the problem of false balance reporting may already be self-correcting.\nResults may vary\nWith last week's news that the US is withdrawing from The Paris Agreement, the article by Jenouvrier et al The Paris Agreement objectives will likely halt future declines of emperor penguins is as poignant as it is unfortunate in its publication timing. The removal of the largest economy in the world from the input assumptions of the work will surely upend the results. Given that the US has replaced defined objectives with vague assertions of unquantified ambition to be better, we can translate the US decision as a tacit retreat in the direction of \"business as usual.\" Th situation described in the abstract as it stood prior to the USA's breaking of faith naturally leads to implications:\nHere we project the dynamics of all known emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies under new climate change scenarios meeting the Paris Agreement objectives using a climate‐dependent‐metapopulation model. Our model includes various dispersal behaviors so that penguins could modulate climate effects through movement and habitat selection. Under business‐as‐usual greenhouse gas emissions, we show that 80% of the colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100, thus the total abundance of emperor penguins is projected to decline by at least 81% relative to its initial size, regardless of dispersal abilities. In contrast, if the Paris Agreement objectives are met, viable emperor penguin refuges will exist in Antarctica, and only 19% and 31% colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100 under the Paris 1.5 and 2 climate scenarios respectively.\nWere it not for the successful results of decades of deceit the article's conclusions might not have been superseded so swiftly and sadly.

   "title": "Top 10 most viewed rebuttals in September and October 2019",
   "paragraph": "Top 10 most viewed rebuttals in September and October 2019\nPosted on 11 November 2019 by BaerbelW , doug_bostrom\nWe recently posted about the Top 5 most viewed rebuttals during the month of October on social media and were surprised that the Facebook post garnered quite some reactions and managed to reach many people. So, here is a more detailed blog post also looking at September data which - most likely due to the \"Greta effect\" saw some interesting spikes and activities.\nLet's start with the ten most popular Skeptical Science rebuttals during October 2019:\nNote: this is based on views across rebutal versions where there can be up to three. You can access the rebuttals via these links consensus, impacts, past, meat, co2, sun, model, greenhouse, antarctica, and 1970s\nWhat does this tell us?\nAlthough Skeptical Science runs a semi-daily blog on matters of the science of anthropogenic climate change with a particular eye to impediments to climate progress, the site was invented and exists for the primary purpose of combating misinformation and disinformation about anthropogenic climate change.\nGiven our mission, Skeptical Science's main stock in trade consists of a few hundred articles written and maintained by Skeptical Science volunteers, examining various misconceptions about anthropogenic climate change and derived from peer-reviewed scientific research. These are usually presented in several levels of detail and complexity, allowing readers to get a quick synopsis and then seek deeper understanding if desired. Reflecting the site's reason for being, these standing items are viewed far more frequently than our blog posts.\nMany of our articles examine what can be classified as normal and expected misconceptions about climate change. It's a sad fact however that these fallacies are often so amplified via public relations campaigns or other channels that they are pushed across the border between misinformation and disinformation. There are also various objections to the concept of human-caused climate change that are pure invention, divorced from facts and (sadly) likely created solely for the purpose of paralyzing public policy responses to the climate problem we have created for ourselves.\nSkeptical Science is visited by several hundred thousand people per month, the vast majority arriving as the result of Google or other search engine queries leading them to our various rebuttal/debunking articles.\nHence the site's statistics serve as a kind of barometer of where public confusion about climate change may lie. The prominence of an article may change over time, an interesting thing to consider in terms of what that might say about the varying winds of public interest and understanding.\nSeptember 2019\nAt first sight, views for September don't look to be very different from October - until you check the Y-axis and realise that the \"consensus rebuttal\" was accessed over 75,000 times (compared to not quite 56,000 in October):\nSo, what happened during September which caused the view numbers to be considerably higher than usual? Your guess is as good as ours but if we had to bet, we'd place our money on the \"global week of climate action\" kicking off on September 20 with a huge global climate strike and followed by Greta Thunberg's \"How dare you?\" speech to world leaders on Sept. 23. This educated guess is corroborated if we look at the daily views across all rebuttals since January 1, 2019 (click for larger version):\nAnd before you ask: we don't know what caused the distinct negative spike shortly afterwards!\nOne of the - obvious - drivers for the positive spike was the consensus rebuttal which was accessed more than 4,000 times for both the basic and the intermediate version - even the advanced one saw a \"mini spike\" (clickfor larger version):\nWe'll leave it at that for now but would like to hear from you in the comments, if you'd like to see posts of this type regularly, perhaps once per month?"

   "paragraph": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #44, 2019\nPosted on 5 November 2019 by doug_bostrom\nOUP Bioscience statement on climate\nIt's normally the case that research scientists leave it to society to find the meaning and importance of their work to the world at large. Their activities are normally motivated by and confined to satisfaction of curiosity. Given that, the statement and evidence just published in Bioscience is quite notable, not least because the often fractious world of researchers has produced a declaration of urgency signed by some 11,258 practitioners from a wide diversity of domains. The World Scientists' Warning of a Climate Emergency is open access and includes a plethora of supporting data.\nBurning Paris\nThe conjunction of the Bioscience statement mentioned above with a newly confirmed development concerning governmental climate policy drips irony.\nAs the final net of this fishing trip bulging with new research results came inboard over the gunnels of the Skeptical Science research trawler, the Trump administration triggered the clock on the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. In a year, the largest economy on the planet will not be cooperating or pulling its weight on repairing our originally accidental but now arguably willful destructive rampage through Earth's various surface systems. This decision is so at odds with the reality we face as occupants and members of a closed space that speculating on why such a choice would be made inevitably leads to unflattering conclusions.\nToday's relatively few articles on the physical science and effects of our CO2 emissions and their web of supporting references alone seem amply galvanizing of attention and concern, but they're just a small school of fish from the enormous ocean of hard scientific research defining the urgent problem we're facing with climate. This fresh haul presents familiar proportions of species; there's an already-large and rapidly growing body of subsidiary research investigating how we might ameliorate our dilemma, how we can better understand and think about it, what it will cost to fix and how we can pay, and not least indicators of how all of this painstakingly accumulated intellectual mass and momentum might be synthesized and exploited to craft effective public policy to create a better future than what we're facing otherwise. Against all of that, we hear only \"no, I don't believe it\" with not-even-flimsy arguments in support of behaving and living as though we're more ignorant than we are. \"Inadequate\" hardly begins to describe the deficit of virtue and pride that could lead the US into such deviation.\nThe US could do better but the country's population is handicapped, inert beyond the norm. The country has been targeted by a prolonged, concerted stream of misinformation and disinformation promulgated by interests unable to see a horizon beyond the edges of a financial balance sheet. Thus the US has failed to develop the public awareness and public expression of urgency needed to foreclose such folly as just committed by the current administration. Deceit is costly as a matter of reality; misperceptions are not confined to the mental domain and as we see in this case may escape into the real world, to our peril.\nWhere's the remedy? When you hear something, say something. When you hear somebody repeating science fiction in place of science fact don't let them run aground— steer them to back toward reality.

The effects of this are nonpartisan in terms of their poor outcomes and hence a matter of neutral, natural inclusion in our content.\nHere’s How Science Has Suffered During the First 1,000 Days of Trump\nOne thousand days into the Trump administration, the federal government has attacked science 249 times—or roughly once every four days since the November 2016 elections.\nThe administration’s assault on science includes attempting to cast doubt on climate change, limiting and eliminating access to scientific information, and preventing federal scientists from publicly communicating their research.\nIn the Silencing Science Tracker, a public database we maintain with Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, we catalog government efforts to restrict, censor, undermine, and misrepresent science. We’ve defined these actions as those that aim to restrict or prohibit scientific research, education, or discussion, or the publication or use of scientific information.\nFederal entries in the Silencing Science Tracker broken out by agency\nOur analysis of Tracker data reveals where and how the Trump administration is focusing its efforts to silence science. The largest number of entries pertain to actions taken at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), constituting 23 percent of federal entries and the Department of Interior (DOI) at 18 percent.\nBut other agencies are not immune to attacks on science. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Department of Commerce (DOC)—the parent agency of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA)—are also well-represented in the Tracker.\nThis is a continuation of the trend we reported in January 2019, with different agencies represented at roughly the same rates as they were earlier in the year. It is worth noting actions to silence science are increasingly spread across a variety of smaller agencies or agencies typically less focused on scientific research, such as the Department of Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission.\nClimate science also remains the type of science most under attack, at 72 percent of Tracker entries. Other types of science affected include nutrition research, children’s health research, and endangered species listings.\nWhat’s new is that the types of government efforts to silence science have shifted considerably since the beginning of 2019. Reports of government censorship have risen to 39 percent of all entries, up from 26 percent in January. In fact, 65 percent of entries over the past three months—or 13 out of 20 entries—involve government censorship\nSilencing Science Tracker entries broken out by type of action\nThe reasons for these shifts are not clear but we believe, as others have observed, federal treatment of science and research has reached a “crisis point.”\nWhile all administrations are guilty of politicizing science to some degree, government attempts to silence science now happen more frequently and egregiously than ever, from the doctoring of hurricane maps to broadly dismantling federal scientific advisory boards.\nThe impacts of government attacks on science are dire and concerning. Public health is endangered when scientists are prohibited from speaking to the public; environmental resources are imperiled when scientific research is ignored, and sound policymaking is jeopardized when access to data is restricted.\nIf you’re a scientist who has experienced or witnessed attempts to silence science, or if you have legal questions related to your work, please contact us to arrange a free, confidential consultation with one of our attorneys."

   "title": "Ynyslas, western Wales – a place made by climate change",
   "paragraph": "Ynyslas, western Wales – a place made by climate change\nPosted on 31 October 2019 by John Mason\nYnyslas, on the Cardigan Bay coast of Wales, is a place well-known for its extensive, shingle spit-fronted sand-dunes, its hinterland of estuarine saltmarsh-flats and, seaward, its golden sandy beach, complete with a several thousand year-old submerged forest. The place gets some 250,000 visitors a year. Taking all of those factors into account, and that Ynyslas is also a direct product of actual climatic changes that occurred in the geologically-recent past, its tale was ripe for the telling, so that's just what I did. I wrote a book about it.\nThe Making of Ynyslas is a climate science book with a difference. It is an account of how climate change brought one well-loved modern landscape into existence, but in doing so, destroyed another. Covering the last 25,000 years, since around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, the story involves the details of deglaciation as the world's great ice-caps retreated polewards and seas rose, sometimes gradually and sometimes rapidly, by some 125 metres. In doing so, large areas of land were drowned: on a human time-scale, the changes would be permanent. On a geological time-scale, over hundreds of millions of years, the area now occupied by Cardigan Bay has variously been dry land or underwater on several occasions. In addition to climate change we have to consider the area's tectonic evolution over such lengthy time-frames, which are outside of the scope of the book, covering as it does the latest Pleistocene and the Holocene Stages of geological time.\nLumped together, these two stages make up the latter part of the Quaternary System, which began, following the Pliocene, 2.58 million years ago. The Quaternary represents a diversion away from the norm of the previous tens of millions of years, in that it featured regular and cyclic advances of ice-sheets, equatorwards from the Polar regions. For long stretches of geological time prior to the mid-Cenozoic, say from before some 35 million years ago, Polar ice was not a regular feature on the menu at all. So the changes from that climate state to the alternating glacials and interglacials of the Quaternary were, by definition, profound. But in order to understand how such changes came about, it is first necessary to look at past times when Earth has had an Icehouse climate. It's not a particularly common climate state over geological time and perturbations to the Slow Carbon Cycle have had a hand in every such switch.\nSuch changes have included the development of photosynthetic plantlife and the oxygenation of the atmosphere, at the expense of the methane that had once been common, in the early Proterozoic. Large eruptions of flood-basalt or the creation of new mountain-chains, at various times, have initiated enhanced weathering regimes. The greening of Earth's land-surface, from the first miniature and primitive land-plants in the Ordovician, to the luxuriant forests that had become widespread by the Carboniferous, again increased photosynthetic activity. All of these phenomena had one thing in common: they led to significant CO2 draw-down and a reduction in the overall greenhouse effect, thereby favouring cooler conditions.\nOf course, without us around to burn the fossil fuels, other sources of greenhouse gases were required to balance things in the other direction. Chief among these was volcanic activity. Sometimes, it may have been a slow but steady build-up of volcanogenic CO2; such was probably the case at the end of “Snowball Earth” episodes, when many CO2 draw-down routes were either not available or severely limited in their scope. If you cover most of Earth in ice-sheets, weathering becomes minimal; atmosphere-ocean gas exchange is mostly blocked and photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria find a lot fewer available niches to occupy. But volcanism is driven by much greater forces – movements within Earth's mantle and plate tectonics. It doesn't matter too much whether Earth has ice-sheets or not: for volcanoes it's business-as-usual. At other times, Earth has suffered shocks due to volcanism on an unimaginable scale, in which global warming and pollution were evidently involved. We covered the end-Permian mass-extinction and its demonstrable link to the catastrophic Siberian Traps volcanism in 2015, here and here.\nOnce the Slow Carbon Cycle has helped force a cool-down, other factors become important, too. The multi-thousand year Milankovitch Cycles affect the nature of Earth's orbit around the Sun and also the planet's own tilt on its axis: in an Icehouse climate, such things can affect seasonal sunlight input, to the extent that they permit advances and retreats of ice-sheets over long periods. Climate feedbacks are also important: for example, fresh snow covering sea-ice reflects 90% of incoming sunshine, but remove that ice, by whatever cause, and the open sea-water instead absorbs 94% of the solar energy.\nAbove - approximate extent of ice-sheets close to the Last Glacial Maximum: redrawn after consulting multiple literature sources e.g. Shennan et al. 2018. Annotation partially redone to adapt to image size limits.\nHaving looked at such things in detail, the scene is now set for the narrative itself. This is a tale involving a certain amount of Quaternary geology but also the nature of the beast that is sea level rise. We tend to think of the latter as a thing of the future, even though right now, spring tides are a cause for concern in many parts of the world, such as the Florida coast. A hundred and twenty-five metres of sea level rise is an awful lot. If our current fossil fuel-burning activities continue unabated, leading eventually to the melting of all ice on Earth, the seas would rise by \"only\" some 70 metres.\nAt the Last Glacial Maximum, a vast glacier occupied what is now the Irish Sea, reaching down beyond the Isles of Scilly towards the edge of the continental shelf. Yet its retreat was remarkably fast and it left in its wake an ecological blank slate, ripe for colonisation, for the great ice-caps of Scandinavia and America remained. Ice-caps have a lot of inertia when it comes to melting them. Because Cardigan Bay is so shallow – all of it is less than fifty metres deep – there was a considerable time when it remained ice-free yet land. Drill-cores extracted from boreholes out in the Bay have encountered, in various depths of water and at various depths beneath the sea-floor, beds of peat representing bygone forests that thrived at various points along this time-line. It was not until around 12,000 years ago that the seas began to invade this wooded plain and it took another six thousand years to bring the sea close to the modern coastline. The famous submerged forest on Borth-Ynyslas Beach, visible on low tides, is even more recent. The flooding thereby spans the period of time from the latest Palaeolithic through to the Neolithic: people were almost certainly present to witness the intergenerational drowning of what would have been fertile hunting-country, akin to the Doggerland of the North Sea.\nAbove - sketch-map of the Irish Sea, redrawn from nautical charts. The time represented here is close to the start of Meltwater Pulse 1A, a remarkably rapid phase of sea level rise over a number of centuries. However, at its start, sea levels were still some 100 metres lower than at present, so that Cardigan Bay would have been land, and would remain so for some considerable time to come.\nInterestingly, among the various Flood Legends that appear to have originated independently all around the world, Cardigan Bay has its own version. Cantre'r Gwaelod – the Lowland Hundred, was an ancient kingdom in what is now the Bay, complete with a settlement protected by sea-defences and sluice-gates. By various mechanisms (there are several versions), the gates were neglected on a night of storm and the sea poured in, ruining the place.\nI've long been intrigued by these flood-legends, arising in widely separate places (in terms of both physical distance and culture). Are they fragmentary memories of an eustatic sea level rise that continued relentlessly for generations, handed down via the oral tradition? It's interesting to speculate even when admittedly the evidence is likewise fragmented.\nAbove: the author at Borth beach, examining part of the Submerged Forest as the tide ebbs. Photo: Doug Bostrom.\nMore definite, though, is the fate awaiting the coasts of the world if we carry on recklessly burning the fossil fuels. The book finishes on this note because it is necessary to do so. Is Cantre'r Gwaelod 2.0 possible? The laws of physics say yes – and in this case the cause of the flooding will definitely be ourselves – if we do not act to change the way in which we live. Yet we are capable, given the correct tools, of diverting away from this destructive path, so the book ends on the hopeful note that this is indeed an option for us.\nThe Making of Ynyslas, the initial draft of which was helpfully reviewed by several fellow SkS team-members, is available from Coch-y-Bonddu Books, Machynlleth and via their website, cost £7.50 plus p&p:\nhttps://www.anglebooks.com/the-making-of-ynyslas-tales-from-an-area-the-size-of-wales-25-000-years-ago-to-the-present-day-by-john-s-mason.html\nAll around the world, there are places whose physical features directly reflect the changes brought about by deglaciation and eustatic sea level rise. Why not write about them? Tell us the story of your own back-yard and how drastically it was altered by climate change. Climate change can occur for various reasons although our reckless fossil fuel-burning has a certain uniqueness to it. But whatever the cause and however long the time-line, the effects are nevertheless profound and make the tale well worthy of the telling. Such accounts may, in turn, help people to finally understand what this is all about and why, while they go about their daily lives, others are striking from school or demonstrating in the world's capital cities in order to get the message across.\nReference:\nShennan, I., Bradley, S.L. and Edwards, R., 2018.

   "title": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #43, 2019",
   "paragraph": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #43, 2019\nPosted on 29 October 2019 by doug_bostrom\n62 articles, 11 open access\n[Late breaking]\nA few hours after \"finishing\" this edition of New Research, Nature Communications published a reassessment of SLR-driven coastal flooding hazards, New elevation data triple estimates of global vulnerability to sea-level rise and coastal flooding by Kulp & Strauss. The authors identify systematic problems with Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM (digital elevation model) data and DEM products based on the SRTM data product. This family of DEM products support key inputs into estimates of human populations and cultural features at risk from increased coastal flooding due to SLR. Given that Kulp & Strauss are proposing a substantial difference in affected population, we can be sure that this work will be closely attended not only in the popular press but by other researchers studying the same subject.\nClose to home\nIn their article The truth is not in the middle”: Journalistic norms of climate change bloggers, Christel W. van Eck and coauthors examine practices of climate change bloggers, comparing climate blogosphere journalism to more traditional news media. From the article introduction in Global Environmental Change:\nThe results show that climate change bloggers support the traditional journalistic norms of personalization, dramatization, novelty, authority and order, but not balance. Beyond the traditional journalistic norms, climate change bloggers identify contextualization, clarity, decency, and particularly truth as important journalistic norms. Truth is understood as a multi-dimensional norm comprising objectivity, transparency, and honesty. No differences are identified between norms supported by climate sceptical and climate mainstream bloggers, but each group operationalizes the norms differently.\nThe paper features many ships, crew and cargo familiar to those plying the climate blogging ocean. Beyond the immediate research results, the paper's backgrounding discussion is a fascinating look into a feature of human culture created almost entirely as a incidental effect of policy friction introduced by entrenched industrial interests. We're reminded by this article of how climate blogging has traditionally been most centrally concerned with arguing over the equivalent validity of \"2+2=4,\" with a tiny but dedicated group of variously motivated self-described iconoclasts dissipating energy, patience and time otherwise better employed elsewhere.\nA difference between traditional journalism and what we read in blogs emerges in van Eck et al: blog authors are less attached to the notion of \"balance\" as an overriding objective. In particular, we read that for bloggers not trading in science fiction, defying the laws of physics by attempting to synthesize \"balance\" where it cannot be found is subordinated to slavish devotion to reality.\nWe can also see that there's certainly more than a little dark absurdity woven into the fabric of the climate blogging world; quoted in the paper, Peter Sinclair is barely attaining hyperbole when he remarks “If one side of the issue is that the sky is blue and the other side of the issue is the sky is purple with pink polka dots, those are not two sides that deserve equal weight.” To be having the discussion implied by Sinclair's analogy is tragicomic but he's not really exaggerating the weird parameters of the conversation. There's no turning down the responsibility to counter comically silly arguments when those arguments pose a serious threat to obviously necessary changes and hence more or less we're all made fools, unavoidably.\nFading hostile environment?\nSwerving over to what might be termed \"operational journalism,\" in Reporting on climate change by broadcast meteorologists: A national assessment Kristin Tim et al report on television meteorologists' experiences and expectations of communicating climate change matters to their audiences, in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The paper denotes solid progress in this area, with broadcast meteorologists better equipped to communicate this important topic to viewers and increasingly doing so.\nA particularly interesting finding is that compared to their reportage a decade or more ago, broadcasters both fear this communication job less and do indeed find little reason to worry about negative feedback from viewers. Even so, a proportion of personalities still feel impelled to shrink back:\nMost weathercasters who had reported about climate change on air indicated they received either positive viewer feedback or little feedback (61.9%); conversely, weathercasters who had not reported about climate change expected to receive mostly negative feedback (44.2%).\nCranky remarks about climate change have long been a conspicuous feature in newspaper comment threads, to the point of being a joke. Given the enthusiasm and locally concentrated levels of participation in this activity we see, it intuitively seems the case that journalists and broadcast meteorologists may have found themselves conditioned to avoid talking about climate, being sure of facing a dismal stream of abuse whenever they raised their head above the parapet. It's encouraging to read evidence suggestive of this fringe activity being pushed ever farther to the edges of the Bell curve of likely hobbies to pursue. Perhaps we may one day be able to move on, secure in the knowledge that needful public policy isn't accidentally being shaped by understimulated and underinformed idlers seeking kicks.\nArticles:\nPhysical science of anthropogenic global warming & effects\nMarine Ice Cliff Instability Mitigated by Slow Removal of Ice Shelves\nRadiative effect of clouds at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, as inferred from ground-based remote sensing observations\nNorthern Hemisphere Stationary Waves in a Changing Climate (open access)\nObservation of global warming & global warming effects\nEnhanced El Niño‐Southern Oscillation variability in recent decades\nContribution of global warming and urbanization to changes in temperature extremes in Eastern China\nDevelopment of a sub-monthly temperature product to monitor near real-time climate conditions and assess long term heat events in the United States.\nGlobal trends of sea surface gravity wave, wind and coastal wave set-up\nDeclining U.S. Regional and Continental Trends in Intra‐annual and Interannual Extreme Temperature Swings\nCold waves are getting milder in the northern midlatitudes (open access)\nModeling global warming & global warming effects\nKilometer-scale climate models: Prospects and challenges (open access)\nEffect of climate change over landfalling hurricanes at the Yucatan Peninsula\nHow daily temperature and precipitation distributions evolve with global surface temperature (open access)\nA Speed Limit on Ice Shelf Collapse through Hydrofracture\nImpact of future warming and enhanced [CO2] on the vegetation‐cloud interaction\nDecline in Atlantic primary production accelerated by Greenland ice sheet melt\nUncertainty in the evolution of climate feedback traced to the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\nUnderstanding the atmospheric temperature adjustment to CO2 perturbation at the process level\nProjection of hydroclimate extreme indices over the Indochina region under climate change using a large single‐model ensemble\nPredicting future climate at high spatial and temporal resolution\nHumans dealing with our global warming\nReporting on climate change by broadcast meteorologists: A national assessment (open access)\nThe work after “It's too late” (to prevent dangerous climate change)\nIt's not too late to do the right thing: Moral motivations for climate change action\nRevisiting climate ambition: The case for prioritizing current action over future intent\nOn the political feasibility of climate change mitigation pathways: Is it too late to keep warming below 1.5°C?\nNever too soon, always too late: Reflections on climate temporality\nAdaptation to climate change in coastal communities: findings from seven sites on four continents\nPastoral yak rearing system is changing with change in climate: an exploration of North Sikkimin Eastern Himalaya\nFemale contribution to grassroots innovation for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh (open access)\nMicrobial insurgency: Theorizing global health in the Anthropocene\nPath independence of carbon budgets when meeting a stringent global mean temperature target after an overshoot (open access)\nAfforestation for climate change mitigation: Potentials, risks and trade‐offs\nCharacterising the biophysical, economic and social impacts of soil carbon sequestration as a greenhouse gas removal technology\nThe potential contribution of emerging economies to stop dangerous climate change.

   "title": "60 Years of Satellite Earth Radiation Budget Observations",
   "paragraph": "60 Years of Satellite Earth Radiation Budget Observations\nPosted on 28 October 2019 by doug_bostrom\n[Per remarks in comments below, a couple of corrections have been made to this article, to do with human employment of energy and Earth energy imbalance. It's always appreciated when readers with sharp eyes improve our work— thank you.]\n60 years ago this month the first direct observation \"Earth Radiation Budget\" experiment (ERB) was successfully lofted into orbit on Explorer VII, after a string of disappointing launch failures. This deployment was only the start of an increasingly sophisticated series of experiments intended to quantify and eventually monitor the ERB. In light of subsequent development it's an event worth commemorating.\n\"The primary purpose of the experiment is to measure the solar, reflected, and terrestrial radiation currents to obtain the radiant heat flow to and from the earth, and ultimately to obtain a clearer understanding of the driving force behind the circulation of the atmosphere.\" — Weinstein & Suomi, 1961\"\nBut first: what's the \"Earth Radiation Budget,\" or \"ERB?\" This describes the net gain or loss of solar energy to or from the Earth and its various surface systems. With a balanced radiation budget, Earth on average reradiates 100% of incoming solar radiation. Tiny changes in this budget (deficit or surplus) will necessarily exert profound effects on virtually every dynamic system on the planetary surface, including our cultural activities.\nIndeed— as accepted physics predicts— adding CO2 to the atmosphere as a side-effect of our cultural activities on Earth has introduced a slight imbalance in the radiation budget, somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.5-0.8 watts/square meter retained as a \"surplus\" and needing to be spent. This doesn't sound impressive in comparison with the 340 watts/square meter arriving from the Sun, but the surface of the Earth exposed to solar radiation is very large. Hence a lot of a little equals a whole bunch, several hundred terawatts of excess power being absorbed in warming the Earth's surface systems. By comparison, human manipulation of energy from all sources is about 18 terawatts.\nOnce the Earth's collection of systems has warmed sufficiently to radiate at the top of the atmosphere a little bit more powerfully— equal to the initial imbalance of concern— the ERB will again be in average equilibrium (\"balanced\" in accounting terms). It's the warming required to balance the radiation budget by stimulating increased radiation that is the root of our concern with anthropogenic climate change. That warming is dictated by increased net power delivery to Earth's surface systems, as reflected in the ERB at any given time.\nAnthropogenic climate change wasn't the impetus to launch the first ERB experiments. The investigators were more interested in improving weather forecasting and synoptic pictures of weather. Now and later— when we know the criticality of the ERB to understanding what we may expect of our emerging new climate— it's obviously helpful to have instrumentation in place to help measure the ERB directly. So it's serendipitous that from the earliest days of science by satellite and even when weight budgets were the subject of drastic and often brutal prioritization, development of Earth radiation budget measurement instruments was deemed highly important, giving us an ample head start on this activity.\nExplorer VII carried the first such experiment into orbit, an instrument devised by Vernor Suomi and Robert Parent and described thus in a contemporaneous NASA summary of radiation experiments:\nExplorer VII carried five hemispheric sensors in the form of hollow silver hemispheres. The hemispheres were thermally isolated from but in close proximity to special aluminized mirrors. The image of the hemisphere which appeared in the mirror made the sensor look like a full sphere. The spin of Explorer VIl made the mirror-backed-hemispheres act essentially as isolated spheres in space. Two of the hemispheres were provided with a black coating which made them respond about equally to solar and terrestrial radiation. One hemisphere was coated white, making it more sensitive to terrestrial radiation than to solar radiation. A fourth was gold-coated, making it more sensitive to solar radiation than to terrestrial radiation. The fifth hemisphere was tabor surfaced and equipped with a shade to protect it from direct sunlight. In addition, a black sphere was mounted on the axis of the satellite at the top. It was used to determine any deterioration in the mirror surfaces by comparison with the * blackened hemispheres. All temperature sensing elements were thermistors.\nThe information telemetered to the earth was the sensor temperatures. The long-wave and short-wave radiation values were obtained by using these temperatures in heat balance equations. Even though the Explorer VII sensors viewed the entire earth's disc , the effective spatial resolution was considerably reduced by geometrical considerations, i. e. , about 50% of the energy received at the nominal orbital height of 700 km originated within a radius of about 700 km from the subsatellite point.\nIn the illustration of Explorer VII above, two of the radiometer hemispheres are visible at the \"equator\" of the spacecraft. The mirror performance reference sphere is visible at the top, on a pole.\nAs a purely technical accomplishment at a time when our information about the space environment was extremely scanty, Explorer VII was a fairly astounding leap forward, carrying a plethora of other experiments along with Suomi and Parent's ERB sensors. The spacecraft remained more or less operational for nearly a year, a good performance at the time. It's hard to overemphasize the technical risk entailed and confronted in these early launches, especially given the paltry test and verification information and methods to hand. Explorer VII's power supply system alone was unprecedented in its ambitious use of photovoltaic cells in combination with nickel-cadmium batteries in an extreme environment.\nDuring Explorer VII's operational mission the ERB instrument functioned as intended, producing enough data to construct long-wave radiation maps such as the one shown below, depicting nighttime loss as \"isolangleys\"* (after Weinstein & Suomi 1961). This image is scanned from a contemporaneous print journal and hence not of the best quality.\nVariations of this instrument subsequently flew on TIROS operational weather satellites, with their last recognizable adaptation and deployment being on ESSA meterological orbiters. As \"spin stabilized\" satellites were superseded by spacecraft with more sophisticated attitude control systems, infrared radiometers moved to independently scanning instrument platforms and increasingly refined sensing methods.\nEven as Explorer VII has continued to silently orbit Earth in the years since mission end, our means to measure the Earth Radiation Budget has enormously improved. CERES as deployed on the appropriately named Suomi NPP satellite and other orbiters is exemplar of the current state of the art.\n*The term \"isolangley\" appears only to have been employed in this single paper, or so a literature search suggests"

   "title": "Talking about climate science at SAP TechEd in Barcelona",
   "paragraph": "Talking about climate science at SAP TechEd in Barcelona\nPosted on 23 October 2019 by BaerbelW\nI work in the IT-department of a German manufacturing company where I help maintain the company's installation of the SAP business software. SAP is a global IT-company headquartered in Walldorf, Germany. Each fall, SAP organizes a large technical conference - the TechEd - in Las Vegas, Barcelona and Bangalore. These events are comparable to scientific conferences, offering keynote speeches, lectures, hands-on sessions and vendor exhibitions all happening at the same time in different tracks. Several thousand participants come together each year at each of the three locations for three days to learn about many aspects of the SAP system we deal with on a day to day basis, or stuff we need to know for things to come.\nIn addition to working as a developer, I've also been active in the online SAP Community for several years, asking and answering questions and writing blog posts every once in a while. Therefore I was happy to be able to join SAP TechEd in Barcelona this year, which I could combine with a two weeks vacation at Spain's Costa del Sol. And while my husband and I flew to and from Malaga for our vacation (not having realized that it would have been possible - if timeconsuming - to get there by train), I decided to take the train from Malaga to Barcelona and back to at least not add another flight to my itinerary.\nBy now, I'm sure you are wondering why I'm writing about attending this conference as it doesn't really have anything to do with climate, right? Well, there are a couple of reasons to write about it. For one, SAP is trying to make the conference as sustainable as possible, by offsetting its CO2-emissions, including those incurred by the participants' travels (we were asked to fill out a questionnaire for that). For another, in Barcelona, they handed out reusable water-bottles which we could then refill everywhere at the venue and by doing so, contribute to the \"Fill-it-forward\" project. I also heard, that SAP decided to not have some of the large convention area laid out with carpet as that would have been thrown away after the 3-day event, causing a massive amount of waste which now was avoided.\nIn addition to the long planned conference program with its many sessions taking place in lecture halls and hands-on rooms, the SAP Community team for TechEd offered so-called \"Unconference meet-ups\" where participants could book a 30-minute slot at a table seating 8 people (or more!) to talk about a topic they were interested in. These sessions were then added to the official meeting planner so other participants could see them and add them to their personal agendas. Although I had read the blog post about these neat sessions in SAP Community, I hadn‘t been aware that they really could be about (almost) any topic and didn‘t necessarily need to be technical in nature (as most turned out to be). While chatting with Jerry, the unconference organiser, on Tuesday or Wednesday, he mentioned that I could even do one related to climate change. With that he – obviously! – had me hooked and he could fill another slot on his whiteboard!\nFor my meet-up session I had chosen the title \"Let's talk climate science in order to end climate silence“ - inspired by my similarly named discussion in SAP Community which I had started earlier this year. I didn‘t really know if anybody would show up for a climate chat at 9:30 on Thursday morning, so I was relieved once the first people took a seat and that we ended up with a full table of 8 to talk a bit about climate change. I kicked things off by explaining why I‘m deeply involved with the topic and we then touched on a couple of items In the 30 minutes we had available:\nSAP offsetting TechEd‘s CO2 emissions\nwhat the consensus among climate scientists is about\nwhy most people don‘t realize that the consensus is between 90 and 100 percent\nwhat individuals can do to help mitigate climate change\nresources like Skeptical Science or Project Drawdown where people can find trustworthy information\nI‘m really glad, that Jerry made me do this session and that he snapped a picture of the meet-up:\nPicture: Jerry Janda\nOffering this session on - almost - the spur of the moment makes for a good example of where an unexpected opportunity might present itself to talk with others about climate change. As I like to be prepared for such eventualities, I had even brought my \"climate scarf\" featuring Ed Hawkins warming stripes to Barcelona - and quite a good thing, that I did!"

   "paragraph": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #42, 2019\nPosted on 22 October 2019 by doug_bostrom\n54 articles, 18 open access\nWhen positives are a negative\nNature Climate Change highlights Susan Natali's Large loss of CO2 in winter observed across the northern permafrost region, observing:\nWarming in the Arctic is causing soils to decompose more rapidly, even during winter.

Saint‐Martin, Fast‐Forward to Perturbed Equilibrium Climate, remarking:\nThe Earth system responds on a range of timescales to a change in radiative forcing, and full equilibration takes centuries to millennia in many models. In their recent paper, [D.Saint-Martin et al] propose a technique for reaching a faster equilibrium temperature response to alternative CO2 concentration levels by briefly overshooting the desired concentration level to warm the deep ocean faster than a conventional step‐change experiment. Understanding how these timescales interact is essential for better representing the relationship between transient climate change and the warming which should be expected as greenhouse gas concentrations stabilize. But, the technique also raises new possibilities about how Earth System Models could be developed, and whether we could gain the capacity to spin up alternative model configurations such as perturbed parameter simulations or alternative control states to explore historical forcing uncertainty.\nCow tuning for a better tomorrow\nAdjusting input variables to dairy cattle so as to optimize for maximized milk output and minimized CO2 hoofprint is explored by Brandt et al with their Intensification of dairy production can increase the GHG mitigation potential of the land use sector in East Africa. The authors find that— according to their results— there is potential to significantly expand dairy production while distinctly shrinking both CO2 intensity and (less dramatically) overall emissions from this sector, while also reducing loss of forest productivity.

   "title": "A small electric plane demonstrates promise, obstacles of climate-friendly air travel",
   "paragraph": "A small electric plane demonstrates promise, obstacles of climate-friendly air travel\nPosted on 21 October 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Lindsay Fendt\nWhen the pilot guides the electric airplane from its hangar, there is only a light whirring of propellers instead of the roar of an engine. And it leaves no exhaust in its wake as it takes off from a small air strip south of Denver. The small plane, the eFlyer, is the first all-electric plane to seek FAA certification and its builders hope it will revolutionize the aviation industry as the first commercial electric airplane.\n“Electric motors are not new,” said George Bye, President of Bye Aerospace and the airplane’s creator. “But the application to airplanes is remarkable, and until recently most people thought it was impossible.”\nBye, who started working to develop the plane 12 years ago, said it took a transformation in battery and engine technology to make the eFlyer possible. While cars have long been able to carry heavy batteries and engines, airplanes must be aerodynamic and light. Bye completed his design once batteries and electric engines became small enough. The eFlyer is the first all-electric airplane to enter an FAA certification program, and the first eFlyers could take to the skies as early as 2021.\nTraining pilots, draining carbon\nBye initially designed the electric plane after learning of a growing commercial airline pilot shortage. He thought the eFlyer could cut down on expensive fuel costs for flight school training. But in addition to breaking down barriers to entry for new pilots, electric planes could one day make the aviation industry much friendlier to the environment.\nElectric airplanes ‘not only possible, but it’s revolutionary.’ – Bye Aerospace creator\nPersonal cars drive the conversation about transportation’s impact on climate change, but some estimate that an airplane flight could be 50 times worse for the climate than a car driven the same distance. Airplanes, like cars, release carbon dioxide, but each flight also releases nitrogen oxides, water vapor and particulates that can contribute to global warming. When released at high altitude these other emissions usually amount to more than half of a plane trip’s contribution to climate change.\nDespite the environmental impacts of aviation, the industry has been largely left out of the conversation about electric vehicles, primarily because of technological limitations. The FAA would not even consider electric airplanes for airworthiness until 2017. The eFlyer, though only a small plane for flight training, could start to change that conversation.\n“We are showing that this is not only possible, but it’s revolutionary,” said Bye.\nBig savings for flight schools\nFor flight schools the cost savings are big. Using Colorado prices, it takes about $3 worth of electricity for the eFlyer to make a flight that would require $50 worth of fuel. For commercial airline pilot training, that adds up to more than $70,000 in savings. If the plane is charged with renewable energy, it also cuts greenhouse gas emissions to zero.\nWhile Bye Aerospace is on schedule to be the first plane with FAA approval, other companies are also starting to make electric airplanes. Two battery-powered nine-seater concept planes – one all-electric and another hybrid – made appearances at this year’s Paris Airshow. The commercial aviation industry has started to grapple with its large contributions to climate change by forming CORSIA, a carbon offsetting scheme that promises only carbon-neutral growth in the industry after 2020.\nStill, both the technology and the aviation market are a long way from scaling-up to large electric jets. The four-seat eFlyer has a maximum fly time of only four hours, and batteries and electric engines get more expensive and heavier as they are scaled up. Though demand for green tech in aviation is expected to rise, according to Swiss investment bank UBS, mainstream airlines have resisted reforms, like taxation, that could fund a faster transition. Aviation has also been slow to adopt alternative fuels like hydrogen, pointing to high costs and a lack of regulation.\nNorway moving ahead on electric airplanes\nAs other companies start to catch on to the potential of electric planes, Bye Aerospace already has 604 entities that have expressed interest in the eFlyer either with a deposit, a purchase commitment, or an option. The Norway-based flight school OFM has a purchase deposit on 60 planes and intends to charge the planes on the country’s electricity grid that is powered almost entirely with renewables. Norway already has more electric cars than it does gas-powered cars and appears eager to extend that infrastructure to electric airplanes.\nWhile most of the eFlyer’s customers have been flight schools, Bye says the four-seat model of the eFlyer could be used for other things. The quiet plane would be ideal for flying low over dense urban areas without disrupting residents, he says. The lack of noise, combined with low cost and a low environmental footprint, mean that the eFlyer could one day be used for on-demand charter flights or courier services.\n“We are innovating with a purpose,” Bye said. “We are very happy to have an environmentally and technically interesting aircraft that also has a compelling benefit to the cost of flight.”"

   "title": "Canada's ClimateData Web Portal: Normal Science, Not Fake",
   "paragraph": "Canada's ClimateData Web Portal: Normal Science, Not Fake\nPosted on 17 October 2019 by David Kirtley\nIn August, the Canadian government launched a new website called ClimateData.ca which \"provides engineers, public health professionals, urban planners, mayors, and anyone else doing long-term planning with user-friendly climate change information, data, resources and tools\" (press release). The website uses past weather data from 1950-2011 along with computer modelling to project the possible future impacts of climate change in Canada. Françoys Labonté, the Executive Director of Computer Research Insititue of Montréal (CRIM), one of the developers of the new web portal, said the website's purpose is \"to provide Canadian leaders and managers with easy access to useful, actual and future climate data and information to assist them in anticipating and managing climate change-related issues over the medium and long term.\"\nFigure 1. The home page of Canada's new website: ClimateData.ca. Click for larger image.\nIt didn't take long for climate science denialists to notice the lack of weather data before 1950 and assume that Canadian government scientists must be up to something nefarious. Blacklock's Reporter was the first to claim, \"Canada omitted 100 years’ worth of weather data from a federal website intended to illustrate climate change.\" Their story is behind a rather expensive paywall (even for us AGW alarmists who are \"rolling in grant money\"). But the story was picked up by Toronto Sun journalist, Lorrie Goldstein, claiming that Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) \"omitted a century’s worth of observed weather data in developing its computer models on the impacts of climate change.\" James Delingpole blared from Breitbart that the ECCC \"has erased a century’s worth of observed temperature data, claiming its modelled computer projections are more accurate.\" Delingpole goes further in his conclusion:\nOthers less committed to green activism might find it somewhat sinister that the international agencies charged with maintaining the world’s temperature records are destroying them because the factual evidence doesn’t support the global warming scare narrative.\nThese wild claims about omitted, scrapped, erased, or destroyed historical weather data are completely false, and they are a total misrepresentation of the types of computer modelling used for ClimateData.\nExplaining ANUSPLIN\nOne reason weather data before 1950 was not used is because the data is too sparse—there were fewer weather stations pre-1950, especially in northern Canada. The purpose of ClimateData is to provide detailed climate information for all of Canada, including small towns and remote forested or mountainous areas far from any weather stations. The only way to get such information is to extrapolate from known weather records and use computer models to \"fill in the gaps.\"\nTo do this they used a software package called ANUSPLIN (Australian National University Spline). If Delingpole and Goldstein et al had read the \"About\" page of the ClimateData website they would have learned about ANUSPLIN and that \"Quality-controlled, but unadjusted, station data from the National Climate Data Archive of Environment and Climate Change Canada data (Hutchinson et al., 2009) were interpolated onto the high-resolution grid using thin plate splines.\"\nI contacted a media relations spokesperson at ECCC, Gabrielle Lamontagne, who said, \"Environment and Climate Change Canada has not removed or deleted any weather data in developing models on the impacts of climate change. The complete record of weather station observations is publicly available on the Meteorological Service of Canada’s Historical Data page.\" You can still access pre-1950 weather records.\nSo, no, data was not erased and replaced with fake data which shows more warming.\nThe use of ANUSPLIN is another reason pre-1950 data was not used. Lamontagne, explains: \"the data was calibrated using observational dataset (ANUSPLIN), which was only available from 1950. At that time, the weather station density across Canada, particularly in the northern regions, became dense enough for reliable gridded datasets to be created.\"\nA paper about ANUSPLIN (McKenney et al. (2011) Customized Spatial Climate Models for North America) gives more information about this type of modelling:\nIn forestry and many other sectors, there is often a need for estimates well away from meteorological stations, which tend to be clustered near agricultural and urban areas. This need is met by “spatial” climate models, which can provide estimates of climate at both specific locations of interest and in the form of regular grids. Projected climate change is another motivating factor in the development of these products. Spatial models of projected future climate allow these changes to be mapped, regional impacts to be assessed, and adaptation measures to be developed.\nThose last few sentences perfectly describe the role of ClimateData and why modelling using ANUSPLIN was fit for that role.\nMcKenney et al. further state: \"All spatial climate modeling begins with, and ultimately depends on, data from meteorological stations.\"\nSo, again, real-world weather records were used to generate more accurate models of Canada's climate for the second half of the 20th century.\nDetails from Downscaling\nANUSPLIN is a form of \"statistical downscaling\" commonly used in regional and local computer modelling. Most computer models used in climate studies (General Circulation Models, GCMs) are global in scale and their resolution (grid sizes of 100-150 km) is too coarse to give the finer details needed to show impacts at country, province, or city levels (grids of ~10km). To show these finer details statistical downscaling is used. Demystifying Climate Models defines statistical downscaling as a:\nmethod by which a statistical relationship is established from observations between large-scale variables, like atmospheric surface pressure, and a local variable, like the wind speed at a particular site. The relationship is then subsequently applied to GCM output to obtain the local variables from the GCM output.\nDownscaling climate models using Canada's weather observations provided ClimateData with models of Canada's climate over the second half of the 20th century. Models were then run into the future (to 2100) to illustrate what Canada's climate may be like under three different emissions scenarios. There is nothing sinister or deceptive about this. The only way to get information about what climate change may do to Canada during this century is to run computer models. And the best way to do that is to base those models on actual weather observations.\nCherry Picking Old Records and Confusing Weather for Climate\nBlacklock's Reporter, as well as the others who parroted their article, also complained that some Canadian weather records prior to 1950 were warmer than current temperatures. Here's an example from Goldstein's article: \"Vancouver had a higher record temperature in 1910 (30.6C) than in 2017 (29.5C).\" What is so special about those two years? Why not mention 1908 (33C), which had an even higher temperature than 1910? Or 2009 which had the highest recorded temperature for Vancouver at 34C? (Source.)\nDoes global warming mean that Vancouver must post new record high temperatures every single year? Of course not. These critics are confused about the difference between weather and climate. Comparing a single temperature record from some random year with that from another random year doesn't tell you much about climate or climate change, it is merely comparing one weather statistic with another weather statistic.\nFigure 2. Vancouver's hottest days, second half of the 20th century, now, and in three possible futures with global warming. From ClimateData.ca. Click for larger image.\nGabrielle Lamontagne, the spokesperson for ECCC, summed up these distinctions in the context of ECCC's role in communicating to the public about weather and climate:\nRegarding the use of observation data mentioned [in] the articles, according to Canada’s Changing Climate Report, between 1948 and 2016, Canada's climate has warmed by 1.7 °C for Canada as a whole, and 2.3 °C for northern Canada, with the strongest warming in northwestern Canada. This warming trend does not mean that the average temperature is higher in each successive year. As climate varies naturally, there have been and will be years that are warmer or cooler than previous years over the country, as well as different magnitudes in warming among regions. As a result, extremely high or low temperatures have occurred throughout the period of observational records, even though there is an overall warming trend across all regions. When Environment Climate Change Canada reports on past changes in hottest days or storms, ECCC’s experts do not use model data, only observation data. When Environment and Climate Change Canada wants to know if changes in hottest day temperatures have anything to do with global warming, ECCC’s experts compare the observed data with model simulations of the expected climate response to global warming.\nTwo Options\nAre Blacklock's Reporter et al. honestly confused about the difference between weather and climate, and the complexities of climate computer modelling, or are they just trying to use that complexity to confuse their readers? Whatever the case, whether it's misinformation or disinformation, their readers come away from their articles with a skewed understanding of climate science. Instead of an awareness of how scientists use weather data to inform their climate models, these readers come away with a false view that scientists are throwing out old data and replacing it with \"fake\" data.\nClimate science can be a confusing topic. It draws from just about every major field of science, so no one can ever grasp every detail about everything involved. Of course this is true for the general public, but it's also true for scientists. Full disclosure: before writing this post I had never heard about ANUSPLINE, nor did I know about computer model \"downscaling\" and how modellers can interpolate weather data into climate models. Fascinating!\nWhen faced with something new we have two options: 1) we can trust that what we are reading is an honest description of the novelty, or 2) we can dig deeper and try to learn more about the new topic. The readers of Blacklock's Reporter et al are given a specific view about Canada's new web portal which falsely implicates climate scientists in a fraudulent scheme. Readers may trust this view as reality, or if they are truly curious about climate science and honestly want to learn about the global warming effects in Canada (both now and in the future) they would do well to look closer at the ClimateData website and see where that may lead them."

   "title": "Brief overview of new IPCC report on oceans and ice risks",
   "paragraph": "Brief overview of new IPCC report on oceans and ice risks\nPosted on 14 October 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nOn the heels of its August special report on climate and land, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in late September published another special report, this one focused on oceans and ice.\nThis latest report was authored by 104 climate scientists from 36 countries and reflecting findings in 6,981 studies. It contains a wealth of information – its Summary for Policymakers alone runs 45 pages – but some of the key points can be summarized as follows:\nSea-level rise is accelerating because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting at an increasing rate;\nThe oceans, while still basic, are becoming more acidic, which will have serious consequences for coral reefs and shell-building marine species;\nThe oceans are warming rapidly, leading to more frequent marine heatwaves, which also damage coral reefs;\nResearchers are beginning to see more of the most intense hurricanes, those in Category 4 and 5, which in combination with higher sea levels and increased precipitation pose increasing risks and damages to coastlines;\nMelting of permafrost could become a major feedback, adding carbon emissions and global warming in energy scenarios with significant continued fossil fuel burning;\nOcean oxygen levels are declining, which in combination with rising temperatures drives marine species away from the equator toward the poles, and, in concert with algal blooms, could lead to reduced seafood catches at fisheries.\nSea-level rise is accelerating\nThe claim that sea-level rise is not accelerating has long been a popular myth among those challenging climate science. Measurement data indeed are noisy, making it difficult to detect a change in the rate at which the oceans are rising, but some recent studies have been able to detect an acceleration. The IPCC report confirms this conclusion, noting with high confidence that “Areas of concern in earlier IPCC reports, such as the expected acceleration of sea-level rise, are now observed.”\nThat acceleration is primarily the result of faster melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Over the past decade, the amount of ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet has doubled as compared with the rate during the previous decade, and ice loss from Antarctica has tripled. The IPCC report concluded that if the world meets the Paris Climate Agreement target of no more than a 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) warming, sea-level rise could increase by 1-2 feet by 2100 and by a total of 3 feet by 2300; in a worst case high-emissions scenario, sea level would increase by 3 feet by 2100 and by 12 feet by 2300.\nAntarctic ice in particular poses substantial uncertainties in terms of future sea-level rise. The West Antarctic ice sheet alone has enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 10 feet, and recent studies have concluded that a large section of that ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat. Another recent study found that delaying by just five years reaching the threshold of peak carbon emissions will add about 8 inches to sea-level rise, mostly as a result of Antarctic melting.\nExtreme sea level events caused by long-term sea-level rise, in combination with factors like wind-driven storm surges or tides, currently tend to be once-per-century events, but research indicates they will become more commonplace. In many low-lying megacities and small islands, such events are projected to occur annually by 2050. Risks in some areas can be lessened by slowing global warming and using adaptation technologies, but the IPCC report notes that these can cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars every year.\nOcean acidification – global warming’s evil twin\nWhile human emissions of carbon cause global warming by increasing the atmospheric greenhouse effect, about 25-30% of global carbon emissions are absorbed by the oceans, resulting in a chemical reaction that creates carbonic acid and decreases ocean water pH.\nThe IPCC report notes that carbon pollution so far has decreased the average ocean pH from 8.2 to 8.1, which, because of its logarithmic scale, means the oceans are 25% more acidic than before the Industrial Revolution. By meeting the Paris Climate Agreement target of 2 degrees C, the world could limit the ocean acidification to 40%; but in a worst case high-emissions scenario, the oceans could become 150% more acidic than they were in 1850.\nThe IPCC report notes that even if the Paris target could be reached, “Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions … These declines in coral reef health will greatly diminish the services they provide to society, such as food provision, coastal protection, and tourism.” High-emissions scenarios also pose a significant risk to other shell-forming species as a result of rising ocean acidification. But particularly vulnerable as a result of a one-two punch of ocean acidification and higher water temperature are coral reefs, among the most diverse ecosystems in the world and a critical source of food and habitat for about 25% of the ocean’s fish. Fishery maximum catch potential has declined 4% so far, and research indicates it will fall by another 6% even if the 2 degree C target is met … and could see a roughly 20% drop in a worst case high-emissions scenario.\nRapid ocean heating and stronger hurricanes\nMore than 90% of overall global warming goes into the oceans. In the mid-to-late 20th Century, the world’s oceans every second were absorbing heat at a rate equivalent to the energy of two Hiroshima atomic bombs. Since 1993, the rate is comparable to more than five atomic bombs per second. This increase is leading to more marine heatwaves, which are already twice as frequent as they were in the early 1980s and are “negatively impact[ing] marine organisms and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades.”\nIf the Paris agreement 2 degrees C target is somehow achieved, the IPCC report anticipates that by the end of this century there will be 20 times more marine heatwaves than in the late-19th Century. But in a worst case high-emissions scenario, they could become 50 times more frequent. These high ocean temperature events stress many marine species and, again, especially coral reefs, leading to coral bleaching.\nHigh ocean temperatures will also fuel stronger hurricanes, which the IPCC report notes have been getting more intense. While it’s difficult to predict how the overall frequency of hurricanes will change in a warmer world, the research reviewed by the IPCC authors projects that the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes, the strongest categories, will increase. With increasing coastal populations, higher sea levels, bigger storm surges, and more intense precipitation, the forecast is for more damage from coastal flooding associated with hurricanes.\nMelting permafrost carbon feedback and risk mitigation\nThe IPCC report notes that worldwide permafrost contains about twice as much carbon as is currently in Earth’s atmosphere, and it’s beginning to thaw in some places. Meeting the Paris 2 degrees C target, which many experts consider unlikely, would still result in about a 25% loss of permafrost, and to a loss closer to 70% in a worst-case scenario. In that high-emissions scenario, thawing permafrost could lead to a “release of tens to hundreds of billions of tons of permafrost carbon as CO2 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100 with the potential to exacerbate climate change.” For comparison, humans currently release about 10 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere every year, so this feedback could be equivalent to adding decades’ worth of human carbon emissions into the atmosphere if fossil fuel use continues unabated.\nThere is substantial uncertainty about the amount of permafrost thaw and carbon release that will happen in these scenarios, but that’s a key take-home point for the public and policymakers from this report: Even if the world somehow meets the Paris targets, the outlook is for significant adverse impacts in the form of coral reef decline and damages to associated marine ecosystems. Expert research reviewed by the IPCC authors cautions of a reduction in fishery catches that will “elevate the risk to nutritional health in some communities highly dependent on seafood.” Hurricanes and coastal flooding will become worse as the oceans keep warming and rising, and there’s an increasing risk of very large sea-level rise associated with potential ice sheet collapse.\nThe more the world warms beyond the Paris Climate Agreement threshold of 2 degrees C, the greater these risks become. The IPCC report is best viewed as a risk assessment document: The slower the transition away from fossil fuels, the greater the risks of triggering negative, and in some cases potentially catastrophic, outcomes. The scientists look to policy makers to determine how best to manage and reduce those risks by reducing carbon emissions and curbing their damages through adaptation measures."

That would greatly increase the price of fossil-fuel-based energy — especially from the burning of coal — but the economic disruption could be offset by routing the money raised straight back to citizens.\n“If you compare the average level of the carbon tax today, which is $2 [a ton], to where we need to be, it’s a quantum leap,” said Paolo Mauro, deputy director of the fiscal affairs department at the IMF.\nThe world needs a massive carbon tax in just 10 years to limit climate change, IMF says by Chris Mooney & Andrew Freedman, Climate & Environment, Washington Post, Oct 10, 2019\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\nSun Oct 6, 2019\nAir France Increases Carbon Emissions Offsets to 100% by Alyssa Danigelis, Environment + Energy Leader, Oct 3, 2019\nIn an era of climate change, a phrase in the Jewish High Holidays liturgy takes on new meaning by Michael Leifman, Religion, Washington Post, Oct 4, 2019\nFor the children's sake, do something about climate change by Greg Weeks, Faith Perspectives, St Louis Dispatch, Oct 5, 2019\n‘Utter hypocrisy’: Government refuses to stop spending billions on fossil fuel projects across world by Chis Baynes, Environment, The Independent (UK), Oct 3, 2019\nNext EU energy chief backs gas as part of climate transition by Chloé Farand, Climate Home News, Oct 4, 2019\nAs Amazon Fires Burn, Pope Convenes Meeting on the Rainforests and Moral Obligation to Protect Them by Georgina Gustin, Inside Climate News, Oct 6, 2019\nHow Scientists Finally Got Americans to Worry About the Climate, Opinion by Faye Flam, Technology & Ideas, Bloomberg News, Oct 1, 2019\nNo Mention of Climate Change in the U.S. National Drought Resilience Partnership by Marc Kodack, The Center for Climate & Security, Oct 2, 2019\nMon Oct 7, 2019\nWater resources minister 'totally' accepts drought linked to climate change by Katharine Murphy, Environment, Guardian, Oct 5, 2019\nU.N. agency weighs options for long-term plane emissions goal, faces China pushback by Allison Lampert, Reuters, Oct 4, 2019\nChristian climate protestors to turn Lambeth Bridge into 'Faith Bridge', Ekklesia, Oct 5, 2019\nRiver Flows All Across the Globe Are Dropping by Eric Roston, Climate Changed, Bloomberg News, Oct 2, 2019\nSuper Typhoon Hagibis may become strongest storm on Earth, The Weather Network, Oct 7, 2019\nIf warming exceeds 2°C, Antarctica’s melting ice sheets could raise seas 20 metres in coming centuries by Georgia Rose Grant & Timothy Naish, The Conversation US, Oct 2, 2019\nIn the Mountains, Climate Change Is Disrupting Everything, from How Water Flows to When Plants Flower by Bob Berwyn, InsideClimate News, Oct 7, 2019\nThe Northeast US has a carbon-trading system.

   "title": "How the Greenland ice sheet fared in 2019",
   "paragraph": "How the Greenland ice sheet fared in 2019\nPosted on 7 October 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief\nDr Ruth Mottram, Dr Martin Stendel and Dr Peter Langen are climate scientists at the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) in Copenhagen, which is part of the Polar Portal. Dr Andreas Ahlstrøm and Dr Kenneth D. Mankoff are chief research consultant and senior scientist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, respectively.\nAs the end of August sees summer shift into autumn for the northern hemisphere, it also marks the end of the melt season for the Greenland ice sheet.\nThe advent of a new season is the traditional time for our annual look back at the year gone by and what it tells us about the state ice sheet.\nOur estimates show that the surface of the ice sheet gained 169bn tonnes of ice over 2018-19 – this is the seventh smallest gain on record.\nAnd using new satellite data, we show that – once all ice sheet processes are factored in for the past year – the Greenland ice sheet saw a net decline of 329bn tonnes in ice.\nSurface processes\nWhile western calendars show another four months before a new year, scientists generally consider the beginning of September as the start of a new annual cycle for the Greenland ice sheet.\nThis yearly pattern sees the ice sheet largely gain snow from September, accumulating ice through autumn, winter and into spring. Then, as the year warms up into late spring, the ice sheet begins to lose more ice through surface melt than it gains from fresh snowfall. This melt season generally continues until the end of August.\nThe contrast between snow gains and ice losses at the surface over the whole year is known as the “surface mass balance” (SMB). The chart below shows the SMB for 2018-19 on individual days (top) and cumulatively across the year (bottom). The blue lines show 2018-19 data and the grey line shows the long-term average. The lower chart also shows the record low year in 2011-12 (red line) for comparison.\nDaily (upper chart) and cumulative (lower) surface mass budget of the Greenland ice sheet, in billion tonnes per day, and billion tonnes, respectively. Blue lines show 2018-19 SMB year; the grey lines show the 1981-2010 average; and the red line in lower chart shows the record low SMB year of 2011-12. Credit: DMI Polar Portal.\nThis year has been an unusual one. It has been consistently drier than normal, which is reflected in the below-average gains in snow throughout the year. And the summer has been warm with some periods of very high melt.\nOverall, while the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons saw above-average gains in ice at the surface, the SMB in 2018-19 ends as the seventh lowest on record. The total accumulated SMB was only 169bn tonnes at the end of the year. This means that nine of the Top 10 lowest SMB years have occurred in the last 13 years in our record that goes back to 1981.\nTotal losses\nIt is important to remember that SMB is always positive at the end of the year – more snow falls on the ice sheet than melts at the surface. But the ice sheet also loses ice by the breaking off, or “calving”, of icebergs and from ocean melting at its edge. Therefore, the extra snowfall is needed in order to compensate for these processes.\nObservations collected by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite measure ice velocity of outlet glaciers around the edges of the ice sheet. By measuring how quickly the ice moves into the ocean we can work out how much ice is being lost by calving and ocean melting.\nOn average between 1986 and 2018, the ice sheet discharges about 462bn tonnes per year. This year our analysis suggests Greenland discharged around 498bn tonnes of ice.\nFactoring in these additional processes, we can calculate the total mass budget for the ice sheet for the year. For 2018-19, we estimate the ice sheet has seen a total net ice loss of around 329bn tonnes.\nData from the GRACE satellites indicate that Greenland lost an average of approximately 260bn tonnes of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, with a peak of 458bn in 2012. Clearly, the loss of 329bn tonnes we estimate this year is significantly above the 260bn tonne long-term average, but we have not broken the highest record for ice loss in a year.\nLong, dry summer\nThe high losses this year were from a combination of factors. The SMB year started in September 2018 with a long dry period – a much drier than usual winter over most of Greenland (only the south-east had more snow than usual). This left the ice sheet with only a thin protective cover that melted quickly in the lower areas when the melt season got going on the 30 April.\nIn fact, 2019 saw the second earliest start to the melt season on record – after 2016 – when an unusual spike in melting occurred in early April. The summer that followed was very long, dry and warm, with substantial melting all over the ice sheet and especially in the west and north.\nThe map below shows how the SMB at the end of the 2018-19 season compared with the long-term average. The shading indicates higher (blue) and lower (red) gains in ice than usual over the year. You can see that the majority of the ice sheet gained less ice than average.\nMap showing the difference between the annual SMB in 2018-19 and the 1981-2010 period (in mm of ice melt). Blue shows more ice gain than average and red shows more ice loss than average. Credit: DMI Polar Portal.\nWeather stations in the Programme for the Monitoring of the Greenland Ice sheet (PROMICE) network recorded ice loss rates in excess of the 2008-18 average at every one of its 21 locations across the ice sheet.\nWe saw large losses in north-west Greenland, for example. Weather stations managed by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) – which are located off the ice sheet, but with longer records – also showed well above average temperatures at all locations in June and July (August data is still being quality controlled).\nAutomatic weather station at TAS-L near Isortoq in SE Greenland 3 May, 2019. Credit: Photo: Andreas Ahlstrøm, GEUS\nMelt spike\nThe effects of the long warm summer were boosted in early June and again at the end of July by waves of warm air passing over the ice sheet and giving an extra push to the melt season.\nAt the peak of the second heatwave, our model calculated that the Greenland ice sheet lost 31bn tonnes of ice – equivalent to about 0.1mm of global sea level rise – in the three days from 31 July to 2 August. An average day during that period would see around five billion tonnes of ice melt.\nYou can see this spike in melt in the chart below, which shows the percentage area of the ice sheet that is melting on each day of the 2019 calendar year so far (blue line). It peaked this year at 58% on 1 August. The map above it shows the areas of the ice sheet melting on this day (shaded red).\nTop: Map showing areas of Greenland undergoing surface melt on 1 August 2019 (shaded red). Bottom: Chart showing percentage of ice sheet area seeing surface melt on each day of 2019 (blue line). The grey line shows the 1981-2010 average. Credit: DMI Polar Portal.\nFor comparison, the record summer melt season of 2011-12 had several similar large heatwaves – although these were more extreme with a larger surface area being affected and even higher peak temperatures at the ice sheet summit.\nHowever, 2018-19 was another year – and only the seventh occasion in a record going back 2,000 years – where surface melt was recorded at the summit. It really is very unusual to see melting at the summit.\nNegative phase\nThe long dry summer experienced this year was partly down to a very persistent negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but was also boosted by the underlying human-caused warming of the global climate.\nThe NAO is a source of variability over the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterised by a pattern of high atmospheric pressure over the Azores and low pressure over Iceland. The relative strengths of these two pressure systems drives the path of storms across the Atlantic. The NAO is therefore particularly important for northern Europe weather: a positive NAO generally brings mild, rainy, windy and grey weather – particularly in winter – while a negative index generally drives storms further south.\nAs well as steering rain and snow away from Greenland, a negative NAO also generally brings clear skies and few or thin clouds that helps to promote high melt rates. Several studies in recent years have shown how important the negative NAO is for high melt summers in Greenland. And in a new paper this year, we show that the past few lower melt summers – which resulted in a deceleration in ice loss from Greenland – were largely due to more positive NAO months.\nHowever, we emphasised in that study that we cannot expect a positive NAO every summer and the background warming of the planet emphasises the negative years more, as indeed the persistent negative NAO this summer has shown.\nGiven that the annual SMB in any given year is very much a response to individual weather events, and the NAO index plays a large role in steering this, it is important that global climate models capture it correctly.\nUnfortunately, while they mostly do a reasonable job, only a few of the current generation models – run as part of the CMIP5 project that fed into the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013 – seem able to show the kind of persistence in negative or positive NAO patterns that we observe.\nIn turn, this means that CMIP5 global climate models tend to underestimate the amount of melt likely to occur at present or in the future. It remains to be seen whether the updated models in CMIP6 – which will feed into the IPCC’s sixth assessment report in 2021 – will perform better.\nSurface albedo\nTo understand why and how the NAO directly contributes to ice sheet melt requires understanding of how we and other scientists actually calculate SMB.\nIn the past, estimates based on rainfall gauges and temperature observations – usually from weather stations near but not actually on the ice sheet – were made and then extrapolated over a wider area. These days we use a physical approach known as a “surface energy budget method”. This involves adding up all the incoming and outgoing energy for the ice sheet surface – with the difference between them giving an estimate of how warm the surface is.\nOne of the key influences on the outgoing energy is how much sunlight is reflected by the bright white snow on top of the ice sheet – a measure known as “albedo”. This summer has seen record lows of albedo – which means the surface is reflecting energy much less than average over large areas.\nThis is due to the long melt season allowing dust and sediment to accumulate on the surface and acting as ideal growing conditions for the dark-coloured algae and bacteria that we now know contribute significantly to darkening the ice sheet surface every summer. This means that clear skies and large amounts of sunlight – a characteristic of a negative NAO – will significantly increase the amount of melting."

They are accustomed to talking about climate change, but typically such talk amounts to ritual invocations of “urgency” coupled with promises about what might be achieved in 2030 or 2050.\nWhen your house is on fire, though, you don’t promise results in a decade or a year or a week. You grab a bucket and find some water. Immediately.\nWhen it comes to climate policy, Thunberg has it right. We are in a unique historical moment; we understand the danger of climate change and, for now, still have the resources and political space necessary to address it. But every second of delay makes the challenge more expensive, more difficult, and more dangerous.\nIt’s not just climate activists saying that. The policy community is moving in that direction as well, with similar arguments coming into clearer view from economists and political scientists.

   "paragraph": "Landmark United in Science report informs Climate Action Summit\nPosted on 2 October 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from the WMO\nThe world’s leading climate science organizations have joined forces to produce a landmark new report for the United Nations Climate Action Summit, underlining the glaring – and growing – gap between agreed targets to tackle global warming and the actual reality.\nThe report, United in Science, includes details on the state of the climate and presents trends in the emissions and atmospheric concentrations of the main greenhouse gases. It highlights the urgency of fundamental socio-economic transformation in key sectors such as land use and energy in order to avert dangerous global temperature increase with potentially irreversible impacts. It also examines tools to support both mitigation and adaptation.\n“The Report provides a unified assessment of the state of our Earth system under the increasing influence of anthropogenic climate change, of humanity’s response thus far and of the far-reaching changes that science projects for our global climate in the future. The scientific data and findings presented in the report represent the very latest authoritative information on these topics,” said the Science Advisory Group to the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.\n“It highlights the urgent need for the development of concrete actions that halt the worst effects of climate change.”\nThe Science Advisory Group is co-chaired by WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas and Leena Srivastava, former Vice Chancellor of TERI School of Advanced Studies. It comprises highly recognized and respected natural and social scientists, with expertise in different aspects of climate change, including on mitigation and adaptation.\nThe report, which was coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization, aims to present a “transparent envelope” of authoritative and actionable cutting-edge science.\nThe synthesis report consists of short summaries from contributing agencies: the World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO), Global Atmosphere Watch, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Global Carbon Project, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Future Earth, Earth League and the Global Framework for Climate Services. The synthesis is complemented by longer, individual reports, presented as a package to a high-level science event on 22 September and then to world leaders at the Climate Action Summit on 23 September.\nHighlights from the report include:\nThe Global Climate in 2015-2019\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO)\nWarmest five-year period on record\nThe average global temperature for 2015–2019 is on track to be the warmest of any equivalent period on record. It is currently estimated to be 1.1°Celsius (± 0.1°C) above pre-industrial (1850–1900) times. Widespread and long-lasting heatwaves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socio-economic development and the environment.\nContinued decrease of sea ice and ice mass\nArctic summer sea-ice extent has declined at a rate of approximately 12% per decade during 1979-2018. The four lowest values for winter sea-ice extent occurred between 2015 and 2019.\nOverall, the amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold between 1979 and 2017. Glacier mass loss for 2015-2019 is the highest for any five-year period on record.\nSea-level rise is accelerating, sea water is becoming more acidic\nThe observed rate of global mean sea-level rise accelerated from 3.04 millimeters per year (mm/yr) during the period 1997–2006 to approximately 4mm/yr during the period 2007–2016. This is due to the increased rate of ocean warming and melting of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets. There has been an overall increase of 26% in ocean acidity since the beginning of the industrial era.\nRecord Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere\nWMO Global Atmosphere Watch\nLevels of the main long-lived greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4)) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have reached new highs.\nThe last time Earth’s atmosphere contained 400 parts per million CO2 was about 3-5 million years ago, when global mean surface temperatures were 2-3°C warmer than today, ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica melted, parts of East Antarctica ice had retreated, all causing global see level rise of 10-20m compared with today.\nIn 2018, global CO2 concentration was 407.8 parts per million (ppm), 2.2 ppm higher than 2017. Preliminary data from a subset of greenhouse gas monitoring sites for 2019 indicate that CO2 concentrations are on track to reach or even exceed 410 parts per million (ppm) by the end of 2019.\nIn 2017, globally averaged atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were 405.6 ±0.1 ppm, CH4) at 1859 ±2 parts per billion (ppb) and N2O at 329.9 ±0.1 ppb. These values constitute, respectively, 146%, 257% and 122% of pre-industrial levels (pre-1750).\nThe growth rate of CO2 averaged over three consecutive decades (1985–1995, 1995–2005 and 2005–2015) increased from 1.42 ppm/yr to 1.86 ppm/yr and to 2.06 ppm/yr\nGlobal Carbon Budget\nGlobal Carbon Project\nCarbon dioxide emissions grew 2% and reached a record high of 37 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2018. There is still no sign of a peak in global emissions, even though they are growing slower than the global economy.\nCurrent economic and energy trends suggest that emissions will be at least as high in 2019 as in 2018. Global GDP is expected to grow at 3.2% in 2019, and if the global economy decarbonized at the same rate as in the last 10 years, that would still lead to an increase in global emissions.\nDespite extraordinary growth in renewable fuels over the past decade, the global energy system is still dominated by fossil fuel sources. The annual increase in global energy use is greater than the increase in renewable energy, meaning the fossil fuel use continues to grow. This growth needs to halt immediately.\nThe net-zero emissions needed to stabilize the climate requires both an acceleration in use of non-carbon energy sources and a rapid decline in the global share of fossil fuels in the energy mix. This dual requirement illustrates the scale of the challenge.\nNatural CO2 sinks, such as vegetation and oceans, which remove about half of all emissions from human activities, will become less efficient at doing so. This underscores the need to reduce deforestation and expand natural CO2 sinks, particularly those in forests and soils that can be improved by better management and habitat restoration.\nThe emissions gap – where we are and where we need to be\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\nThe UNEP Emissions Gap Reports, with the tenth edition being published this November, assess the latest scientific studies on current and estimated future greenhouse gas emissions; they compare these with the emission levels permissible for the world to progress on a least-cost pathway to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between “where we are likely to be and where we need to be” is known as the emissions gap.\nGlobal emissions are not estimated to peak by 2030, let alone by 2020, if current climate policies and ambition levels of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are maintained. Preliminary findings from the Emissions Gap Report 2019 indicate that greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in 2018.\nThe emissions gap in 2030 between emission levels under full implementation of conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and levels consistent with least-cost pathways to the 2°C target is 13 GtCO2e. If just the unconditional NDCs are implemented, the gap increases to 15 GtCO2e. The gap in the case of the 1.5°C target and 2°C target is 29 GtCO2e and 32 GtCO2e respectively.\nCurrent NDCs are estimated to lower global emissions in 2030 by up to 6 GtCO2e compared to a continuation of current policies. This level of ambition needs to be roughly tripled to align with the 2°C limit and must be increased around fivefold to align with the 1.5°C limit.\nImplementing unconditional NDCs, and assuming that climate action continues consistently throughout the twenty-first century, would lead to a global mean temperature rise between 2.9°C and 3.4°C by 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels.\nIf NDC ambitions are not increased immediately and backed up by action, exceeding the 1.5°C goal can no longer be avoided. If the emissions gap is not closed by 2030, it is very plausible that the goal of a well-below 2°C temperature increase is also out of reach.\nA substantial part of the technical potential can be realized through scaling up and replicating existing, well-proven policies – such as switching to renewable energy and reforestation - that simultaneously contribute to key sustainable development goals.\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nThree IPCC Special Reports released in 2018 and 2019 assess complementary and specific aspects of climate change, ahead of the Sixth Assessment Report.\nThe Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C states that limiting warming to 1.5ºC is not physically impossible but would require unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society. There are clear benefits to keeping warming to 1.5 ºC compared to 2 ºC or higher. Every bit of warming matters.\nLimiting warming to 1.5ºC can go hand in hand with reaching other world goals such as achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty.\nThe Special Report on Climate Change and Land stressed that land is already under growing human pressure and climate change is adding to these pressures. At the same time, keeping global warming to well below 2ºC can be achieved only by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors including land and food.\n\"The report shows that better land management can contribute to tackling climate change, but land is not the only solution. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors including energy is essential if global warming is to be kept as close as possible to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels.\"\nOn 25 September 2019, the IPCC is due to release the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.\nClimate Insights\nFuture Earth and Earth League\nConsolidated evidence reinforces human influence as the dominant cause of changes to the Earth system, in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene.\nGrowing climate impacts increase the risks of crossing critical tipping points. These refer to thresholds that, if crossed, lead to far-reaching, in some cases abrupt and/or irreversible changes.\nThere is a growing recognition that climate impacts are hitting harder and sooner than climate assessments indicated even a decade ago.\nAs climate change intensifies, cities are particularly vulnerable to impacts such as heat stress and can play a key role in reducing emissions locally and globally.\nStrategies for mitigation and for upscaling adaptive risk management are necessary going forward. Neither is adequate in isolation given the pace of climate change and magnitude of its impacts.\nOnly immediate and all-inclusive action encompassing: deep de-carbonization complemented by ambitious policy measures, protection and enhancement of carbon sinks and biodiversity, and efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, will enable us to meet the Paris Agreement.\nGlobal Framework for Climate Services\nClimate and early warning information services should underpin decision-making on climate action for adaptation."

   "title": "Ice sheet melting: it’s not just about sea level rise",
   "paragraph": "Ice sheet melting: it’s not just about sea level rise\nPosted on 30 September 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from The Science Breaker by Kaitlin Naughten\nClimate change is causing the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets to melt, which releases cold, fresh meltwater into the nearby ocean. This meltwater causes sea level rise, but a lesser-known side effect is the disruption of deep ocean currents and climate patterns worldwide. Our modelling study investigated these processes.\nYou’ve probably heard that climate change is melting the polar ice caps – but what does this actually mean? It refers to the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, which are large systems of interconnected glaciers, kilometres thick. They are formed by snow falling on land, which compacts into ice and slowly flows downhill towards the ocean. When the ice sheets come into contact with a warming atmosphere or ocean, they begin to melt faster than new ice can form. This releases cold, fresh meltwater into the surrounding ocean. The most well-known consequence of this process is sea-level rise, as the volume of the ocean increases. Unfortunately, there are other side effects beyond sea level rise.\nThe oceans around Greenland and Antarctica are unusual because they are the only regions of the world’s oceans with significant vertical mixing. Everywhere else, the ocean is stratified, forming layers of water organised by density, with the lightest water at the surface and the heaviest water at the seafloor. The layers don’t interact with each other very much. But in a few locations around the coast of Antarctica, as well as in the North Atlantic Ocean near Greenland, surface water becomes cold and salty enough to sink into the deep ocean. Then it slowly travels around the world for about a thousand years, like a deep-ocean conveyor belt, before resurfacing. This process of “deep water formation”, occurring in just a few regions, affects deep ocean currents which transport heat around the world and influence climate patterns worldwide. But what happens when ice sheet meltwater is released into these deep water formation regions? How are the ocean currents and climate patterns affected?\nOur study addressed this question using two different models: an ice sheet model, which simulates the flow of the glaciers making up the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, and a climate model, which simulates the global atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and vegetation. Both models run on supercomputers and solve huge numbers of physics equations. Our study was novel because the ice sheet model and the climate model were able to communicate with each other, exchanging information regularly throughout the simulations.\nWe ran a number of different simulations over the 21st century, using several different scenarios for fossil fuel emissions, which might decline in the future but might continue to grow. In some experiments, the climate model considered the effect of ice sheet meltwater in its calculations; in other experiments, it ignored the meltwater. This allowed us to isolate the impact of ice sheet meltwater on the climate system.\nIn our simulations, ice sheet melting slowed down the rate of nearby deep water formation. The fresh meltwater reduced the density of the surface ocean, making it more difficult for surface waters to sink. In the North Atlantic, this reduction in deep water formation altered the pathways of nearby ocean currents. The Gulf Stream, which travels up the east coast of North America, and its extension the North Atlantic Drift, which cuts across the Atlantic towards Europe, were redirected such that less heat was transported from North America to Europe. While both locations still warmed (due to climate change), eastern North America experienced a bit of extra warming, while in Europe some of the warmings were canceled out. Furthermore, temperatures became more variable in many regions, indicating a greater prevalence of extreme weather.\nAround Antarctica, deep water formation connects the cold atmosphere to the warmer subsurface ocean. This allows the ocean to release heat, warming the atmosphere while cooling the deep ocean. In our simulations, a reduction in deep water formation suppressed this effect, trapping heat beneath the ocean surface. Ice sheet melting, therefore, caused the atmosphere around Antarctica to warm less than it otherwise would have, while the subsurface ocean warmed more dramatically. This result is particularly troubling because the Antarctic Ice Sheet is in contact with these regions of the ocean. It suggests a vicious cycle whereby ice sheet melting causes subsurface ocean warming, which causes more ice sheet melting, and so on.\nIt is now clear that the effects of ice sheet melting are not just limited to sea-level rise. We can expect ice sheet meltwater to have many more side effects, on ocean currents and weather patterns. But how much will the ice sheets actually melt? That depends on fossil fuel emissions, and how they change in the future. Our study used models, but the same experiment is currently being run in the real world, in real-time.\nOriginal Article:\nN.

   "title": "CSLDF: Events at NOAA Highlight Strengths and Shortcomings of Agency Scientific Integrity Policies",
   "paragraph": "CSLDF: Events at NOAA Highlight Strengths and Shortcomings of Agency Scientific Integrity Policies\nPosted on 26 September 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a repost from the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund blog, by CSLDF Executive Director Lauren Kurtz\nPresident Trump’s recent tweets about Hurricane Dorian have resulted in another type of storm that highlights the need for stronger protections for scientific integrity—especially at federal agencies.\nThe political storm began on September 1 when Trump incorrectly included Alabama in a tweet listing states that could potentially be hit by the hurricane. The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Birmingham, Alabama soon tweeted a correction, stating that Dorian was not a threat to Alabama. When Trump doubled down and claimed he was right to warn of potential hurricane damage to Alabama—and displayed the now-infamous altered weather map—NWS’s parent agency, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), initially attempted to avoid becoming involved. Then, on September 6, NOAA issued an unsigned statement supporting Trump’s erroneous claim.\nThe media has since reported that NOAA leadership instructed staff on both September 1 and 4 to “only stick with official National Hurricane Center forecasts” and not “provide any opinion” in response to the President’s tweets. There are also reports that Wilbur L. Ross Jr, the Secretary of Commerce, who oversees NOAA, threatened to fire NOAA employees over the attempts to correct Trump, resulting in the September 6 unsigned statement. The Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General is now investigating the situation.\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, Craig McLean, NOAA’s acting chief scientist, sent an email to NOAA staff calling the agency’s actions “political” and “not based on science.” He wrote, “I am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.” National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini also spoke in defense of NWS forecasters and their efforts to correct misinformation, commending them for upholding “the integrity of the forecasting process.”\nWe’re glad to see these leaders speaking out on behalf of scientific integrity. This troubling incident highlights the strengths and weaknesses of federal scientific integrity policies, which are designed to preserve scientific objectivity and protect science from being misrepresented. NOAA’s Scientific Integrity Policy (Administrative Order 202-735D) is generally seen as one of the better federal scientific integrity policies, and NOAA’s policy makes it clear that censorship and interference are considered violations of scientific integrity. Here’s why.\nThe policy promises that NOAA will “ensure the free flow of scientific information” and that “NOAA will preserve the integrity of the scientific activities it conducts, and activities that are conducted on its behalf” (5.02 and 5.02(a)). NOAA’s policy establishes that, “in no circumstance may any NOAA official ask or direct Federal scientists or other NOAA employees to suppress or alter scientific findings” (5.02(d)), and commits NOAA to “communicate scientific and technological findings… [including] accurate context of uncertainties” (5.02(g)). The policy also states that “NOAA scientists may freely speak to the media and the public about scientific and technical matters based on their official work” (4.05).\nIn light of these assurances, we believe NOAA violated its own scientific integrity policy, both with the September 1 and September 4 attempts to keep scientists from speaking freely to the press about whether Alabama was in danger, and the September 6 NOAA statement suggesting that Trump’s tweets were accurate representations of the forecasts.\nWhile the Trump incident is particularly disturbing, it reflects a larger trend towards government censorship, bias, and misrepresentation of science. We’re documenting these actions in a public database, the Silencing Science Tracker, our project with the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. The Tracker now contains 245 entries related to the federal government attempting to silence science—a tally that’s increasing at an alarming rate.\nThis series of events also emphasizes the need for stronger protections for scientific integrity. Despite its strengths, the NOAA scientific integrity policy has shortcomings. For example, the policy doesn’t give scientists the right to review news releases regarding their work—some other agency policies, like EPA’s, explicitly grant this. It’s also been reported that NOAA will dismiss a scientific integrity complaint if a complainant discloses the existence of the complaint. And NOAA’s scientific integrity policy, like other federal scientific integrity policies, does not grant a right of appeal, and does not always fully protect scientists from potential retaliation from filing a complaint.\nThis is why we’ve joined other public interest groups in support of the Scientific Integrity Act, which would greatly improve the legal landscape for federal scientists. In the meantime, we continue to publish educational resources and lead workshops for federal government employees, public university researchers, and scientists at private institutions to improve their legal literacy and help them understand how to respond when something seems amiss.\nWe also encourage researchers from any discipline to contact us to arrange a free, confidential consultation if they have legal questions or issues related to their work.\n— Lauren Kurtz is the executive director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund"

   "title": "A brief guide to the impacts of climate change on food production",
   "paragraph": "A brief guide to the impacts of climate change on food production\nPosted on 23 September 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections by Daisy Simmons with input from from Dana Nuccitelli on the latest IPCC report\nFood may be a universal language – but in these record-breaking hot days, so too is climate change. With July clocking in as the hottest month on Earth in recorded history and extreme weather ramping up globally, farmers are facing the brunt of climate change in croplands and pastures around the world.\nHere in the U.S., for instance, climate impacts like more downpours make it harder to avert flooding and erosion on farms across the Midwest. California farmers, on the other hand, must find ways to stay productive despite increasing drought and wildfire risks.\nIt all amounts to far more than anecdotal inconvenience: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth National Climate Assessment report projects that warming temperatures, severe heat, drought, wildfire, and major storms will “increasingly disrupt agricultural productivity,” threatening not only farmers’ livelihoods but also food security, quality, and price stability.\nIf these anticipated effects sound extreme, so too are the causes.\nFive climate impacts affecting food production now\nClimate change poses not just one but a whole slew of challenges to farmers – and to the larger communities that depend on them for food. From erratic precipitation to changing seasons, consider just these five key climatic changes and how they stand to affect food availability now and in the future:\n1) More extreme weather can harm livestock and crops. Major storms have always devastated farms, whether from damaging winds during a storm, or erosion and landslides that can rear up even as the storm subsides. But now they’re becoming even more common. In spring 2018, for example, unusually heavy rain and snow storms caused massive flooding across the U.S. Midwest, leaving some areas 10 feet deep in sand. In Nebraska alone, farmers lost an estimated $440 million of cattle. As a result of these flooding conditions, many farmers had to delay spring planting. Delays in commodity crops like corn and soybeans aren’t just stressful for farmers, either – they could lead to food price volatility and even potential food insecurity.\n2) Water scarcity across the U.S. Southwest makes it more expensive and difficult to sustain crops and livestock. Drought is in the long-term outlook across the U.S. West, with declining snowpack making it more challenging to keep reservoirs full through summer. Lack of adequate water can easily damage or destroy crops, dry up soil, and threaten livelihoods. Between 2014-2016, for example, California endured an estimated $3.8 billion of direct statewide economic losses to agriculture as a result of drought.\n3) Seasons aren’t what they used to be. Growing seasons are starting earlier and getting hotter in a warming climate. A longer growing season, over time, could theoretically have some advantages, but it also presents more obstacles in the short term, such as an uptick in pest populations is possible, with more generations possible per year. Early spring onset can also cause crops to grow before the soil holds enough water and nutrients, or to ruin fruit crops that bud early and then experience later spring frost. Plus, warmer winters can affect other farming practices like grain storage.\nParched and fire-damaged ag fields pose mounting challenges to farmers and consumers.\n4) Wildfire can devastate farms – even when the flames don’t actually reach them. Ranchers across the West have recently seen major losses as a result of worsening fire seasons, from outright loss of life to charred grazing lands and decimated hay stocks. What’s more, “secondary impacts” abound, from a smoky taint that can ruin wine, to the ordeal of keeping a farm operational when fires are raging nearby and evacuation orders seem just around the corner. All this also causes costs to mount given that the respiratory dangers of laboring in smoky, excessively hot conditions can force farms to send workers home in the height of harvest season.\n5) Warmer weather and rising CO2 levels adversely affect food supply, safety and quality. According to a 2019 IPCC land use report, between 25 and 30 percent of the food produced worldwide is wasted, not all of it for the same reasons. In developed countries, for instance, consumers, sometimes seemingly with abandon, simply discard what they see as “excess” or “surplus” food. In developing countries, much of the waste is brought about by a lack of refrigeration as products go bad between producers and consumers. The IPCC report estimates that food waste costs about $1 trillion per year and accounts for about 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from food systems. Meanwhile, some two-billion humans worldwide are overweight or obese even as nearly one billion are undernourished, highlighting the inefficiencies and inequities in food distribution.\nIn addition, rising temperatures can alter exposures to some pathogens and toxins. Consider: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Vibrio parahaemolyticus in raw oysters, and mycotoxigenic fungi, which can all potentially thrive in warmer environments. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also can decrease dietary iron, zinc, protein, and other macro- and micronutrients in certain crops.\nNow for the elephant still in the room: Food production isn’t just being affected by climate change – it’s actively contributing to climate change, too. According to IPCC’s land use report, agriculture and other land uses comprise more than one-fifth of global CO2 emissions, creating a vicious cycle.\nGrowing solutions to the climate crisis\nThe July IPCC report cited above lists various adaptation and mitigation measures that could help reduce the adverse impacts of food and dietary preferences on climate change. The suggestions address more sustainable food production and diets (more plant-based, less meat-based); improved forestry management (including reducing deforestation and increasing reforestation); agricultural carbon sequestration, including no-till farming practices; and reducing food waste.\nAnd it warns that delaying action will be costly:\nDeferral of [greenhouse gas] emissions reductions from all sectors implies trade-offs including irreversible loss in land ecosystem functions and services required for food, health, habitable settlements and production, leading to increasingly significant economic impacts on many countries in many regions of the world.\nSo, what can individuals do to help avert some of the worsening impacts of climate on food supply? There in fact are a number of ways to help support climate-friendlier food production.\nImproving soil health, on a large-scale, is one key way forward. Nutrient-rich soil stores carbon better than degraded, overworked soil. Plus, healthy soil helps farms stay productive – a win-win. Consumers can boost these efforts, by supporting farmers and ranchers who engage in sustainable practices like cover cropping and composting.\nReducing meat consumption is another way to reduce the climate impact of food production, given that a livestock farm is like a methane factory, contributing an estimated 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meatless Mondays, “flexitarian” diets, and the rise of faux-meat brands are all testimony to the growing efforts aimed at reducing meat consumption.\nIn addition to consumer actions, there are interesting new ways forward on the industry side. Manure digesters, for one, can convert methane from manure into electricity. And seaweed is gaining scientific interest for its potential in making cattle burp less often. (Yes, you read that right.)\nPolicy efforts will likely be key also. California for its part has goals to direct some cap-and-trade funding to build compost facilities, and incentivize methane reduction in dairies.\nThe challenges ahead are steep. But so too are the opportunities to adapt to new realities and reduce assorted diverse impacts. According to Project Drawdown, three of the top 10 best climate solutions have something to do with food, from reducing food waste (3) and choosing a plant-rich diet (4) to silvopasturing (9), which integrates trees and pasture into a single ecosystem.\nIt isn’t always easy to make such changes. What is getting easier, though, is to see that the world’s collective appetite for fossil fuels is having a negative impact on real food and on dietary options.\nAnd the option of inaction on something so fundamental? Through their food-purchasing and dietary preferences, Americans increasingly, albeit perhaps only gradually, are showing that they are increasingly wary about swallowing that one."

   "paragraph": "2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming Digest #38\nPosted on 22 September 2019 by John Hartz\nStory of the Week... Toon of the Week... Coming Soon on SkS... Climate Feedback Reviews... SkS Week in Review... Poster of the Week...\nStory of the Week...\nGlobal Climate in 2015-2019: Climate change accelerates\nRecord greenhouse gas concentrations mean further warming\nThe tell-tale signs and impacts of climate change – such as sea level rise, ice loss and extreme weather – increased during 2015-2019, which is set to be the warmest five-year period on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere have also increased to record levels, locking in the warming trend for generations to come.\nThe WMO report on The Global Climate in 2015-2019, released to inform the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, says that the global average temperature has increased by 1.1°C since the pre-industrial period, and by 0.2°C compared to 2011-2015.\nThe climate statement – which covers until July 2019 - was released as part of a high-level synthesis report from leading scientific institutions United in Science under the umbrella of the Science Advisory Group of the UN Climate Summit 2019. The report provides a unified assessment of the state of Earth system under the increasing influence of climate change, the response of humanity this far and projected changes of global climate in the future. It highlights the urgency and the potential of ambitious climate action in order to limit potentially irreversible impacts.\nAn accompanying WMO report on greenhouse gas concentrations shows that 2015-2019 has seen a continued increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and other key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to new records, with CO2 growth rates nearly 20% higher than the previous five years. CO2 remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the ocean for even longer. Preliminary data from a subset of greenhouse gas observational sites for 2019 indicate that CO2 global concentrations are on track to reach or even exceed 410 ppm by the end of 2019.\n“Climate change causes and impacts are increasing rather than slowing down,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, who is co-chair of the Science Advisory Group of the UN Climate Summit.\n“Sea level rise has accelerated and we are concerned that an abrupt decline in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which will exacerbate future rise. As we have seen this year with tragic effect in the Bahamas and Mozambique, sea level rise and intense tropical storms led to humanitarian and economic catastrophes,” he said.\n“The challenges are immense. Besides mitigation of climate change, there is a growing need to adapt. According to the recent Global Adaptation Commission report the most powerful way to adapt is to invest in early warning services, and pay special attention to impact-based forecasts,” he said.\n“It is highly important that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, notably from energy production, industry and transport. This is critical if we are to mitigate climate change and meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement,” he said.\n“To stop a global temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the level of ambition needs to be tripled. And to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees, it needs to be multiplied by five,” he said.\nSea level rise:\nOver the five-year period May 2014 -2019, the rate of global mean sea-level rise has amounted to 5 mm per year, compared with 4 mm per year in the 2007-2016 ten-year period. This is substantially faster than the average rate since 1993 of 3.2 mm/year. The contribution of land ice melt from the world glaciers and the ice sheets has increased over time and now dominate the sea level budget, rather than thermal expansion.\nShrinking Ice:\nThroughout 2015-2018, the Arctic’s average September minimum (summer) sea-ice extent was well below the 1981-2010 average, as was the average winter sea-ice extent. The four lowest records for winter occurred during this period. Multi-year ice has almost disappeared.\nAntarctic February minimum (summer) and September maximum (winter) sea-ice extent values have become well below the 1981-2010 average since 2016. This is in contrast to the previous 2011-2015 period and the long term 1979-2018 period. Antarctic summer sea ice reached its lowest and second lowest extent on record in 2017 and 2018, respectively, with 2017 also being the second lowest winter extent.\nThe amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold, from 40 Gt per year in 1979-1990 to 252 Gt per year in 2009-2017.\nThe Greenland ice sheet has witnessed a considerable acceleration in ice loss since the turn of the millennium.\nFor 2015-2018, the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) reference glaciers indicates an average specific mass change of −908 mm water equivalent per year, higher than in all other five-year periods since 1950.\nOcean heat and acidity:\nMore than 90 % of the excess heat caused by climate change is stored in the oceans. 2018 had the largest ocean heat content values on record measured over the upper 700 meters, with 2017 ranking second and 2015 third.\nThe ocean absorbs around 30% of the annual anthropogenic emissions of CO2, thereby helping to alleviate additional warming. The ecological costs to the ocean, however, are high, as the absorbed CO2 reacts with seawater and changes the acidity of the ocean. There has been an overall increase in acidity of 26% since the beginning of the industrial revolution.\nExtreme events:\nMore than 90 % of the natural disasters are related to weather. The dominant disasters are storms and flooding, which have also led to highest economic losses. Heatwaves and drought have led to human losses, intensification of forest fires and loss of harvest.\nHeatwaves, which were the deadliest meteorological hazard in the 2015-2019 period, affecting all continents and resulting in numerous new temperature records. Almost every study of a significant heatwave since 2015 has found the hallmark of climate change, according to the report.\nThe largest economic losses were associated with tropical cyclones. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most devastating on record with more than US$ 125 billion in losses associated with Hurricane Harvey alone. On the Indian Ocean, in March and April 2019, unprecedented and devastating back-to-back tropical cyclones hit Mozambique.\nWildfires\nWildfires are strongly influenced by weather and climate phenomena. Drought substantially increases the risk of wildfire in most forest regions, with a particularly strong influence on long-lived fires. The three largest economic losses on record from wildfires have all occurred in the last four years.\nIn many cases, fires have led to massive releases of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Summer 2019 saw unprecedented wildfires in the Arctic region. In June alone, these fires emitted 50 megatons (Mt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is more than was released by Arctic fires in the same month from 2010 to 2018 put together. There were also massive forest fires in Canada and Sweden in 2018. There were also widespread fires in the non-renewable tropical rain forests in Southern Asia and Amazon, which have had impacts on the global carbon budget.\nClimate change and extreme events\nAccording to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, over the period 2015 to 2017, 62 of the 77 events reported show a significant anthropogenic influence on the event’s occurrence, including almost every study of a significant heatwave. An increasing number of studies are also finding a human influence on the risk of extreme rainfall events.\nGlobal Climate in 2015-2019: Climate change accelerates, WMO Press Release, Sep 22, 2019\nToon of the Week...\nComing Soon on SkS...\nA brief guide to the impacts of climate change on food production (Daisy Simmons)\nSkeptical Science New Research for Week #38, 2019 (Doug Bostrom)\nHow the Greenland ice sheet fared in 2019 (Ruth Mottram, Martin Stendel & Peter Langen)\nA small electric plane demonstrates promise, obstacles of climate-friendly air travel (Lindsay Fendt)\nWhat psychotherapy can do for the climate and biodiversity crises (Caroline Hickman)\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #39 (John Hartz)\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming Digest #39 (John Hartz\nClimate Feedback Reviews...\n[To be added]\nPoster of the Week...\nSkS Week in Review...\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #38 by John Hartz\nThe Consensus Handbook: download and translations by Baerbel\nGreta Thunberg is a painful reminder of decades of climate failures by Dana Nuccitelli (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists)\nSkeptical Science to join the Global Climate Strike on September 20! by BaerbelW\nSkeptical Science New Research for Week #37, 2019 by Doug Bostrom\n'Trollbots' Swarm Twitter with Attacks on Climate Science Ahead of UN Summit by Marianne Lavell (InsideClimate News)\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming Digest #37 by John Hartz"

It provides answers to questions like these:\nWhy has manufacturing doubt about the scientific consensus been such a priority for opponents of climate action?\nWhat kind of strategies have they employed?\nMost importantly, how should science-based climate communicators respond?\nTo answer these questions, Center for Climate Change Communication (4C) researchers John Cook and Ed Maibach in collaboration with Sander van der Linden from Cambridge and Stephan Lewandowsky from Bristol University developed The Consensus Handbook. This concise, practical booklet examines how opponents of climate action have been attempting to misinform the public and policy makers about the consensus for decades, and it explains why. Drawing on numerous scientific studies, the handbook also recommends how to respond to this misinformation campaign by effectively communicating the extent of the scientific consensus, and it provides guidance to climate scientists who are invited to \"debate\" about climate change.\nTranslations\nThe Consensus Handbook has been translated into the following language:\nGerman\nDownload\nNote to other translators:\nIf you'd like to translate The Consensus Handbook into another language, please contact us by selecting \"Enquiry about translations\" from the contact form's dropdown menu.

   "paragraph": "Greta Thunberg is a painful reminder of decades of climate failures\nPosted on 19 September 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\nThis story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 300 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.\nSixteen-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has ignited the climate movement, most recently taking a zero-carbon ocean voyage to America to attend the September 23rd UN climate summit in New York City. She’s become so effective and inspiring that those who want to maintain the status quo—predominantly wealthy and powerful old white men—have begun to attack her. Greta has been called “the international mascot for climate alarmism … mentally unstable,” “a millenarian cult leader,” a “deeply disturbed messiah of the global warming movement,” a “teenage puppet,” a “petulant child,” and much more.\nGreta articulated her views in a TEDx talk in which she accurately described the state of climate science and the fact that if we are to meet the Paris climate targets, developed countries in particular must rapidly reduce their carbon pollution. As Greta notes, the world has thus far failed to act, in part because most people don’t realize that rapid change is required.\nBut climate scientists have been warning about a potential climate crisis for decades, while the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers failed to act on those warnings. As a result, they frittered away the opportunity to transition away from fossil fuels with relative ease. Because of those decades of inaction, we now face a daunting task.\nWhile some older Americans may “have no patience for teenagers who lecture adults,” Greta’s generation has every right to criticize them for endangering humanity’s future prosperity. Let’s examine the history of climate change warnings and missed opportunities.\n1960s–1970s. Every American president since the 1960s has been warned about climate change. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson’s science advisory committee sent him an environmental report with a section on atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate change. These top scientists wrote: “Through his worldwide industrial civilization, Man is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical experiment. Within a few generations he is burning the fossil fuels that slowly accumulated in the earth over the past 500 million years … The climatic changes that may be produced by the increased CO2content could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings.”\nIn 1979, the world’s foremost climate scientists published a major climate report finding that if humans double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Earth’s average surface temperatures will warm 3 degrees Celsius (plus or minus 1.5 degrees Celsius)—consistent with estimates from today’s climate scientists, and an extremely dangerous level of climate change. The report included a similar warning to that in 1965, “Man is unwittingly conducting a vast experiment … marked changes in climate, not controllable through local or even national efforts, could occur.”\nThat year, President Carter installed 32 solar panels on the White House and called for a campaign to conservative energy during the Middle East oil embargo, but President Reagan did not share Carter’s environmental awareness and removed the solar panels in 1986.\n1980s. In the early 1980s, Exxon’s climate scientists issued internal company reports warning that fossil fuel consumption could double atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by 2060, pushing global temperatures up by more than 2 degrees Celsius. In 1988, an internal Shell company report included a similar warning, but noted that we could reach doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels as soon as 2030 in a scenario with high fossil fuel consumption. Shell’s scientists warned the company: “The [climate] changes may be the greatest in recorded history … the energy industry will clearly need to work out the part it should play in the development of policies and programmes to tackle the whole [climate] problem.” As we now know, the industry decided to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in a public disinformation campaign to undermine support for climate policies.\nSeveral top climate scientists delivered a clear, public warning about a potential climate crisis in congressional testimony in June 1988. NASA climate scientist James Hansen testified that human-caused global warming was already detectable. NOAA scientist Syukuro Manabe discussed some climate impacts like earlier snowmelt and worsening droughts, while George Woodwell of the Woods Hole Research Center said that planning must begin for a sharp reduction in the burning of fossil fuels and for reforestation efforts.\nThe congressional hearing and scientific testimony had an immediate impact on policymakers. In a speech delivered on the campaign trail a few months later in August 1988, soon-to-be president George H.W. Bush declared, “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect.” President Bush soon had an opportunity to deliver on that promise during the first major diplomatic meeting on global warming, held in Noordwijk, Netherlands in November 1989.\nBut, as Nathaniel Rich documented for the New York Times, Bush had appointed climate denier John Sununu as his chief of staff. Upon hearing a description of Hansen’s congressional testimony, Sununu declared it “technical garbage.” While EPA Administrator William K. Reilly fought for the United States to take a leadership role by demanding a global treaty to reduce carbon emissions, Sununu overruled him. The White House censored testimony delivered by Hansen and other government scientists in a second congressional climate hearing in 1989. And at the November international climate negotiations in Noordwijk, Sununu’s representatives forced the conference to abandon a commitment to freeze greenhouse gas emissions.\n1990s. By the time of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, Bush was sounding like Donald Trump when speaking about climate change, declaring, “I’m not going to go to the Rio conference and make a bad deal or be a party to a bad deal.”\nBill Clinton defeated Bush in the presidential election that November, and in 1993 proposed an energy tax to begin addressing climate change. But, spooked by the close call at the Noordwijk international climate negotiations, Exxon and other fossil fuel companies had begun spending millions of dollars campaigning against climate action, eroding support in Congress and dooming the bill.\nIn 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded, “potentially serious [climate] changes have been identified, including an increase in some regions in the incidence of extreme high-temperature events, floods, and droughts … Delaying [mitigation and adaptation] measures may leave a nation or the world poorly prepared to deal with adverse changes and may increase the possibility of irreversible or very costly consequences.”\nWhile President Clinton ultimately signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, the Senate had already voted 95-0 to pre-emptively declare its opposition to the treaty, and refused to ratify it.\n2000s. In 2001, the IPCC warned, “some extreme events are projected to increase in frequency and/or severity during the 21st century due to changes in the mean and/or variability of climate, so it can be expected that the severity of their impacts will also increase in concert with global warming … The impacts of future changes in climate extremes are expected to fall disproportionately on the poor.”\nPresident George W. Bush took office that year, and his 8-year presidency was marred by censorship of federal climate science reports, obstruction of international climate negotiations, and a refusal to implement any federal climate policies.\nThe 2007 IPCC report detailed many climate change risks, including of large-scale species extinctions: “Approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5-2.5degrees Celsius.”\nIn 2009, the United States began to turn the corner on climate policy. With President Obama in the White House and with control of Congress, Democrats nearly passed a carbon cap and trade bill. The legislation passed the House, but the threat of a filibuster from all Senate Republicans and a few Democrats from fossil fuel states killed the effort.\n2010s. Lacking sufficient congressional support, President Obama was forced to resort to executive action, most notably in his second term with the EPA’s Clean Power Plan and his signing of the Paris climate agreement.\nThe IPCC’s climate warnings grew louder in its 2014 report, which concluded, “Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability … Climate-related hazards affect poor people’s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields, or destruction of homes and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity.”\nUnfortunately, after his election in 2016, President Trump reversed all of the climate policies enacted by the Obama administration, including announcing America’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement and gutting the Clean Power Plan. While US carbon pollution fell over the past decade thanks to a combination of the 2008 economic recession and a transition away from dirty coal power, emissions spiked in 2018. Globally, most countries’ climate policies remain insufficient to meet the Paris targets, with the United States among the worst offenders. As the independent organization Climate Action Tracker has noted, “Reaching the [nationally determined contribution] target would have required implementing additional policies under the Obama Administration’s Climate Action Plan, which President Trump has rescinded.”\nIn 2018, the IPCC published a special report that concluded, “The combination of rising exposure to climate change and the fact that there is a limited capacity to adapt to its impacts amplifies the risks posed by warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius … the lower the rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels, the lower the risks to human societies and natural ecosystems.” According to NASA data, we surpassed the 1 degree Celsius milestone around 2016.\nWe wasted decades; now time is running out. Crucially, the longer we wait to substantially curb carbon pollution, the more difficult and expensive it will be to avoid a climate crisis. This is elegantly illustrated in a chart sometimes referred to as the “ski slopes.” Had global emissions peaked in the 1990s, we could have met the Paris targets by slowly and gradually reducing carbon pollution in the ensuing decades—a “bunny slope” path. Had they peaked in the early 2000s, we could have met the Paris goals with more moderate emissions cuts—the “intermediate slope.” But emissions have not yet peaked as we approach the year 2020, and we’re nearing the “double black diamond” slope requiring extremely rapid pollution cuts if we’re to avoid dangerous warming beyond the Paris targets.\nIn short, despite decades’ worth of warnings from climate scientists, the elder generations squandered away the opportunity for a relatively easy transition away from fossil fuels toward a stable climate future. Much of the blame lies with the fossil fuel industry and its costly climate disinformation campaign, but there is plenty of blame to go around.\nWhile misogyny is undoubtedly at play in the attacks on Greta Thunberg, simple guilt is another likely root cause. Greta is the voice of a generation who will bear the consequences of their elders’ decades’ worth of missed opportunities and failures to heed climate scientists’ warnings and begin the transition away from fossil fuels while it could still be done gradually and with relative ease. Now, because of those failures, dramatic policies to rapidly overhaul our infrastructure are needed, in the mold of a Green New Deal. Some Republican policymakers are finally calling for small steps to address the problem like encouraging “innovation,” but while such modest measures would have been welcome 20 or 30 years ago, they are wholly insufficient to meet the scope of the problem we face today.\nUntil our leaders implement major policy changes to mitigate the climate crisis, Greta’s generation will be wholly justified in lecturing them for selfishly frittering away the stability of our global climate. And based on the abhorrent attacks on Greta that clumsily mask a deep sense of guilt, her critics know it."

   "title": "'Trollbots' Swarm Twitter with Attacks on Climate Science Ahead of UN Summit",
   "paragraph": "'Trollbots' Swarm Twitter with Attacks on Climate Science Ahead of UN Summit\nPosted on 16 September 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Inside Climate News by Marianne Lavelle\nCNN's seven-hour climate change town hall for presidential candidates was not a TV ratings bonanza, but it set off a marked surge of activity on Twitter aimed at ridiculing the Democrats and dismissing the science.\n\"Climate change\" became the top two-word trending topic on Twitter for several hours after the event among the accounts being tracked by Bot Sentinel, a free platform designed to track what it considers untrustworthy or automated accounts. It was quite an unusual feat for the topic to beat out—even temporarily—the phrase that sits almost constantly atop the trending list for accounts on Bot Sentinel's watchlist: \"President Trump.\"\nScientists, activists and politicians who are engaged in climate policy say they are being besieged by a surge of online attacks. It is difficult to divine whether the bursts of \"climate change\"-related Twitter activity are spontaneous or part of coordinated campaigns; some experts say that likely a small number of influencers are touching off postings by a far larger number of followers. But in a post-2016 world that is keenly aware of the role that social media played in the election of Donald Trump, the targets of climate attacks are concerned about the potential for online onslaughts to manipulate opinion and neutralize growing public support for climate action.\n\"I believe this is a concerted effort, likely by bad state actors and fossil fuel interests, to create disinformation, discord and division as we approach the all-important UN Summit and children's youth event later this month,\" said climate scientist Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, a frequent target of attacks.\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the activity.\nTracking 'Trollbot' Attacks\nBot Sentinel has become a tool for those trying to fight the spread of disinformation on Twitter. The platform uses an algorithm to identify accounts it labels as \"trollbots\"—those that frequently retweet known propaganda accounts, exhibit repetitive behavior or violate Twitter's terms of service by harassing other users. Following CNN's climate forum on Sept. 4, there was an unusually high 700 mentions of climate change in a 24-hour period from the 100,000-some accounts Bot Sentinel is tracking as trollbots.\nWhen a topic like \"climate change\" trends among the trollbots, it is likely there is some amount of coordination involved, said software developer Christopher Bouzy, founder of the year-old Bot Sentinel platform.\n\"What we are noticing is these phrases are more than likely being pushed by accounts that have an agenda,\" Bouzy said.\n\"It's fascinating to see this stuff happen in real time,\" he said. \"Sometimes we can see literally five or 10 accounts able to manipulate a hashtag because they have so many people following them. It doesn't take that many accounts to get something going.\"\nFollowing the CNN climate forum, for example, many accounts began sharing video clip montages of the event edited together by Trump's re-election campaign and by the far-right web outlet the Gateway Pundit to portray the candidates in the worst possible light.\n\"Democrat #Socialists want to ban: - everything made from plastic - red meat - nuclear power...I don't think even Venezuelans have ever been this brainwashed!\" commented @Condor_Law, an account rated \"alarming\" by Bot Sentinel—84 percent of its posts exhibit patterns that match the activity of trollbots (spreading information from sites known to be unreliable or violating Twitters terms of service and doing so repetitively.) \"The Dems position is ban straws, portion our meat, take our guns, take our cars, abort on a massive scale for population control, and all so we can die from climate change in 11 years!!\" another accounted rated \"alarming,\" @JenniferKrist28, chimed in.\nMann, the climate scientist, found himself on the receiving end of some of this activity after he posted a Tweet thanking CNN for a \"full evening of informed, detailed climate change conversation.\" \"Climate change is a hoax,\" replied @fdnymt, another account identified as exhibiting trollbot behavior by Bot Sentinel.\nSwedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, who traveled to the United States for the UN Summit, has been a frequent target of toxic online attacks. Soon after Thunberg started her two-week sailboat voyage across the Atlantic, British political donor and co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign Arron Banks tweeted, \"freak yachting accidents do happen in August.\" Following the lead of figures like Banks, lesser-known Twitter handles have piled on.\nThunberg has brushed off the attacks: \"When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go,\" she tweeted. \"I have Aspergers and that means I'm sometimes a bit different from the norm. And - given the right circumstances- being different is a superpower.\" U.S. climate change denier Steve Milloy, who served on Trump's transition team, responded to the teenager on Twitter, \"I don't know about you... but I am not going communist because Greta the Climate Puppet believes she has 'superpowers.'\"\nIn Canada, Politicians and an Election Targeted\nGovernment policies on climate change also appear to be triggering toxic online activity. Early this week, Canada Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, who is implementing that nation's carbon tax policy, said that she has been assigned an additional security detail because of abuse she has received both online and in person.\nAnd last week, a Canadian government agency issued a report concluding there was evidence of a campaign of coordinated, false social media postings around last April's election for premier of Alberta—a campaign in which climate policy was a key issue. The majority of the questionable postings were in support of the eventual winner, conservative Jason Kenney, who won the election while pledging to repeal the province's carbon tax, which he did in May, and to create a \"war room\" to combat the oil industry's opponents.\nThe government agency, Rapid Response Mechanism Canada, was created as part of the G7 nation's effort to respond to foreign influence in democratic elections. RRM Canada said there was no evidence of foreign actors involved in the questionable social media activity around the Alberta election. But, the agency said, \"some national actors were disseminating material using tactics that were similar to those used by foreign actors.\"\nGerald Kutney, an Ottawa-based consultant and author of a 2014 book on climate politics, said it has become difficult to discern what is genuine discussion and what is coordinated attack messaging on Twitter around climate change.\n\"It's no longer social media, it's bot media,\" he said. \"It's difficult to know the difference.\"\nTwitter Deactivated a Way to Block 'Trollbots'\nKutney endured so many online attacks after he got into a debate on climate change last fall with the Dilbert cartoon creator and prominent Trump supporter Scott Adams that he found a way to call for online help. He launched a hashtag, #climatebrawl, to signal when someone is under attack by climate deniers on Twitter. That hashtag, too, has often been swarmed by climate deniers; he doesn't know if these are human-controlled or automated accounts.\nBouzy said he got the idea for Bot Sentinel after seeing the impact of social media on the 2016 election in the United States. It is designed to identify coordinated online messaging campaigns regardless of politics; Bouzy said the algorithm is indifferent to whether accounts lean left or right.\nAt one point, Bouzy said Bot Sentinel had a feature that allowed users to block trollbots from their Twitter feeds, but he said Twitter deactivated the import tool without warning, rendering the feature unusable.\nBot Sentinel still gives Twitter users a way to analyze the behavior of individual accounts and see which topics are sparking trollbot activity.\n\"There are coordinated campaigns being run every single day. It's pretty much open season on these platforms,\" Bouzy said. \"We're just trying to give people a heads-up that this is happening—this is a narrative that's being pushed right now. You may want to be careful.\""

(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\nIn the debate about global warming, as last week’s climate change town hall on CNN made clear, policy discussions are often based on false premises. In Thursday’s debate, the Democratic presidential candidates will again discuss climate issues. Here are a few faulty assumptions they should reject.\nOne oft-repeated canard is that we won’t be able to reach zero net carbon dioxide emissions without re-embracing nuclear power. Several candidates responded to this claim last week by saying they could not support nuclear power because it was too expensive and we haven’t solved the waste disposal problem. Both those things are true, but they leave a crucial point out of the discussion.\nIf it were really the case that we couldn’t meet our energy needs without nuclear power, then we could certainly suck up the cost (currently about double that of solar, and as much as three times that of wind) and get back to work on waste disposal. But the assertion that we can’t decarbonize the energy system without additional nuclear power is flawed.\nCan we please base our climate change discussions on facts?, Opinion by Naomi Oreskes, Los Angeles Times, Sep 12, 2019\nClick here to access the entire Op-ed as published on the Los Angeles Times website.\nToon of the Week...\nComing Soon on SkS...\nSkeptical Science New Research for Week #37, 2019 (Doug Bostrom)\nClimate change and food (Yale Climate Connections)\nSkeptical Science to join the Global Climate Strike (Baerbel)\nThe Consensus Handbook: Download and (German) translation (Baerbel)\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #38 (John Hartz)\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming Digest #38 (John Hartz)\nClimate Feedback Reviews...\n[To be added.]\nPoster of the Week...\nSkS Week in Review...\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #37 by John Hartz\nClimate denier scientists think these 5 arguments will persuade EU and UN leaders by Dana Nuccitelli\nSkeptical Science New Research for Week #36, 2019 by Doug Bostrom\nKey facts about the new EPA plan to reverse the Obama-era methane leaks rule by Dana Nuccitelli (Yale Climate Connection)\n2019 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming Digest #36 by John Hartz"

But she wasn't looking to go inside — \"I don't want to meet with people who don't accept the science,\" she says.\nThe young Swedish activist joined a large crowd of protesters who had gathered outside, calling for immediate action to help the environment and reverse an alarming warming trend in average global temperatures.\nShe says her message for President Trump is the same thing she tells other politicians: Listen to science, and take responsibility.\nThunberg, 16, arrived in the U.S. last week after sailing across the Atlantic to avoid the carbon emissions from jet travel. She plans to spend nearly a week in Washington, D.C. — but she doesn't plan to meet with anyone from the Trump administration during that time.\n\"I haven't been invited to do that yet. And honestly I don't want to do that,\" Thunberg tells NPR's Ailsa Chang.

   "title": "Climate denier scientists think these 5 arguments will persuade EU and UN leaders",
   "paragraph": "Climate denier scientists think these 5 arguments will persuade EU and UN leaders\nPosted on 11 September 2019 by dana1981\nAs reported by DeSmogUK, in an effort to derail European Union climate policies and international climate negotiations, hundreds of climate denier scientists have drafted a letter to be sent to leaders of EU and UN institutions. The letter outlines their case for why climate change isn’t an emergency, but it simply reheats several old and stale climate myths.\nAlthough the letter is unlikely to achieve its goal of derailing climate negotiations and policies, since it represents the best case that climate deniers can make against the existence of a climate crisis, it’s worth examining the arguments therein.\nYes, humans are causing global warming\nThe first argument in the letter asserts that current global warming “is to be expected from the cyclic behavior of the climate system.”\nNo evidence is provided to support this claim or any other in the letter. In fact, the letter doesn’t even specify which cycle is purportedly responsible for the current global warming. That’s undoubtedly because there isn’t one. Earth’s temperatures are currently warming 20 to 50 times faster than when the planet exits an ice age, for example. No natural cycle can account for the current rapid global warming.\nThis is not a scientific argument; it’s just hand-waiving and magical thinking that climate scientists ruled out long ago.\nCarbon pollution is harmful\nThe second point in the letter combines two myths:\n“There is no proof that anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the major cause of global warming. There is also no scientific evidence that anthropogenic CO2 emissions have a detrimental effect on the quality of life.”\nThe use of the word “proof” here is a red flag. Science doesn’t operate by proofs; it operates by evidence, and there is overwhelming evidence that carbon pollution is the major cause of global warming. In fact, NASA climate scientists published a study in the prestigious journal Science in 2010 entitled “Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature.” The latest IPCC report concluded with 95% confidence that humans are responsible for most global warming since 1950, and most likely responsible for all of it.\nThere is also overwhelming scientific evidence that carbon pollution has a detrimental effect on the quality of life through its amplification of extreme weather events like droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and hurricanes.\nClimate models have been remarkably accurate\nThe third point in the letter argues,\n“climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools … they substantially overestimate the recent temperature increase.”\nAs I demonstrated in my book and in the video below, temperature predictions made by mainstream climate models have been remarkably accurate (unlike those made by deniers). Climate models are certainly among the scientific tools useful for policymaking, although we have enough evidence about the climate change risks we’re already experiencing even setting climate models aside.\nGlobal warming is amplifying extreme weather\nThe fourth point in the letter begins by denying that carbon pollution is intensifying extreme weather events, and ends with bizarre claims that efforts to curb carbon pollution are detrimental:\n“There is also no scientific evidence that higher CO2 levels are intensifying natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and droughts, or making them more frequent. On the other hand, there are many indications that most CO2-mitigation measures in use today have a devastating effect on wildlife (e.g. by wind turbines) and land use (e.g. forest clearance).”\nThe first claim here is indisputably false. A recent IPCC special report concluded with high confidence that “The frequency and intensity of some extreme weather and climate events have increased as a consequence of global warming and will continue to increase under medium and high emission scenarios,” including droughts and floods. Research has also shown that hotter ocean waters are intensifying the strongest hurricanes.\nThe second claim is even more absurd. Most low-carbon technologies obviously don’t devastate wildlife. As for wind, a 2009 study found that fossil fuel power kills about 15 times more birds per unit of energy produced than wind turbines. A comprehensive 2014 study concluded that cats kill about 7,000 times more birds per year in the U.S. than wind turbines. And forest clearance obviously isn’t a carbon mitigation measure; reforestation is, however.\nWe can’t just adapt to climate change\nThe final point in the letter argues that rather than curbing carbon pollution, we should just adapt to the consequences of climate change:\n“There is no climate emergency and therefore no cause for panic and alarm. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt.”\nThis is akin to arguing that people should continue smoking cigarettes and simply adapt to the health consequences like emphysema, bronchitis, and lung cancer because better treatments for those diseases may eventually emerge. As any doctor will explain, mitigation (quitting smoking, or in our case, phasing out carbon pollution) must be the first step to minimize the risk of a catastrophic outcome.\nThe recent IPCC report showed that limiting global warming to the more ambitious 1.5°C Paris target will require nearly halving global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The report also provided evidence that missing this target would create serious risks of worse food and water insecurity and yet more extreme weather.\nBecause of the global warming we’ve already locked in, we will have to both mitigate the problem and adapt to some of its consequences. As glaciologist Lonnie Thompson famously said of climate change, “The only question is how much we will mitigate, adapt, and suffer.” The more successful we are in mitigating carbon pollution, the less we’ll be forced to adapt and suffer.\nResearch has also shown that unmitigated climate change is far costlier than mitigation, potentially by tens of trillions of dollars. And it’s important to look beyond dollar signs and consider the suffering variable in Lonnie Thompson’s equation. Losing one’s home and belongings or loved ones to climate-intensified extreme weather events may have an insignificant impact on the economy, but the associated trauma and suffering come at high psychological costs that are well worth trying to avoid.\nIn short, this letter represents climate deniers' best case for inaction, and every single claim made therein is bogus."

   "paragraph": "Key facts about the new EPA plan to reverse the Obama-era methane leaks rule\nPosted on 9 September 2019 by dana1981\nThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\nPresident Trump’s EPA is moving to roll back 2016 Obama administration methane leak regulations for key parts of the oil and gas industry, another example of what seems an across-the-board repudiation of Obama-era environmental and climate change initiatives. The new proposal, if made final, is certain to face legal challenges, with its ultimate fate perhaps being decided only by the administration in office in 2021.\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler in late August signed and later announced a proposed rule that would significantly weaken the methane leak reporting regulations. The proposed approach generally would allow transmission and storage sectors of the industry to self-regulate and self-report leaks of the highly-potent greenhouse gas.\nIn a prepared statement, Wheeler said “methane is valuable, and the industry has an incentive to minimize leaks and maximize its use.” He said that since 1990, “methane emissions across the natural gas industry have fallen by nearly 15%,” and that the new EPA approach “should not stifle this innovation and progress.” Separate rules on volatile organic chemicals “also reduce methane,” making the existing rule “redundant,” Wheeler argued.\nSome large oil and gas companies, including BP, Exxon, and Shell, had voiced opposition to the new rules rollback.\nBut smaller companies and the industry’s principal trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, with more than 620 oil and gas company members, had pushed for weakening the methane regulations. They argue that mandated leak inspections are too costly and could make operation of small, often-leaky wells uneconomical. Wheeler appeared persuaded by these arguments, announcing that the new plan “removes unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry” and will save fossil fuel companies around $100 million over the next six years.\nThe larger oil and gas companies appear to have opposed the new EPA move at least in part because their natural gas interests benefit from being seen as a climate-friendly alternative to coal, and a “bridge fuel” for the transition from coal to renewable energy.\nBut some scientific research has suggested that methane leakage from natural gas infrastructure such as fracking can erase much of its claimed climate benefits. For instance, authors of a 2018 study published in Science found that the amount of methane resulting from leaks exceeds by 60% the estimates made by EPA. “Considerable amounts of the greenhouse gas methane leak from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain,” the authors of that study wrote. They said the difference between EPA’s estimates and their own are the result of “current inventory methods [that] miss emissions that occur during abnormal operating conditions.”\nMethane and CO2 comparisons\nCarbon dioxide exceeds by a factor of more than 200 times the levels of methane in Earth’s atmosphere, but methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, in 2013 estimated that the greenhouse effect from methane is 34 times stronger than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period, and 86 times stronger over a 20-year period. Its potency decreases over time because methane is a relatively short-lived greenhouse gas, mostly breaking down under chemical reactions after about 12 years, whereas carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for centuries.\nHowever, a 2017 study noted that most of the heat trapped by methane and other greenhouse gases is absorbed by the oceans and transported through Earth’s climate system for hundreds of years. As a result, their effects on climate impacts like sea-level rise last well beyond just the individual greenhouse gases’ atmospheric lifetimes.\nOverall, methane is responsible for about 16% of human-caused global warming, carbon dioxide for 65%.\nMethane levels in the atmosphere had flattened out between the years 2000 and 2006 but have risen sharply since then. Scientists have struggled to determine the source of this rise – could it be from agriculture (e.g. cattle burps), tropical wetlands, and/or fossil fuels?\nSome previous studies have suggested agriculture could be the primary source, but an August 2019 study in Biogeosciences concluded, “shale-gas production in North America over the past decade may have contributed more than half of all of the increased [methane] emissions from fossil fuels globally and approximately one-third of the total increased emissions from all sources globally over the past decade … the commercialization of shale gas and oil in the 21st century has dramatically increased global methane emissions.”\nShale gas production has boomed in the U.S. in recent years as a result of a rapid expansion of fracking, lending weight to this conclusion. And the industry is poised to continue expanding – a recent report from the advocacy group Food & Water Watch found more than 700 fracked gas infrastructure projects recently built or proposed for development in the U.S.\nClick here to read the rest"

   "paragraph": "SkS Analogy 20 - The Tides of Earth\nPosted on 5 September 2019 by Evan, jg\nTag Line\nHeavenly bodies regularly cause sea level to change by 0.5 to 120 m (2 to 400 ft).\nHuman bodies can cause sea level to change by 60 m (200 ft).\nElevator Statement\nYou’ve heard it said, “The climate is always changing.” What does that mean?\nIf someone said, “Mr. Smith is always falling down”, you would assume that Mr. Smith is unstable.\nWhen you hear the phrase “The climate is always changing,” you might think, “I wonder why the climate is so unstable and always changing?” On 100,000-year cycles the global average temperature varies by 5°C, which causes variation in sea level of 120 m (400 ft). That is a lot!\nThese massive, 120-m glacial tides are caused by heavenly bodies that are hundreds of millions of miles away, tugging on what appears to be a very sensitive environmental system, causing regular, massive changes.\nIs it possible that 8,000,000,000 human bodies pushing hard on this same, sensitive environmental system could cause a similar effect?\nClimate Science\nThe tides of Earth include …\nDaily tides: Controlled by daily changes in the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and the Sun.\nSpring tides: Higher than daily tides, and occurring every 14 days when the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon are aligned.\nKing tides: Higher than Spring tides, and occurring once a year when the Earth is at perihelion (orbit of Earth closest to the Sun) and the moon is at perigee (orbit of Moon closest to the Earth).\nGlacial “tides”1: Fluctuating sea level up to 120 m (400 ft), occurring over 100,000-year cycles and primarily influenced by the effects of Jupiter and Saturn on the orbital dynamics of the Earth.\nThe Sun and Moon pull on the oceans, causing bulges in their shape that cause local fluctuations of sea level.\nJupiter and Saturn pull on the Earth, causing bulges and wobbles in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. The influence on Earth’s orbital dynamics caused by Jupiter and Saturn are called Milankovitch cycles, named after a Serbian mathematician, Milutin Milankovitch.2 Because the orbits of planets are very regular, the Milankovitch cycles cause bulges and wobbles in Earth’s orbit that operate over 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 years. The Milankovitch cycles drive the current ice-age variations.3\nChanges in the orbital dynamics caused by Milankovitch cycles affect the distribution of sunlight between the northern and southern hemispheres. When the northern hemisphere receives less sunlight, large glaciers form over North America and Europe. The water used to form the large glaciers comes from the oceans, causing sea level to drop globally by up to 120 m. When the northern hemisphere receives more sunlight the glaciers melt, and sea level rises. The driver of these massive changes is not the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, but rather feedbacks that are triggered by Jupiter and Saturn.\nWhat are feedbacks? Speak into a microphone connected to an amplifier set on high-gain. Your voice into the microphone triggers a set of feedbacks that repeatedly amplify your original words until a loud squeal comes out of the speakers. Your voice does not cause the squeal, but triggers a set of feedbacks, which in turn cause the squeal.4 A similar process occurs during Milankovitch cycles where a small change in the orbit of the Earth causes a small amount of warming, which triggers feedbacks that eventually lead to large changes in CO2, temperature, and sea level.5\nThe sequence of events of how Jupiter and Saturn trigger 120-m sea-level change is6\nJupiter and Saturn affect Earth’s orbital dynamics, changing the energy distribution between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, which causes a small temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThis small temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere causes about a 10-ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration\nFeedbacks cause the 10-ppm CO2 increase to further increase the temperature, which causes a further increase in CO2, which causes a further increase of temperature, …\nThis cycle goes on until the initial, direct effects combined with the feedbacks cause …\n• CO2 to change by 100 ppm …\n• Which changes global, average temperature by 5°C …\n• Which causes sea level to change by 120 m\nThe direct effect of Jupiter and Saturn is to cause a 10-ppm change in CO2. The feedbacks in Earth’s climate do the rest to cause the 100-ppm CO2 change.\nIf planets 100’s of millions of miles away can trigger 120-m tides, is there anything that human civilization is doing today that could trigger feedbacks in our sensitive, unstable environment?\nBy burning fossil fuels we’ve increased CO2 by 130 ppm in 200 years, 13 times the initial CO2 pulse during an ice-age cycle.\nWe live in an era of Earth’s history with very sensitive climate-feedback dynamics.\nCO2 is currently increasing about 2.5 ppm/year. This represents a continuous, hard push on the environment.\nWhat kind of feedbacks will we trigger if we keep pushing hard on our sensitive climate system?\nFootnotes\n1. “Glacial tide” is a term we define for this analogy. It does not refer to direct, tidal influences such as the Sun and the Moon exert on the oceans, but simply refers to the fact that in the same way that the relative orbital dynamics of the Sun, Moon, and the Earth cause periodic sea-level fluctuations, the relative orbital dynamics of Jupiter, Saturn, Sun, and Earth cause periodic sea-level fluctuations. The Sun and Moon cause tidal fluctuations with a period of about 12 hours and simply cause a local redistribution of water up and down a local shoreline, whereas Jupiter and Saturn cause fluctuations with a period of about 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 years, and which redistribute water between the oceans and the land.\n2. https://www.skepticalscience.com/Milankovitch.html\n3. Read here for information about ice ages and glaciation cycles.\n4. The feedback process is something like: small soundwave (trigger) into microphone -> electrical signal -> amplified electrical signal -> louder sound wave out of speaker and back into microphone -> stronger electrical signal -> amplified stronger electrical signal -> really big sound wave out of speaker and back into microphone -> …\n5. https://skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature.htm\n6. The dynamics of how the distribution of sunlight between the northern and southern hemispheres causes the complex feedback between CO2 and temperature leading to large-scale glacial formation/retreat is beyond the scope of this analogy.

In 2016, we teamed up with authors of six other consensus studies to publish Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming. This week, our Consensus on Consensus study just went past 500,000 downloads.\nReplication is the heart of the scientific method. When multiple scientific studies, using independent methods, all arrive at similar conclusions, we become more confident that our scientific understanding is correct. This is why scientists are so confident that humans are causing global warming: multiple lines of evidence all find human fingerprints in climate change. In the same way, we know there is a scientific consensus because multiple studies independently find overwhelming scientific agreement that humans are causing global warming.\nSo I was always bemused by the fact that our 2013 consensus study received so many attacks, as if this would singlehandedly overturn the 97% consensus on human-caused global warming. This sentiment is most explicitly articulated by Senator Ted Cruz who argued that the 97% consensus was based \"on one bogus study.\" The simplest retort to this argument is that the 97% consensus has been confirmed by multiple studies, including Doran & Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al 2010, and Carlton et al. 2015.\nSo imagine our surprise when Richard Tol, who threw critique after critique at our 2013 consensus study, unveiled a new line of attack: our 97% consensus was an outlier compared to other studies. This was a valiant attempt at ju jitsu, turning the strongest element of our research (consistency with independent studies) into a potential weakness (claiming our research conflicted with other studies). However, in order to make this argument, Tol misrepresented the other consensus studies beyond recognition, much to the indignation of the authors of those studies.\nWhile Tol's egregious misinformation is problematic, it did inspire the authors of seven leading consensus studies to collaborate on the Consensus on consensus study. We summarized the level of agreement among climate scientists on climate change - establishing that no matter how you approach it, there is overwhelming agreement that humans are causing global warming. And now that the study has been downloaded a half million times, you could argue that Tol's efforts have led to raising awareness of the robust nature of the consensus on climate change.\nThe other important contribution of Consensus on consensus was shining disinfecting sunlight on a common strategy used to cast doubt on expert consensus: the fake expert technique. This involves citing people who convey the impression of expertise but don't possess the relevant expertise on a specific scientific matter. The tobacco industry perfected this technique in advertisements citing general scientists, doctors, or educators - people who convey the impression of expertise but have never actually researched the health impacts of smoking.\nIn Consensus on consensus, we showed that agreement on human-caused global warming increases with expertise in climate science. This means that if one cherry picks sub-groups of scientists with less expertise in climate change (e.g., economic geologists), you can obtain lower levels of agreement. When you hear of a scientific group with low levels of agreement on human-caused global warming, this group consists of fake experts. Tol used this technique by selecting sub-groups of non-climate-experts from various consensus studies, to argue that they found lower consensus than 97%.\nWhile much of my research has been spent on quantifying the consensus, even more of my work has focused on communicating the consensus. Two of my experimental studies, Rational Irrationality and Neutralizing misinformation through inoculation, demonstrated how effective communicating the scientific consensus is in raising awareness of the reality of climate change and neutralizing misinformation. However, these two studies are only two amongst a much larger body of evidence confirming the efficacy of communicating the consensus. This is why I created a Consensus on Consensus Messaging post summarizing the research into consensus communication. Communicating the consensus is an important part of raising climate literacy and building public support for climate action."

   "paragraph": "A lecture program about climate change for people with learning disabilities\nPosted on 30 August 2019 by BaerbelW\nEarlier this year I was asked if I could support a lecture program about climate change for people with learning disabilities. The program was organised by Christa Rommel who works at the Remstal Werkstätten which are part of the Diakonie Stetten in southern Germany. They regularly offer such lecture programs for the people working there in order to have them learn about and get involved with general societal topics. One of the biggest challenges of such programs is that the information has to be presented in easy to understand language. This write-up is a short summary of the program with the emphasis on the part I was actively involved with. A report about the full program was put together by Christa Rommel and you can download it (in German) here.\nThe program was divided into three parts, happening within one week in February 2019:\nDay 1 featured an inhouse lecture about the basics of human-caused climate change held by Jürgen Lutz\nOn day 2 I met the group in the Wilhelma, the zoological and botanical garden in Stuttgart for a climate-themed tour which also included information presented by Benedikt Mathes, one of the participants\nDay 3 was used to summarise what the group learned during the program and how they already try to lessen their own carbon footprint\nHere are some impressions from the Wilhelma-tour with translations of easy to understand wording used in the report.\nDuring the tour on a sunny February morning I for example explained the following:\nHow the greenhouse effect works - using some of our graphics\nWhy global warming impacts many animal and plant species. With the South African penguins we have at the Wilhelma as an example where it's not yet clear if the impacts will overall be negative or positive. They depend on ocean currents and how changes in them will affect the penguin's main food source: fish\nThat some species like insects may profit by moving into other areas, and that some of them sting and can spread diseases\nBenedikt Mathes, one of the participants, supported the tour with sharing some information he had prepared based on material from the exhibition \"Donnerwetter! Klima schreibt Geschichte\" in the Municipal Museum in Heilbronn.\nWe ended the tour with the story about how marine mammals help climate scientists to gather data. Something, the participants found as fascinating as I did!\nWeddell Seal West Antarctic Peninsula (photo: Dan Costa - NMFS 87-1851-03)\nIn case you'd like to see/read the write-up prepared by Christa Rommel and some of the participants, you can download the PDF here - it's however in German and - because it will get shared within the institution - it is written in easy to understand language (and doesn't go into too much detail).\nThis for sure was an interesting and challenging project for me to be involved with!"

   "title": "IPCC's land report showed we're entering an era of damage control",
   "paragraph": "IPCC's land report showed we're entering an era of damage control\nPosted on 29 August 2019 by dana1981\nThe IPCC has published a new report on climate and land. The report includes chapters on land-climate interactions (land use changes are accelerating global warming, which is causing more extreme weather), desertification (deserts are expanding), land degradation (declining quality of soil, for example), and food security. The latter is a particularly critical topic, given our dependence on food and water supplies for survival.\nThe report notes that humans struggle to efficiently manage our food supply. Between 25 and 30 percent of the food we produce worldwide is wasted. This waste happens for different reasons in different regions – in developed countries, consumers throw out excess food, while in developing countries much of the waste is due to a lack of refrigeration as products go bad between producers and consumers. And of course refrigeration requires energy, meaning that mitigating the latter problem will generate more greenhouse gas emissions. The report estimates that food waste costs about $1 trillion per year and accounts for about 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from food systems. Meanwhile, 2 billion humans are overweight or obese while nearly 1 billion are undernourished, highlighting the inefficiencies and inequities in our food distribution.\nOverall, 23 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry, and other land use. Much of this is due to emissions of the more potent greenhouse gases methane (from cattle and rice farming, for example) and nitrous oxide (from nitrogen-fertilized agricultural soils). The figure is comparable to the transportation sector (approximately 15 percent of total human greenhouse gas emissions) and electricity and heat (approximately 30 percent). The report notes that diets heavier in meat and particularly beef adversely impact both greenhouse gas emissions and health outcomes.\nPotential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from changing diets by 2050, per the research cited in the IPCC report.\nContinued global warming and the associated intensification of extreme weather are expected to decrease yields in many crops. While farmers can adapt in some ways – using more land, changing the crops they grow, and raising prices – those higher costs will be passed on to consumers. The IPCC report notes that climate change and the socioeconomic path we follow will combine to determine how much food insecurity humanity faces in the coming decades.\nAs food prices rise, if the number of people in poverty is also increasing, that combination could create widespread hunger crises. The IPCC report envisions various different ‘Shared Socioeconomic Pathways’ in which factors like global population, poverty, inequality, food waste, and diets vary. In a world with a large population, high inequality and poverty, inefficient food use and diets, the risk of food insecurity becomes high at 1.5°C (2.7°F) and very high at 2.5°C (4.5°F). If we follow a more sustainable socioeconomic scenario with a stable global population, low inequality and poverty, efficient food use and diets, the risk of food insecurity becomes high closer to 3°C (5.4°F). Water scarcity is a similar story, with high risks at 1.5°C if we follow a less sustainable socioeconomic pathway, and closer to 3°C if population growth and income inequality are minimized.\nThe importance of these factors in avoiding widespread crises among poorer populations is among the reasons why modern climate policy proposals like the Green New Deal are aimed at alleviating both inequality and climate change. Adding to the challenge, the nutritional content of many crops, including wheat and rice, will decline in a world with more heat and carbon dioxide. Higher temperatures will also make fruits and vegetables rot more quickly, thus exacerbating the problem of food waste and energy needed for refrigeration.\nIn short, preventing food and water scarcity in a world with more intense heat and droughts will be a challenge. Slowing global warming by curbing greenhouse gas emissions will help mitigate the problem, but the risks will also depend on the size of the population remaining in poverty. Hence climate policy solutions must address both emissions and socioeconomic inequalities.\nThe IPCC report lists various adaptation and mitigation measures that could be implemented, including more sustainable food production and diets (more plant-based, less meat-based), improved forest management (including reducing deforestation and increasing reforestation), agricultural carbon sequestration (including no-till farming practices), and reducing food waste. And it warns that delaying action will be costly:\n“Deferral of [greenhouse gas] emissions reductions from all sectors implies trade-offs including irreversible loss in land ecosystem functions and services required for food, health, habitable settlements and production, leading to increasingly significant economic impacts on many countries in many regions of the world. Delaying action as is assumed in high emissions scenarios could result in some irreversible impacts on some ecosystems, which in the longer-term has the potential to lead to substantial additional [greenhouse gas] emissions from ecosystems that would accelerate global warming.”\nLast year’s IPCC Special Report on climate impacts at 1.5°C concluded that to limit global warming to this level, global greenhouse gas emissions need to decline by about 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030, which led to many headlines and declarations that we only have 12 years left to avert a climate catastrophe. Reality is more complicated than this simple message; for example, how one defines “catastrophe” is subjective. The IPCC land report documents that the risks associated with food and water insecurity, extreme weather, desertification, land degradation, human conflict, and other climate change threats will only grow as temperatures rise above today’s level of 1°C hotter than pre-industrial temperatures.\nHowever, the report also illustrates that in combination with sustainable and equitable growth, we can always reduce those threats beyond what they would be at higher global temperatures. We are essentially entering an era of permanent damage control. That may not make for as sexy a headline as ’12 years to avert catastrophe,’ but it more accurately describes our state of affairs."

   "title": "Why German coal power is falling fast in 2019",
   "paragraph": "Why German coal power is falling fast in 2019\nPosted on 26 August 2019 by Guest Author\nThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief by Karsten Capion\nKarsten Capion is senior adviser at Danish Energy, the membership body for the Danish energy industry. In August, he will be joining the Danish Council on Climate Change (Klimarådet) as chief analyst. This is broadly equivalent to the UK’s Committee on Climate Change.\nGermany generated significantly less electricity from coal-fired power stations in the first half of 2019, with output down by more than a fifth compared to a year earlier.\nGeneration from brown coal (lignite) was down by 14 terawatt hours (TWh, 21%) and hard coal was down by 8TWh (24%). With gas generation only increasing moderately (3TWh), the German power sector’s emissions fell by 20m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2, 19%).\nThis dramatic shift in Germany’s power sector comes as the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) recently outlined its plan for a complete coal phaseout no later than 2038, in line with the recommendations of the country’s coal commission.\nThe BMWi plan would include auctions for compensation payments to hard coal plants shutting down early, even though many of these plants have been sitting idle for large parts of 2019 to date.\nIn this article, I look at why German coal generation is becoming less profitable as a result of much higher carbon prices, against a backdrop of continued increases in renewable generation.\nGeneration change\nThe EU’s largest economy is also its most polluting, with Germany accounting for roughly a third of all electricity-related CO2 emissions in the bloc. Around half of EU electricity generation from brown coal (lignite) takes place in Germany, as well as a quarter of the total for hard coal.\n(Lignite is a soft brown coal formed from compressed peat. It has higher water content than hard coal and so causes much higher CO2 emissions per unit of energy when it is burnt.)\nAfter years of steady output, German electricity generation from coal has been falling fast in 2019. Hard coal output had already seen declines over the past few years, as the chart below shows (black line), whereas brown coal generation (brown) had been resilient until much more recently.\nMonthly electricity generation from lignite (brown line) and hard coal (black), terawatt hours, from January 2010 through the end of June 2019. Source: Energy Charts. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nIn the first half of 2019, hard coal generation is 8TWh (24%) lower than a year earlier, while lignite is down 14TWh (21%) – with coal down 22TWh (22%) in total and 44TWh (36%) over five years.\nThe gap left by coal-fired electricity has been largely filled by renewables, with output from German windfarms up by 11TWh (19%) and solar up by 1TWh (6%) in the first half of 2019, while demand fell by 9TWh (3%) and gas generation only increased by 3TWh (16%). The shift means wind is on track to become the single largest source of electricity in Germany this year, overtaking lignite.\nIn total, these changes mean that emissions from Germany’s electricity sector were down 20MtCO2 (around 19%) in the first half of the year, compared to the same period in 2018.\nThe German environment ministry has previously projected a 32% reduction in power sector emissions by 2020, compared to 1990 levels. The rapid falls this year mean this estimate is likely to be exceeded.\nIf savings continue at a similar rate in the second half of 2019, then emissions from the sector would fall by 40MtCO2. This is equivalent to 3 percentage points towards Germany’s now abandoned 40% emissions reduction target for 2020, which is nevertheless still likely to be missed.\nIdle capacity\nNotably, the decline in coal generation in 2019 has happened without any major power station closures. According to Energy Charts, a website maintained by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, the installed hard coal capacity is 23.7 gigawatts (GW, red line in the chart, below), but maximum output this year has not exceeded 17.4GW (blue line) and has stayed below 11.2GW since March.\nMonthly electricity generation from lignite (brown line) and hard coal (black), terawatt hours, from January 2010 through the end of June 2019. Source: Energy Charts. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nThis low utilisation means Germany’s hard coal fleet, even at maximum output, has been running well below half its installed capacity since March. In the first half of the year overall, the fleet averaged 25% of its potential output. Similarly, lignite plants have averaged just 57% of their potential output in the same period – albeit with large differences between individual power stations.\nA number of lignite plants have stopped generating over the past few years and are being kept open as “reserve” capacity in case of shortages. Some 2.7GW will gradually be moved into the reserve during 2016-2019, leaving 18.5GW operating in the German electricity market. While important, however, this can only explain a small part of the decline in lignite output since last year.\nMost of this idleness can be attributed to renewables generating more electricity and the fact that many gas-fired power plants are now cheaper than their coal competitors, due to lower gas prices and higher carbon costs on the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).\nThis highlights the fact that CO2 emissions from coal can be reduced without closing down coal-fired power stations – and that coal capacity does not automatically translate into emissions.\nReducing operation through a higher price on carbon instead of actively shutting down plants could even be more effective from an economic point of view, since it would reduce emissions without necessitating compensation payments for forced retirements. The UK carbon price floor has been a significant contributor to the country’s success in phasing out of coal, for example, helping keep remaining coal plants idle, with more than half the hours this year seeing no coal generation at all.\nMarket prices\nThe recent decline for hard coal generation has also come despite falling fuel prices. In April of this year, the cost of emitting CO2 (red line) overtook the cost of buying hard coal for a typical power plant (grey), as the chart below shows. This switch is also a result of a surge in EU carbon prices since reforms were agreed in late 2017.\nContributions from fuel (grey line) and CO2 permits (red) to total running costs to generate a unit of electricity at a typical hard coal power plant (blue), excluding operations, maintenance, fixed costs and investments in lifetime extensions. Source: Authors calculations based on data from SysPower. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nAt the end of June 2019, hard coal was trading at just above $50 per tonne. Such low prices are unlikely to be sustained, given it is below the $66/tonne expected by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Sustainable Development Scenario, where coal demand drops dramatically worldwide.\nWith a rebound in coal prices and carbon prices remaining stable – as expected by the forwards markets – hard coal running costs are likely to reach around €50 per megawatt hour (MWh), up from closer to €40/MWh today.\nThis figure excludes fixed operating costs and investments needed to renew equipment and meet more stringent air pollution rules. A cost of €50/MWh is also around the same level as expected power prices in Germany, meaning margins will be small for the country’s hard coal fleet.\nWhile hard coal use has been falling steadily for years, lignite has seemed less susceptible to the effects of the green transition. This is because lignite plants have lower running costs, using fuel extracted from large surface mines nearby rather than from deep mines that are often overseas.\nThat position finally changed this year, as increased wind generation, declining demand and lower gas prices resulted in a smaller market for coal. It was further exacerbated by the price of carbon rising from just €5 per tonne of CO2 two years ago to about €28/tCO2 today, which hits lignite particularly hard due to its very high emissions per unit of electricity generated.\nThe net result is that lignite operators’ margins have been squeezed in recent months, with total revenues across the German fleet (red line in the chart, below) barely covering the costs of carbon (blue) – let alone fuel or other fixed costs such as salaries.\nTotal revenues from electricity sales (red) and the cost of carbon allowances (blue) for all German lignite plants by month. Source: Author calculations based on data from SysPower and Energy Charts. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nThis squeeze on lignite profitability has started to produce real consequences for power plant owners. One major utility, EnBW, took its 900 megawatt (MW) Lippendorf S lignite unit out of operation on 15 June 2019, saying that “current framework conditions do not permit economic operation”.\nThis is a reflection of the substantial shift in lignite profitability over the past two years, shown in the chart, below. In general, lignite power plants have higher output (shown on the y-axis) in hours when electricity prices are high (x-axis). Comparing this distribution in June 2019 (red dots) with the same month in 2017 (blue) shows how much less the plants have been switching on.\nHourly output from German lignite plants (gigawatts) as a function of electricity prices (€/MWh) in June 2017 (blue dots) compared with June 2019 (red). Source: Energy Charts. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nMost remarkable is the increase in the “drop-off price” under which lignite plants significantly reduce their output, from about €10/MWh in 2017 to about €30/MWh in 2019. This price is the point below which plants are unable to operate without losing money.\nMaximum output has also fallen in 2019 as a few lignite units are permanently offline, while minimum output has been reduced too. The latter is due to plants shutting off completely during extended periods of high renewable generation.\nUntil recently, lignite plants rarely shut off completely, as periods of uneconomic operation were typically short enough to justify loss-making operation instead of paying the associated costs of switching off and then re-starting the power station. That meant that lignite plants were running more or less continuously outside of planned maintenance.\nA few points in the chart above also shows the new dynamic where lignite output remains low even during some periods of high electricity prices. This is due to some plants switching off for economic reasons and being unavailable to fire up quickly during short periods of high prices, when prices are otherwise low.\nCarbon futures\nLooking ahead, the current market expectation is that lignite revenues will increase slightly over the next few years, with gas prices due to rise and competition from nuclear plants disappearing as Germany completes its phaseout of the technology by 2022.\nThis means lignite generation could rebound in the short term, as plants are expected to become cheaper to run (brown line in the chart, below) than their gas counterparts (blue line).\nRunning costs to generate a unit of electricity at a typical gas (blue line), hard coal (black) or lignite power plant (brown), excluding operations, maintenance and life time extensions. Historical figures are shown with a solid line. Projections, in the shaded area, are based on forwards markets. Source: Author calculations using data from SysPower. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts.\nDespite this potential rebound, however, the price difference between running a lignite and gas-fired power plant seems set to remain small – whereas, previously, brown coal had a large cost advantage.\nThis means that the days when lignite running costs were low and power prices (set by gas and hard coal) were high will probably not return. Furthermore, the emergence of subsidy-free renewables are likely to cap long term electricity prices, even in the event of rising gas prices.\nThe chart above may even overstate the profitability of lignite plants, as it assumes a short-term running cost of just €10/MWh. Longer-term running costs – on top of carbon costs – could be as much as €22/MWh, according to thinktank IEEFA, citing figures from German lignite operator RWE. This still does not factor in costs for upgrades to comply with tighter environmental standards for local air pollution.\nWith renewable generation set to continue growing rapidly and prospects for carbon prices remaining buoyant, the end for German coal could arrive sooner than expected."

Photograph: Victor Moriyama/Getty\nWhen G7 leaders sit in judgment on Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro this weekend, the question they should ask themselves is whether the rape of the natural world should finally be treated as a crime. The language of sexual violence will be familiar to the former army captain, who publicly admires the sadistic torturers of the dictatorship era and once said to a congresswoman, “I would never rape you because you are not worth it.” Last month, after Pope Francis and European leaders expressed concern about the Amazon, Bolsonaro lashed back by claiming: “Brazil is a virgin that every foreign pervert desires.”\nAs a nationalist, the president sees the Amazon in terms of ownership and sovereignty. As a chauvinist, he sees the region as a possession to be exploited and opened up, rather than cherished and nurtured.\nSince taking power eight months ago, Bolsonaro has, layer by layer, stripped the rainforest of protections. First, he weakened the environment ministry and put it in the hands of a minister convicted of environmental fraud. Second, he undermined the agency responsible for monitoring the forest, Ibama. Third, he alienated Norway and Germany, the main donors to forest-protection causes. Fourth, he tried to hide what was happening by sacking the head of the space agency responsible for satellite data on destruction. Fifth, he accused environmental charities of starting fires and working for foreign interests. And sixth, he verbally attacked Amazon dwellers – the indigenous and Quilombola communities who depend on a healthy forest.\nWith these defences down, the president has encouraged outsiders from the mining, logging and farming industries to take advantage of economic opportunities. The results have been brutal. Last month, deforestation surged by 278%. This month is almost certain to be a record for August under the current monitoring system. The wounds are impossible to cover up.

   "title": "Market Forces and Coal",
   "paragraph": "Market Forces and Coal\nPosted on 19 August 2019 by Riduna\nFollowing defeat of the Australian Labor Party in the Federal election a leading Member has suggested that the Party should not rely on the use of Market Forces as the basis for curbing emissions. This would be a mistake since it is these forces, particularly those of supply and demand, which governments can not resist - no matter how ill-disposed to rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions they may be.\nSupply and demand are influenced by price, reliability, cost to use, appearance and many other comparative factors. Simply put, a manufacturer will not produce goods or services unless cost of production enables him to compete profitably with other producers. Consumers are unlikely to purchase a product unless it is deemed to have advantages over other products.\nInto this mix has been inserted new, highly disruptive, though still evolving technology in the form of renewable energy generation. It is disruptive because it enables radical departure from existing, often long-standing technology to which we have all become accustomed. It offers cheaper, more efficient production of goods and services which can be supplied to consumers at lower prices, though more profitably. Nowhere is this more evident than in the generation, storage and use of electricity.\nCoal\nDemand for coal is primarily created by demand for electricity, steel, bitumen and other products. The fact that the Adani coal mine will be built and will export coal to India is a natural response to this demand – and the demand for more jobs in Regional Queensland. It will not help reduce greenhouse gas emissions but it is a natural response to market forces.\nDemand for the end-products of coal is likely to increase in coming years because of a growing population and expanding economic growth, giving the impression that the future of the coal industry is secure. Not so, because electricity generated from renewable sources, primarily wind and solar, is now cheaper than electricity generated from new coal-fired power stations while old power stations are closing because essential maintenance is becoming more pervasive and expensive.\nAustralia is unquestionably the worlds’ leading exporter of coal. In 2017 it exported 202 million tonnes of thermal coal which was used to generate electricity and 177 million tonnes of coking coal used for smelting and other purposes. In addition, Australian coal mines produced and sold some 44 million tonnes for domestic consumption, mostly for power generation. However coal production is prone to contraction due to falling internal and external demand and other factors such as price or availability of substitutes such as Liquified Natural Gas.\nDomestic Demand\nIn 2018 Australia had 19 coal fired power stations in operation, generating about 62% of its electricity with the balance coming from oil and gas-fired power stations (23%) and renewables (15%).\nFig 1. Rapid expansion of large-scale solar Photovoltaic (PV) generation is expected by the end of 2019 with new capacity of 1,570 MW commissioned in 2018 and 4 - 5,000 MW likely to complete in 2019. Source of graphic: Wikipedia.\nAustralia's coal-fired power stations have a nominal capacity to generate 24,970 MW. With closure of 4 stations likely by 2030 (5,654 MW) and a further 11 (16,151 MW) closing by 2040, leaving 4 stations (3,165 MW) which may operate beyond 2040. It is possible, indeed likely, that all 19 power stations could close by 2030 without causing any failure to meet national demand for electricity. The reason for this is, as shown in Fig 2. below, the investment pipeline in renewable energy has a generating capacity of 29,307 MW, exceeding the nominal capacity of coal fired power stations now in operation.\nFig. 2. The Pipeline comprises approved projects which have commenced/not commenced but are likely to be commissioned by 2025. It excludes mega-projects: Snowy 2.0 (2 GW), Pilbara Power Hub (9-12 GW) and the NSW Power Hub (4 GW) since funding, start and stage completion dates are uncertain. Source: Authors research and Clean Energy Council data.\nProponents of coal fired power generation correctly point out that renewables only generate electricity when the sun shines or the wind blows, while demand is for reliable dispatchable energy supplied 24/7. This problem is being overcome in three ways:\n1. The Pipeline includes pumped hydro and battery storage of 2.115 GW to help ensure continuity of supply.\n2. Snowy 2.0 is likely to be commissioned well before 2030 and provide an additional 2 GW back-up for solar and wind.\n3. Solid State battery technology promises cheaper, more stable batteries with up to 3 times storage density of lithium-ion batteries now in use and is likely to be commercialised by 2025, possibly sooner.\nIt is currently estimated that 35% of Pipeline projects, with around 5-8 GW generating capacity will be completed and connect to the Grid in 2019, further eroding the use of coal which, as shown in Fig 3, has contracted by about 24% over the last decade.\nFig 3. Decline in Australian domestic coal consumption 2007 - 18, shown in millions of metric tonnes. Source: CEICDATA.\nAdvances in solid state battery technology will result in cheaper electricity storage, expansion of small-scale solar with generating capacity of >8 GW, and fall in its dependence on the Grid for back-up. The present cost of Grid-scale battery storage is likely to fall by as much as 50% and will be supported by larger pumped-hydro projects such as Snowy 2.0. Most of these developments are likely by 2025 and would see further, more rapid decline in the use of fossil fuels, to generate electricity.\nBy 2030 domestic demand for coal to generate electricity could be reduced to zero, implying that coal mining production would be forced to contract possibly by 40 million tonnes over the next decade.\nExport Demand\nAustralia is the largest coal exporter in the world. In 2016/17 it exported 379 million tonnes comprising 45.7% coking coal largely used for smelting iron ore and 54.3 % thermal coal used for generating electricity. As shown in Fig 4, the bulk of these exports were to Asian countries, with 5 countries accounting for 86.9% of all export destinations.\nCoking or ‘metallurgical ‘ coal is described as a non-substitutable material used in production of steel from iron ore. In fact hydrogen can perform the same reductive task and the Swedish Government is involved in a prototype steel works using hydrogen rather than coking coal to smelt iron ore. However, wide-scale adoption of hydrogen for this purpose seems unlikely for at least a decade.\nOther factors more likely to affect future demand and use of coking coal are a decline in demand for steel due to regional or global economic downturn or, more significantly, greater use of scrap metal as the source of steel products. The latter is likely to grow significantly as electric vehicles begin to rapidly replace those driven by internal combustion engines after 2025, resulting in rapid increase in availability of scrap metal which is often recovered using electric furnaces.\nMajor importing counties, notably Japan, China, Korea and India, seek to become more self-sufficient in coking coal through increased domestic production, thereby conserving foreign exchange needed for purchase of other imports and improving self-reliance. All of these factors are likely to result in declining demand for coking coal by 2030, with more rapid decline possible thereafter as hydrogen becomes more widely used for smelting.\nFig 4. Coal exports to Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and India account for 87% of all Australian coal exports so future intentions of these countries merit special attention. Source of data: Australian Dept. of Industry: Thermal Tonnage. Coking Tonnage.\nDecline in demand for thermal coal may be more rapid and sustained, as evidenced by the future intentions of major importers expressed by their policies, actions and commitments under the Paris Accord.\nJapan: In 2018 climate events cost it US$27.5 billion. Severity of such events will increase in coming years unless it - and other countries – decarbonise their economies. An added imperative is the need to generate electricity at a cost which is no more than the cost of its competitors if its trading activities are to remain competitive. Realising this, Japan intends to reduce its emissions to 26% below 2005 levels.\nThe Government has determined that it should decarbonise the economy by about 2050 and to this end generate energy from renewable sources by using hydrogen for transport and steel production, increase use of renewables and possibly reopen its nuclear generators. The net result is reduction in use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, though a timetable and targets are not specified in the Government Policy Paper.\nChina has indicated policies aimed at increasing size and efficiency of domestic coal production by limiting 2019 imports to 2018 level. These policies have resulted in lower thermal and coking coal imports from Australia in 2019 and likely to further reduce in future years as China increases coal imports from Russia and Mongolia – already a matter of concern to the Minerals Council – a strong advocate of coal production.\nThe USA trade war with China could see reduced steel exports and possibly reduced demand for Australian coking coal and iron ore. Demand for thermal coal may also contract due to proposed new Chinese investment ($360 billion) in renewable electricity generation and a change in policy away from an export focussed economy to one more reliant on production for the domestic market.\nIndia was the worlds’ largest importer of Australian coking coal in 2017, accounting for over 90% of its imports. It has now reduced dependence on Australia by diversifying the source of coking coal by importing from Canada, USA, Mozambique and South Africa. As a result future Australian exports are expected to reduce by around 36 million tonnes.\nThe Carmichael (Adani) coal mine in Queensland proposes exporting 10-15 million tonnes of thermal coal to India annually for use in Adani power plants for as long as permitted by the Indian government. However, the latter is pursuing a policy of self-sufficiency in thermal coal and rapidly increasing the contribution of renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by 2022 which, if achieved, would significantly reduce the need for thermal coal imports.\nSouth Korea: President Moon Jae-in, a reformist, has committed his government to rapid transition to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels, particularly coal. Central to these reforms is closure of 14 coal-fired power stations, limitations on output of 42 other coal-fired power stations and increasing renewable energy generation from 8 to 48% - all by 2026, so as to exceed 2030 targets shown below.\nFig 5. 2030 Targets for Korera’s 8thBasic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand (8thBPE) compared with 2017 outcomes. Source: Blomberg NEF.\nIn support of these measures South Korea has increased the tax on coal imports by 28% while lowering tax on LNG imports by 75%, showing strong support for conversion of existing and building of new power stations to burn gas rather than coal and indicating continuing decline in dependence on and import of coal.\nTaiwan’s demand for electricity in 2017 was about 42 GW, generated from Gas (43.4%), Coal (39.2%), Nuclear (9.2%), Hydro (8.1%) and Renewables (<0.1%). It has no coal deposits and relies on imports to meet its energy needs. Taiwan has a detailed plan for transition from fossil fuels to renewables which calls for replacement of nuclear and coal by solar PV and wind farms and by roof-top PV.\nThe plan calls for Solar PV to contribute 20 GW in new renewable capacity by 2025, replacing firstly nuclear capacity (4GW), then coal. Although doubts exist about capacity to achieve 2025 targets, there is far less doubt that those targets will be exceeded by 2030, resulting in significant reduction of coal imports.\nConclusions\nGiven the above analysis and as the effects of global warming increase in frequency and severity, popular pressure on governments will develop, forcing them to strengthen and implement policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly, particularly from burning coal, the single largest source greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activity.\nContraction in demand for coal may initially be evidenced by falling prices rather than falling volumes of production but, when declining demand is sustained it will result in reduced production and mine closures. In terms of volume and value, Australian coal exports may have already begun to decline and, as indicated above, are unlikely to exceed the revenue peaks estimated to be achieved for 2018-19 in the future.\nOver the next decade it is possible that the volume of coal mined in Australia could decline by 25% - 35% for both export (by up to 120 million tonnes) and domestic use (by up to 15 million tonnes) with consequent closure of the least efficient mines with loss of jobs in both coal production and its use.\nIt is in the interests of all parties to plan for orderly contraction of the industry both in terms of public revenues derived from the coal mining industry, employees directly and indirectly employed in it and rehabilitation of mine sites and coal fired power stations. Alternative sources of revenue will need to be identified and legislated for, employees will require retraining and redeployment, while mine site rehabilitation will require agreed funding, legislation and supervision."
